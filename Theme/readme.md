## This is a custsom Visual Studio Code theme that I made...
...to look like my PowerShell ISE theme, "Boss Mode". 

If you want to try it, be my guest.

I've had mixed success with installing the theme with the function that is part of the module [FightingEntropy()],
but I will be making changes to the function so that it installs correctly across the board.
