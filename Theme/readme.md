# README
## This is a custsom Visual Studio Code theme that I made...
...to look like my PowerShell ISE theme, "Boss Mode". 

If you want to try it, be my guest. 
Slap the whole folder into your "$env:userprofile" under '.vscode\extensions'...
...and then you can see if my theme is cool, or not.

The rest is the automatic stuff that came with the utility I used to make it.

## This is the README for your extension "bossmode"
You can author your README using Visual Studio Code.  Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux)
* Toggle preview (`Shift+CMD+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux)
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets
