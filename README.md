# [My Briefcase]

    My Briefcase" used to be a thing that everybody used in (Windows 95/98).
    It's not called "My Briefcase" anymore, but whatever bro.

    It was called, "My Briefcase" because... badass detectives used this friggen thing to
    catalog their adventures throughout the crime riddled badlands of suburban America...
    ...a long and tedious drawn out battle where they're always fighting crime-
    ...and evil doers.

    At least, whenever/wherever they are able to accurately document those events.

    You would not believe some of the true entries that exist in each hair raising
    entry/hour of their patrols and journeys...

    I know what you're thinking...
    "Sounds like a pretty cool *briefcase* to have on hand..."

    Yep.
    "My Briefcase"
    They call it a bunch of other things now, but it used to be, "My Briefcase"...
    and it would even help Scruff McGruff take a mean bite out of crime.
    -
    When you want some real top notch document storage...?

    Then you need the (Windows 95/98) "My Briefcase", limited-edition 25-year minted lunchbox.
    One that you could get right now by calling xxx-yyy-zzzz, or, going to website.org,
    and then submit your details for your chance to win one...

    It's just a thing that could become a daily companion.

    You just- you put either your *documents*, OR your *lunch* in this thing.
    Sometimes even both.

    If that's not your thing? Well... you could go pro,
    and get yourself the *backpack edition*.

    That oughtta appeal to those who wanna do a little MORE top-notch damage...
    ...since the backpack makes the lunchbox look like a little happy meal toy.
    -
    But- if you *really* want to show those evil doers who the boss is...?
    ...and you want to be referred to as a top-notch, platinum-grade, crime fighter..?

    Like, the dude from the Netflix Daredevil show that got axed for no reason...?

    You don't just take a bite out of crime like some little kids coloring book hero...
    That's what Scruff McGruff'll tell you to do when you're in elementary school, kids.

    When you need to be seen as an *adult* that can handle things like a *boss*...?
    Then, you need "My Briefcase" (Roaming RV Edition).
    
    It's a camper. With a living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom...?
    It is literally a mobile domicile that you can park wherever you like.

    When you really want to kick the crap out of crime...?
    Then, you need one of these bad boys.
    -
    The (Roaming RV Edition) comes with a lifetime supply of iced peas.
    Probably sounds like a dumb thing to get a lifetime supply of...
    But- driving around in a crime fighting RV...?
    Those knuckles of yours are bound to get swollen quite often. 
    Mainly because (driving around/living) in an RV that has "crime fighting" in it's name?
    You're gonna be tempted to knock out some bad guys left and right.

    A lifetime supply of iced peas doesn't sound so ridiculous now, does it?

    It'll set you back a good 200K+ for the "My Briefcase" (Roaming RV Edition)
    AKA "Crime Fighting Lab". <- That's the official DMV Registration Code for now.
    They'll find a way to get it onto a license plate I'm sure... but whatever.

    Think about how much crime you could stop with this thing.

    Pretty sure Scruff McGruff will be proud of however much crime you take a bite out of.
    
    Whether you get the RV, the backpack, or the lunchbox.
    Or... all three.
    
    For the people who found their way to FightingEntropy...?
    You don't just stop at taking a little bite out of crime there, Scruff McGruff...

    Nah, cause sometimes... you have to kick the crap out of it too.

    Show crime who the boss is.
