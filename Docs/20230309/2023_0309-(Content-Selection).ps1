             You can.

             I guess what it really comes down to, is uh-

             [other people] about that game...?

And then uh [playing scales] and stuff...?
[Scales] would be a great way to [start out], but then like...

Maybe I'll start out with a [song]...?
And then I'd start [playing] the [song]...?

the [climax] of the film.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:19:24","00:19:43", @'

Right...?

Right...?

The [pacing] of how I talk, right now, in this [recording]...?

It's very uh- [grounded], and I would say that uh- few people are able to pull off, uh-
[speaking the way that I am right now].

And uh- this is [all dynamic], this is all like, [off the cuff].

It's not like, uh- I have a [script] to [read from] as I'm making these things, it's

Right...?
Not unlike how like sometimes I would... start to [practice], my [guitar], and then,

[improvisation] down pat.

He's gonna have a [skit] prepared [AHEAD of time], and he's gonna talk about his [observations],

              ehhh... whaddya want me to do...?

And then like, the person behind him is just like:
[Some guy]: Just go~!

Ya know...?
And then, uh- I guess at [some point], like, the guy like, gets out of his car, and he's like,
he like, rushes up to like, [Louis C.K.]'s uh- car, and [Louis C.K.] rolls the window up.

And uh- ya know, the [WIND] right now is [distracting] me, and that's why I'm sorta 
confined to a certain area where I don't typically talk out loud.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:25:51","00:26:09", @'
:But uh- ya know, the [distraction] in that scene, is, uh-
"Give me back my [jacket]", "I want my [jacket] back"...

And it caused the, the dude that he was worried about having a [conversation] with, to
like, [lose his footing], sort of be like "What the hell...?"
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:26:09","00:26:17", @'
:So like, the roles reverse, he's like:
[Some guy]: Wow, this dude's like [psycho] or somethin'...
            ...he's tellin' me he wants his [jacket] back...?
            What the hell...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:26:17","00:26:29", @'
:And then so like, the dude who like [originally] got out of his car, and started like,
like, uh- gettin' pissed at [Louis C.K.], he's like:
[Some guy]: What the fuck is up with this dude...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:26:29","00:26:40", @'
:And then like, [it works].
[It really does].

It's something that people can use in [real life], for a [varying degree of things].

Right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:26:40","00:27:07", @'
:Ya know, uh- 
I was gonna make another joke about [Andrew Cuomo], but I think I've made enough
jokes about him, I was gonna say, if he wants to like [distract], like, some [girls]
or somethin', he could like, [try to whip his dick out].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:27:07","00:27:14", @'
:Right...?

And then uh- the girls will be like:
[Girls]: Na na na, I'm- we're all set.
         Thanks, though.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:27:14","00:27:28", @'
:And then uh- [Andrew Cuomo] will be like:
[A.C.] : You sure...?
         Sure about that...?
         I mean, fuckin'... [look at this thing]...

And then the girls will be like:
[Girls]: Na na na, don't wanna look at it.
         Ya know...?
         It's fuckin'...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:27:28","00:28:07", @'
:This happened to him about [(11) times]. Ya know...?

[Louis C.K.], he had a situation where he was, about to release his [movie], uh-
I forget what it was called, I think it was "I Love You, Daddy"...?

Uh- and uh, ya know, he's the [director], he's a good [director], and uh- 
somebody decided to like, take a huge dump, all over what he had planned...

And they talked about how like, he was like crankin' on his pud, around a couple of uh-
female colleagues.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:28:07","00:28:24", @'
:Ya know, no- nobody... said nobody-
nothin' to nobody, like up until that movie was about to be released...?

And then [Louis C.K.] sorta lost out, big time.
And uh- that's a tragedy, cause I don't like...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:28:24","00:28:43", @'
:I've made many comparisons between [Louis C.K.] and [Andrew Cuomo], before.
Right...

[Andrew Cuomo]...? [He is not gonna admit a god damn thing], because..
[that's what politicians do]...? 

Or at least what they tend to do...?
It's not a consistent case...?
Right...? But like...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:28:43","00:28:58", @'
:Ya know, [Louis C.K.], he's like 
[Louis C.K.]: Yeah, I did.
              Ya know, I'm not gonna like, [lie] about what happened...
              Ya know, I asked they were like "Sure, ok..."

Right...?

At least in HIS case...?
They [facetiously] or [sarcastically] said [ok], and then [he just did it].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:28:58","00:29:16", @'
:In [Andrew Cuomo]'s case, it was a [flat-out] fuckin' "No, dude... All set."
[(11) girls]. They all said "No."

And uh, somehow, ya know, he just [kept doin' it], he's Like:
[A.C.]: Well, fuckin' try as I might...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:29:16","00:29:44", @'
:But anyway, uh- that's [another strategy], sorta like [bringing back], uh- [bullet points]
from the past that I've, like, [written about], uh- [written material], that's pretty good...

[Material] that I've [written], sometimes when I [write] about something a [number of times],
I will remember it...? It'll make it easier for me to [remember all the details], sorta like
I just did...?

I rattled off that story.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:29:44","00:30:14", @'
:You'll never catch uh- a guy like [George Pataki], gettin' caught in a situation like that.
Not at all. 

Uh- nah, [George Pataki] was the governor like the entire time that I went to
[Shenendehowa School District], and it's like uh- 

Or no, I think it was like (1992), to (2006)...

Yeah and then [Eliot Spitzer] became the governor.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:30:14","00:31:00", @'
:Anyway, uh- what else could I use, what other [strategies] could I use...
It is sorta windy right now, I could talk about the [weather]...

I could talk about [global warming]...
I could talk about [(250) mile tornado tracks]... [record].

[F4 tornado] leavin' behind a [(253) mile tornado track], or maybe, uh- it might've been
more or less... [(250) miles] for a tornado to go is [pretty staggering], and then also...
 
You've got these [hurricanes] that are showin' up and then you've got the, the [floods] 
goin' on over... uh- down south, and then you have like uh- the uh-
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:31:00","00:31:29", @'
:There really is a shit show, when it comes to the weather, and uh-
[climate change] is [definitely real], but- like, part of what the [news] DOES...?

Is like, they basically do the same thing as someone who [sits in a room] and [farts]
all the time, and just [sprays potpourri] or like [air freshener].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:31:29","00:31:46", @'
:Like: 
[News]: Oh wow, oh no.
        Nobody's fartin' in here, smells like [vanilla].
        Or uh- ya know, [tropical flowers], or [blossoms].
        Ya know...?
        There is [nothing disgusting smelling in here].
        Not at all.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:31:46","00:32:01", @'
:And that is sort of like, the reason why [global warming] is as bad as it is.

I'm using a [metaphor] right there, I'm using [literary devices]. 

Ya know, a lot of people, they will assume that like, what I'm sayin' is babbledy-gook.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:32:01","00:32:34", @'
:Right...?
In many cases, some people will do that.

They will say:
[People]: What that dude is sayin'...?
          Is fuckin' babbledy-fuckin'-gook.

          He is makin' NO fuckin' sense, whatsoever.

          He's talkin' about like, the news...?
          Basically like, sittin' in a room...?
          And, chain fartin'...?

          And then like, every time they rip a fuckin' smelly-ass fart...?

          They gotta like, [spray the air freshener].

          That's...
          That's what he's sayin'...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:32:34","00:32:53", @'
:Of course, some people will take what I'm saying a little too [literally]...
which is why there are [lit-er-ar-y de-vi-ces].

[Literary devices] are like uh- [metaphors] or [similies], ya know, using 
[like] or [as]...? [Metaphors]...? 
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:32:53","00:33:20", @'
:Uh- and then uh- also, like [hyperbole]...?
Basically an [exaggeration] of what's going on...?

So like, there might've been about (10) people, like, at a store that I was just at...?

But the [way] that they were like, like, frantically looking for the things they were
trying to buy...? They were- it- they- it act- it almost felt like there were about 
(100) of em, in there.

Right...?
So, that's an exaggeration...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:33:20","00:33:54", @'
:But then there's also, it works in the other way, where like uh- [Louis C.K.] also, 
he's says like uh, ya know, uh- most of the people in the world, probably sucked a dick
at some point...?

Ya know...?
Like, basically half the population sucks, like, sucks a dick (cause they're females), 
sucks dick... and then uh- ya know...?

And then there's guys that are FORCED to suck a dick... 
Right...? 

And then, uh- ya know...? 
There's gotta be like (10) of us out there, somewhere, that have never sucked a dick before.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:33:54","00:34:27", @'
:Right...? So like, there's [(7.5) billion] people on the planet, or, maybe more or less.

I can't remember the exact number, but- ya know, uh- it works in the other way, where
you're making [sheer exaggeration], that's a [hyperbole], but- instead of uh- making
something sound MORE [intense], you make it seem much more [minuscule], and then uh-
it's the [same technique], but...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:34:27","00:34:41", @'
:Typically when people say [exaggerations], they're not thinking like uh- like turning
(1) into (10)... Uh- they're thinking (1) into (10), not like (10) into (1).
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:34:41","00:35:00", @'
:Though, it's not a consistent case.

Uhm, and then also, uh- [another strategy] would be, umh, well [observations] are f- a 
[strategic], uh- [pretty strategic choice]. 
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:35:00","00:35:29", @'
:So right now, like, I'm at a plaza.

I see some girl walking out to her vehicle.
She's... gettin' in a red truck.

She opened the door...?
She's sittin' down...?
She is... uh- put her bag down...?

She just shut the door...?

Uh- now she's gonna start her truck.
She's startin' the truck...?
Uh- it started~!

I can hear it...
She is probably lookin' at her phone real quick, before she takes off...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:35:29","00:35:41", @'
:And uh- ya know...?
What the hell...?

Uh- she's puttin' her seatbelt on...
Uh- she's... puttin' her seatbelt on after adjusting her glasses...?
Right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:35:41","00:35:57", @'
:And uh...
Uh- there's another car comin'...

It's passin' the girl in the truck.
It's uh- [Acura]. SUV. MDX.

I'm not gonna read off the [license plate].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:35:57","00:36:18", @'
:Uh- that, uh- [Acura] is taking a [left] out of the plaza.

The girl in the truck, has not gone anywhere yet.
She's fixin' her hair...

Uh- some older lady came out, she's gettin' into her (4) door [Honda Civic]...?

(2) other ladies comin' out from the other side of the plaza...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:36:18","00:36:41", @'
:Uh, te girl in the red truck hasn't gone anywhere...?
The lady with the [Civic], she just shut her door...?

She is... sorta doin' the [same maneuver] that the girl in the truck was doin' where
she's puttin' her seatbelt on, and adjusted, ready to leave...?

Uh- some dude walked out, of the other side of the plaza.
He's gettin' in HIS car, it's like a white uh, like [Subaru] somethin'.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:36:41","00:37:00", @'
:Or maybe it's...?
I dunno.

The (2) ladies are walkin' to another store, they're not leavin'.

The red- the girl in the red truck, she's got a cigarette, she's opened her window a
little bit...? She's lighting her cigarette, and the other lady in the blue civic, she
is puttin' her seatbelt on...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:37:00","00:37:40", @'
:And, uh- Uh- girl in the red truck...? She is drivin' off, now...
She has no fuckin' clue, that I just narrated everything that she did.

That's ok.
Ya know...?

The dude in the white- [Toyota] somethin', he's pullin' out at the same time as this
lady in the blue [Civic], and the lady in the blue [Civic], she is just bein' very attentive
to detail...?

Red truck just turned right out of the plaza...?

Uh- the [Civic], the lady in the [Civic], she's drivin' like a grandma...?

And, the dude in the [Toyota RAV4]... the white [Toyota RAV4], he's...
They're basically goin' the [same direction].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:37:40","00:37:58", @'
:I don't think that they're together, but they're both turnin' right, basically.

There was a r- there was a black car that pulled into the plaza as I was narrating
all that, the blue [Civic] and the white [Toyota]...?

They're gone now.
They [turned right] out of the plaza.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:37:58","00:38:13", @'
:And then, there's like a dark blue uh- [Chevy] somethin'.

[Chevy Aveo], or whatever.
And it's- another [older lady].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:38:13","00:38:26", @'
:She's got a hat on...?
It looks like a top-hat...?

It looks like an [Englishman top-hat].
Like, what [Charlie Chaplin] would wear.
And, uh...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:38:26","00:38:49", @'
:Ya know, she's like [waddling] to the other side of the plaza...?
She... is walking into a store...?

And [short people], they look a lot like they're [waddling] when they [walk]...?
Cause they have to like, I dunno.

I think of like, how they're [gnomes].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:38:49","00:39:00", @'
:See, there's nobody like within eye- uh- there's nobody that I can see who's like 
walking around right now, or drivin' around in the plaza...?

There's a bunch of cars drivin' around on [Route 9], but-
Ya know, uh...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:39:00","00:39:16", @'
:It's [too many details] for me to be able to [narrate], and, further to that point, Uh-
if I don't make what I'm doing, [sounding interesting], see, I'm sorta like, getting
into the [swing of things here], uh- if uh-
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:39:16","00:39:37", @'
:If I don't [capitalize] on something that is [interesting] to tell...?

Or, there might be something that [isn't very interesting] at all, but the way I'm saying
what is happening, causes it to be [interesting]...

It might cause people to be [LESS interested] in some story going on [ELSEWHERE]...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:39:37","00:39:55", @'
:And then like, they're payin' attention to [my story].
They're like:
[People]: Wait a minute, this fuckin' dude...
          He's just [narrating] shit...?
          And like, talking about stuff like [literary devices], and like [comedians]
          sayin' stuff, and uh- [Andrew Cuomo] bein' a [sausage wrecker]...?
          And uh...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:39:55","00:40:07", @'
:Like, uh- I'm [recapping] and [reviewing] all of the things that I've talked about, like, 
what do I wanna talk about...?

What could be the [most interesting story] that I could tell right now...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:40:07","00:40:31", @'
:So, I could [backpedal] into like uh- the points that I wanted to make earlier, about [bias].
Right...?

Uhm, I do have a sense of [bias], I think [everybody does].
I think it's unavoidable that everybody has a sense of bias.

Nobody wants to talk around in their [underwear], with like, ya know, uh-
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:40:31","00:40:49", @'
:Some dude just got out of his [minivan], and he's walkin' into a store.

I just [inserted] that [observation] into uh- the [middle of a statement] that I was about
to make about [bias]. Uh- a girl, a lady walked out of the same, uh- minivan.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:40:49","00:41:15", @'
:They're goin'- she's goin' to the [same place].
And I think... ya know...?

Uh- some- some girl is leaving another place, and...
She has a child. A girl, they're getting in- no, they're [walking] to the SUV that I've been
[standing near recording], so I'm not gonna be [rude].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:41:15","00:41:45", @'
:I'm not gonna [narrate] what they're doin'... 
Ya know, [narration] has a- there is a bit of a [rude] aspect to, like, [narrating] what
[people] are [doing].

Right...?
So, rather than to be [openly] or [blatantly rude], take a step back, step behind the pylon...
and then like, kinda peer around the corner almost like I'm tryin' to hide...

Well, I am tryin' to hide, while I'm [narrating] what they're doin'.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:41:45","00:42:16", @'
:Uh- a sense of bias.
So like...

I did mention that it is [pretty windy]...?
It is sorta cold...?

But- ya know, like, my [sense of bias] is gonna be a [natural thing], to where, uh-
I would [prefer] that the [environment] be a little [warmer] than it is, and not so [windy].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:42:16","00:42:28", @'
:Cause then I would have [more liberties] to like, [go around and doing stuff], instead of
like, [standing behind this pylon], while like, people are getting in and out of their vehicles.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:42:28","00:42:40", @'
:So, uh...
Sometimes when I'm [writing documents]...?

I have to like, [overlap] certain things.
Or, [embed] them within each other.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:42:40","00:43:16", @'
:And uh- [one thing] that I noticed when I was [performing] like, [transcriptions] and stuff...

Is like, when [people] are having a [conversation], and like, what they're saying is
[interfering] with what the other person is saying...?

Sometimes, it seems like the [words] get [tossed around].

Or like, the [voice] or the [sounds], they sorta like [blend together]...?

And like, even though the people, when they're [talking in person], it makes [total sense]...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:43:16","00:43:51", @'
:Uh, when you [listen] to the [audio recording], sometimes it is [absolutely impossible], or 
[damn near impossible] to make out what the hell [somebody] is [saying].

And uh, ya know when, when listening to an [audio transcription] for the first time...?

Uh- you're gonna have a really [rough idea] of what [words] are being [stated]...?

And, then, then once you have the [initial transcription] figured out...?

Then you're gonna realize when and where [certain words] didn't make it into the 
[transcription], so you add em and tweak em like I do...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:43:51","00:44:06", @'
:But then also, like if you wanna add some [styling] like I do, I [format] like, the things
that I [write] uh- I use the [square brackets], and then I also use the- the [bold]...?

Right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:44:06","00:44:27", @'
:I've used a [varying degree] of uh, fonts, and uh [programs], and uh [methods]...? 
Right...?

I could've like, used [PowerPoint], to like, tell a story about a [(1000) different ways] till
Sunday, or I could've gone to like, [Premiere Pro], I could've edited a whole bunch of scenes,
I could've used [OpenShot]...?

Or whatever...?

Right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:44:27","00:45:03", @'
:But, out of all those programs, I think the [best way] to tell a [story]...
Well, it's my [opinion], it's like, uh [live].

Ya know...?
It's- what I'm [focusing] on right now, is a [live presentation].

Ya know, when the people listen to what I'm doing right now, it's not gonna be live...?

But- ya know, I could [very easily] go in front of a [group of people], that know what,
what I'm gonna- that- that [predict some of my behaviors], or things I'm gonna [talk about],
and then like, basically do the [same thing] that I'm doing [right now].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:45:03","00:45:32", @'

for something that is [totally unexpected] or [unscheduled]. And, I don't like the idea of
[scheduling things].

Mainly because, if I had to [schedule] what I'm doing right now...?

It would take on a [different feeling] and then it would feel more [forced] and [coerced],
rather than to be [free-flowing] and [dynamic], like it is right now.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:45:32","00:46:05", @'

And, something like this, is gonna [catch a lot of people by surprise].

Because a lot of people aren't gonna to [understand] what the hell I'm saying, even though
they can hear me saying the words and the words sound, like, ya know...

They're not like uh- it's not like I'm talking about [dragons flying around in the sky],
and the sky is like, [turning a bunch of different colors], and then you got [leprechauns]

Nah, it's- eh- THOSE are [delusions].

But- ya know, given enough like, [expansion] of those [details] and stuff, it could be that
someone is using a [metaphor], and someone is [not paying close enough attention to that].

:But- ya know, do I think that like, most uh [reporters] or uh, [TV anchors], do I think that
they [do their own writing]...? I dunno. [I really don't think that they do]... 

I think like, they [read] a [teleprompter], and [somebody prepared] what goes into that
teleprompter [ahead of time], and, they have an idea for like, how much [time] they have...?

How long it's gonna take for them to [talk] about the [particular subject]...?

So the [teleprompter] is only gonna have a [certain maximum word limit]...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:49:21","00:49:45", @'
:And, sometimes the [anchors], they don't know how to [pronounce] certain words...?

([Guiliana Bruno] from WTEN was attempting to pronounce a [medication name], and she
literally said "Uh, what...?", but this is pretty rare.)

So like, uh- being considerate of all those things, um...
Being an [anchor] on a, [news station], is a bit of a [choreographed] uh- situation...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:49:45","00:50:01", @'
:Whereas what I'm doing is [a lot harder to do]... [without question]...

What I'm doing is [a lot more difficult to do], than [what they do]...

But that doesn't mean that what they do isn't difficult, cause it is...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:50:01","00:50:23", @'
:It has to be [syncopated]...?
It has to be in [rhythm]...?
It has to be, uh- [short] and to the [point]...?

Because most people are gonna have a hard time wrapping their heads around like, 
a lot of [rich content].

But- ya know, that varies.
Depends on what the [content] is.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:50:23","00:50:59", @'
:So when I ask the question like uh- what do I wanna talk about, or uh- if I say, even
me, I convey a [sense of bias] to [some degree], with uh- the things that I will... 

Like, I can say for certain that [this particular audio recording]...?

Uh, I'm gonna go and make it [publicly available], because I've gotten to the point where
I'm [a lot more comfortable], uh- with the things that I'm talking about. 

And, though I am still [improvising] to a large extent...?

I've talked about a number of, [constructive things] so far.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:50:59","00:51:20", @'
:And most notably, like uh- [strategies].

And, [one strategy] that I uh- wanted to- to, get around to, is this, right...?

Uhm, when I'm [programming], when I'm sittin' in front of the computer screen and I'm
like, actually [programming] something...? 
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:51:20","00:51:47", @'
:Uh- I think about the [number of ways to dissect], uh the [properties], or the [task at hand],
and I [stick with the rather simple building blocks]. 

I don't uh- try to get- there are [some cases] where I'll go to [extreme lengths] to make
things that are [pretty complicated], but I've gotten to the point where I can [dissect] the
idea of what I wanna build, pretty easily...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:51:47","00:52:07", @'
:And then have a way to [showcase] it pretty easily, too.

And then like, ya know, I've written a [fair amount of programming] already, so like, 
I will know:
[Me]: Ok, in the [one function] I wrote, I did this...?
      I'd like to [copy] and [paste] it, but I ALSO wanna like, [rebuild it] from the ground up.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:52:07","00:52:37", @'
:And so, that's what I'll do. 

I'll uh- [rebuild something from the ground up], and I'll just continue to go at the same
thing that I did already, right...?

Not to the degree where I'm spending like, like [weeks] or [months], uh [building] something...
But- to the degree where, uh- I'll [start to refine the edges a little bit more].

Or I'll [sand the edges down].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:52:37","00:53:25", @'
:And, instead of it being a [harsh 90 degree corner], [right angle]...?
It'll be a [smooth beveled surface], ya know...? Like a [curve].

So, when I used to build maps for [Quake III Arena], one uh- relatively new concept was uh-
[curves]. So, prior to [Quake III Arena], in order to make [curves], you had to like, chisel
out like, [brushes].

And, you know, if you wanted to make like a [beveled surface]...?
You'd have to- like you- you'd have to uh- I dunno, I'll have to [expand] upon this concept
a bit more, but- 
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:53:25","00:54:16", @'
:Uh, [Quake III Arena] and [Doom], well, [Quake] and [Doom], the way that they calculated like,
the [space of a room], or the [area] of uh, or was uh- considered the [playable area]...?

Uh- it had to use a number of [techniques] that like, divided the [non-playable area], from
the [playable area], and then like, whatever the [geometry] was...? Uh- it would have to break 
everything down to [triangles].

And, when [Quake III Arena] came out, it took the idea of brushes, and then it inserted this
idea of like, [curves], to where the [curves] could be like uh- [generated by the hardware].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:54:16","00:55:15", @'
:And then it would be able to [dynamically adjust], whether or not the [curve] was [complex] or
[simple]. And, uh- another term for this is basically the uh- [draw distance].

So like, uhm, if I'm like, compared to real life, right, uh- 

If I'm walking down the road, and I see like, the [golden arches] for [McDonalds] like (3)
miles away down the road...? 

Well, chances are that I could get away with using some really cheap uh, [geometry] to reflect
that. You don't want it to look like, awful, but you're not anywhere near the [golden arches]
to be able to determine whether that thing has like [thousands of polygons], or just like a 
[handful].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:55:15","00:55:30", @'
:Whereas uh, you know, if you're like- you know, about like, a [quarter mile away] from the
[golden arches]...? You're gonna be able to see [a lot more detail].

And then once you get like, about [(10) feet] to the damn sign...?
Then, you're gonna see a [HELL of a lot more detail].

Then you're really gonna wa- probably not gonna wanna use [thousands] of uh, [triangles], or
uh [polygons], but- ya know, uh- these are the things that uh- [tessellation] addresses.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:55:30","00:56:22", @'
:[Tessellation] uh- is something that- I don't know if [Nvidia] pioneered [tessellation], but- uh,
it's a pretty cool idea, is this uh- [graphics demonstration], I think it was [Heaven]...?

It might've been uh- called something else, I can't remember exactly.
([Unigine Heaven], with the dragon. It's not a [game], its a [benchmark utility].)

But, it's like uh- you could turn the [tessellation] on...?
And, the higher the [tessellation], the more [polygons] it would draw...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:56:22","00:56:47", @'
:So like, the [programming] for the [game] hadn't changed at all, but the [level of detail] uh
was [raised immensely]. And that's what LOD stands for, LOD bias or uh, [distance]... these
are all like, uh- [property] or uh something terms...? 

Right, and...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:56:47","00:57:16", @'
:Running something through like, a [game engine], uh everything has [properties], right...?

So like, the [game engine] has to load a whole bunch of [details], not unlike how uh...

When I start to [play music], or I start to like, uh- rattle off one of these [lectures],
I'm talking about a bunch of, like, [details].

So, [asset management]. 
And [asset management] comes down to like, [documentation].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:57:16","00:57:32", @'
:And, uh [recording myself], and knowing how to [present] it, and...
being able to make it [consumable], and making sure that people [understand] it.

And uh- the things that seem rather [simple] and [intuitive]...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:57:32","00:58:11", @'
:Like in the real world...?

You find out pretty quickly, that even something as simple as what I'm doing right now,
it isn't that simple, but further to that point... uh-

[A lot of people take things for granted].

So what I mean is this, like I have put a lot of [effort] into trying to like uh...
[Shape my voice], and my [narrative], when making these things...?

Right, so like, there's a lady in a SUV, it's a [Honda SUV]...?

She's pullin' up to the, the parking spot...?
She just stopped.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:58:11","00:58:27", @'
:Uh- no, she's rollin' up a lil b-
Uh- now she stopped.

Alright...?
She's lookin' left...?
She's lookin' right...?

She is making sure her jacket's zipped up all the way...?
And, she's about to get out...?
Uh- somebody in a truck just drove up...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:58:27","00:58:45", @'
:See, what I'm doing right now, is I'm using a [distraction technique].
But I'm also, like, using [observations], right...?

So, in a [conversation] that I would be having with somebody, I could use one of these
[distraction techniques], if I want to [distract] from uh, the point that I was just about
to make.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:58:45","00:59:09", @'
:But- the point that I was about to make, is gonna be [harder] for me to reach, unless...
Uh- I can remember walking down a path, or where my por- [point of origin] was. 

And so, with [most people], they're not go- they're gonna have a really rough time, being
able to [comprehend] all the things that I stated so far in this [audio recording]...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:59:09","00:59:30", @'
:[Hearing it], they'll [understand] it just fine.
But [comprehending] it, is a [different thing].

You can [hear] somebody talk, you can [listen] to somebody talk, you can [hear] them talk,
but to [comprehend] it, requires being able to like, uh- [understand] what was stated, and
then [repeat it back].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:59:30","01:00:00", @'
:And [comprehension] is, fucking difficult. Lemme tell ya.
Because, ya know, most people, like, go on [autopilot], right...?

So like I'm- I haven't been- like, on [autopilot] at all in this entire uh, [recording].

Like I'm- I would say it sorta falls in line with [performance acting], but I'm not [acting].

I'm- [being myself].
So, it's more like, [performance profession].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:00:00","01:00:21", @'
:Right...?
Dude in his [Range Rover]...? [Gray Range Rover] just pulled up.
He's got his (sun)glasses on, and his winter hat.

He just turned his, [Range Rover] off...?
And, ya know...?

[He looks like a cool dude].
With his [glasses] on.
And, those are [observation techniques].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:00:21","01:00:53", @'
:And then, it's another [distraction]...?
It's another [strategy].

Uh- really, the [beginning] and the [end] of this whole [lecture] comes down to, telling an
[interesting story] and then like, [knowing what to say], to cause the story to BE
[interesting]...

...they're [(2) totally different subjects], and I have to tape em together as I'm making
these things, because it's not really all that [intuitive].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:00:53","01:01:24", @'
:And uh- few people are gonna be able to [appreciate] somethin' like this.

Ya know, maybe like [hundreds of years] in the future...?
People will like, listen to some of my [audio recordings], and they'll be like:
[People]: Wow, this dude...?
          Ya know...?
          He is like a- he was like the [Shakespeare] of ya know, (2000). (23).
          How did he not get [standing ovations] like, every time that he hit the record 
          button...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:01:24","01:02:10", @'
:Well, I can tell ya, it's because uh- the way our [society] is [shaped] now, is sort of like,
[on demand]. 

Ya know like, when people watch [prime time television], they're like:
[People]: Well, we'll put [prime time television] on because like, most people work like (9-5).

          And then when they get outta work, they wanna like, [watch the news].

          Some people work (8-4) though, [Michael Cook].
          So, we'll have like an [hour long session of news]...?
          
          And then we'll have [ANOTHER hour long session of news] that's sorta like covers
          the same topics that they just covered... the [last hour]...?
          
          And then while people are like, watchin' the news...?
          They'll be able to like, [cook themselves dinner and shit].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:02:10","01:02:27", @'
:And that's basically what the [news companies] do.
Ya know...?

It's what they do.

Most people in society, they work (9-5), because, [that is when people feel like doin' shit].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:02:27","01:02:54", @'
:Ya know, what if [everybody] worked at night...?

Nah, that's fuckin' stupid, cause ya know, the [circadian rhythm], [Michael Cook].

You wanna talk about your [circadian rhythm], you don't wanna [fight] the urge to wanna
[fall asleep], because if you do...? 

Then you might be awake all night. 
And you don't want that...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:02:54","01:03:16", @'
:Not if you want to be able to, uh- have a uh- have a [healthy routine]...?
Or a [healthy lifestyle] or whatever...?

You wanna make damn certain that you're [well-rested], in order to [comprehend] stuff...?
And that, uh-
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:03:16","01:03:35", @'
:Yeah, there's a lot goin' on right now, looks like the guy in his [Range Rover] is takin' off.
There's a guy like, talkin to some girl...?

Have- having a bag...?
And, uh- he's got a red car...?
And then some third dude got into another [SUV]...?

A fuckin' [Subaru] or whatever...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:03:35","01:04:03", @'
:Dude in the [Range Rover], he stopped.

He's like "What the hell...?"

But uh- yeah, how do I tell, these- these details that I'm rattling off, what the hell
do they mean for anybody else...?

And so like, it all comes down to like, the [presentation].
Right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:04:03","01:04:24", @'
:The [presentation], is something that [few people] are gonna be able to [appreciate], because...
Uh- if they wanna [learn something] from some of my [observation skills], they're gonna have
a [fun time] doing it.

They're gonna like, [learn some cool shit], and then they're also gonna like, 
[see some cool shit], too...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:04:24","01:04:43", @'
:They're gonna be like:
[Them]: Wow.
        That fuckin' [Michael Cook] dude worked really hard, to like, be a cut above the rest.

But the problem is like, most people, they're [not gonna appreciate] what I'm doing, unless
they [know] what the hell I'm tryin' to do.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:04:43","01:04:59", @'
:Whereas, someone like [George Carlin], he spent years doin' this.
I- I would imagine...

I would imagine, like, he probably had a [tape recorder].
And then he [listened] to himself [all the time], he's like:
[Carlin]: You know what, dude...?
          I'm gonna buy a tape...?
          And then [record myself] just talkin' about a [whole bunch of shit] that wrote about...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:04:59","01:05:24", @'
:And then, ya know, at some point...?

He started to like, uh- [get in front of people], talking about those things that he 
[wrote about], and [recorded]...? And then, eventually [things took off].

But- I gotta say, it probably took [a lot of fucking work]. 
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:05:24","01:05:51", @'
:Whereas like, uhm...

Let me go out on a limb here, and say that guys like [Bill Burr], or uh- [Louis C.K.]...?

Uh- they probably too, [have done this same thing], right...?

And like, what the hell was it that caused [Bill Burr] to go from being this relatively
unknown person, to like [suddenly being the one of the best names in comedy]...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:05:51","01:06:17", @'
:Well, I think is [appearance] on [Breaking Bad], was uh- definitely uh- helpful...
Right...?

Playing [Kubee] on [Breaking Bad]...? It's like:
[Somebody]     : Wow, that dude that played the fuckin' [Huell]'s like, sidekick...?
                 In [Breaking Bad]...?
                 He's a fuckin' comedian...?
[Someone Else] : Yeah, he's a fuckin' really GOOD comedian, too.
                 Talks about smashin' muffins, and shit.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:06:17","01:06:39", @'
:Smashin' the muffins...?
Right...?

He asks himself the same sorts of [questions] that like [Louis C.K.] and [George Carlin] do.

He's like:
[Burr] : How many muffins, could I [destroy], before anybody did anything about it...?
         Ya know...?
         If I destroy (1) muffin, will the lady like, freak out and be like:
         "What the hell did you do THAT, for...?"
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:06:39","01:06:48", @'
:And then like, 
Ya know, that's- that's sort of a question that I ask myself.

Was like, inter- [interjecting into his joke], and [expanding upon it].
Or [extending] it, right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:06:48","01:07:06", @'
:[Me]   : Well, I just destroyed one of your muffins, lady.

And then the lady would be like:
[Lady] : Well, what the fuck...
         Why would you DO that...?

And then I would be Like:
[Me]   : Well, just to see what you would do.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:07:06","01:07:33", @'
:And so what I'm doing, is I'm sorta [slowing down] the [whole scene] in my head.

It's making the whole situation seem rather [unrealistic], but- 
Ya know, it's making it [comedic].

[Slowing down a situation] is a [tactic] that I have learned to use, to describe the 
[innate nature] of something, right...?

So, if uh- if you start havin' a conversation with this uh- this muffin lady...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:07:33","01:08:34", @'
:Say:
[Me]: You know what...?
      I destroyed one of your muffins, because I just felt like it.
      I wanted to see what you would do.

And then the lady would be like:
[Lady]: Well that's- rather rude of you.
        Do you know how long I take, to make these fucking muffins, buddy...?

And then I would say:
[Me]: I dunno.
      How long do you take to make those muffins...?

And the lady will be like, put her hand on her hip and be like:
[Lady]: I fuckin' slave over the stove, to make these god damn muffins...
        ...and you're just gonna walk up, and then smash one of my fuckin' muffins...?
        How dare you...?

And then I would say:
[Me]: Well, what if I smash another one...?
      
And then the lady would be like:
[Lady]: You better not do it...
        Better not do it...

And then I would be like:
[Me]: Well, what are you gonna do if I do do that...?

And then the lady would be like:
[Lady]: Well, ya know I'm gonna be pissed...

And then, I would say:
[Me]: Well, how much more pissed would you be, than you are right now...?
      Twice as pissed...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:08:34","01:08:43", @'

[Lady]: Well, I dunno.
        Maybe not TWICE as pissed, I would just still be the same amount of pissed...
        but just slightly more...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:08:43","01:09:20", @'
:Right...?
So these things all touch on [philosophy].

Am I gonna like [capitalize] on a bit that [Bill Burr] did...?
Well, I have [expanded] upon what made that [skit] as [funny] as it is...

And sort of [coalescing] it into uh- the same sort of conversation that uh-
[Lincoln Osiris] slash [Kirk Lazerus] has with [Tugg Speedman] in, [Tropic Thunder].

He's just a dude, playin' a dude, disguised as another dude.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:09:20","01:09:47", @'

know what dude he is, but claims to know what dude he is, by playing other dudes...?

Because, ya know, the [reality] is this, right...?
Uhm, in [programming]...?
[I'm gonna tie all these things together here], right now.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:09:47","01:10:25", @'
:In [programming], you really have to deal with the concept of [(0), (1), or more than (1)].

So if there is (0) of something...?
Then you're gonna have 'no'.

If you have (1)...? 
Then you have 'an' or 'a'.

If you have more than (1)...?
You're gonna have 'some', or 'many' or 'most'...?

And then, like if you have, like the [maximum number] that you could [possibly have],
of something, you're gonna have 'all'.

Those terms right there, [illuminate] a [spectrum] between like, ya know, uh- [defining]
the [least amount] of things that could be [had]... 

...to the, the [approximate], or uh [sensible amount] of things that could be [had],
[talked about]...

[observed]...

out a bunch of [mathematical operators], with [language].

And, this is how [comedy] gets its' [comedic feel] to it.

It all comes down to [math], and generally speaking, a [punchline] or
something that [makes] something [funny]...?

Is, is, [the amount of time that goes into it].

(Whether that is the amount of time that goes into writing the joke, or delivering
it, OR, the amount of time that passes within the joke. It all applies.)

[You]   : Yeah, I did.
[Person]: No you didn't, you said (1), (2), (99), (100).

[You]   : Nope, I said 'skip a few'... as well.

And the person'll be like:
[Person]: Yeah, but that's not even- that's not a number...
          that's like you're skipping a few.

(3) to (98) is [bypassed].
There's no need to say all that with that [shorthand methodology].

And [programming] works in the same way.
Where like, if you have a [pattern], that can be arrived at...?
With a rather [adamant conclusion]...?

Then you can [aggregate] what the- you can [project] what that [mathematical formula]
might turn out to be, and that's like 'level of detail', and that's also like uh-
[complexity].

[Gumbel]: Ya know, I'm a fuckin'... news like- uh, a [sports news anchor].
          Ya know, serious... as a fuckin' heart attack...
          I'm [Bryant Gumbel]

[Maher]: Well...?
         That's not a bad idea, because, ya know, what if...
         like, ya know, me AND [John Oliver] have the fuckin' the fist bump
         between commercial breaks, like... uh, [Jon Stewart] and uh-
         [Stephen Colbert] had...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:34:53","01:35:29", @'
:And then before you know it, like, [Jon Stewart], er- [John Oliver] has his own show.
[Last Week Tonight] on [HBO].

And then from that point forward, [John Oliver], took things to a totally new level, because
he had a lot more [freedom], with [what he could say]. He didn't have to worry about like, 
[casually uttering off swear words]... while pulling off, like, [one of the most controversial]
ways of [telling the news].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:35:29","01:36:04", @'
:And then you had like [John Oliver], like basically [going around the world], and meeting
guys like [Edward Snowden] over in [Russia].

And then [Edward Snowden] would be like:
[Snowden]: Hey.

And then [John Oliver] would be like:
[Oliver]: Hey.

Then, they would say...
[Oliver]: Ya know, like, what is it that caused you, to wanna leak all of those documents,
          from the [National Security Agency], because, ya know, that was a very ballsy
          move, [Edward Snowden]...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:36:04","01:36:20", @'
:And then [Edward Snowden], he's like:
[Snowden]: Well, ya know, Like uh- I saw you...?
           Like, ya know, on the [Today (Daily) Show],
           and I saw you struggling to make a name for yourself...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:36:20","01:36:58", @'

[Edward Snowden], and then [Edward Snowden]'s like:

[Snowden]: And, uh- what I realized was that, uh- 
           Our freedom's in jeopa-
           Our [freedoms], and [constitutional liberties], and [rights]...?
           [They're in jeopardy].

           And then like, I wanted to make sure that like, the next [John]-
           [John Oliver], would have a way to become [John Oliver], because,
           what I actually saw, was like...

           Some people were like, killing the idea of [comedy], AND, 
           people having, uh- [the ability to speak freely about the world], 
           and what's going on in it...

'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:37:17","01:37:55", @'
:Y- all of these things, like- they're [very important].

Because, heh. 
What it says is that like, uhm, people like [John Oliver] are gonna be- the reason why they
are so [rare], is because of how hard people work against the idea of uh- [comedy].

Or making- [ridiculing], like [people in charge], or people that have a lot of [money], or 
people that have uh- a lot of [credibility], and then they- get their dick sucked by women 
like [Monica Lewinsky], and then they say:
[Clinton]: I never had sexual relations with that woman...?

Fuckin' president like- [avoided being impeached] for like, [lying to people] and like,

So, I'll tell ya, here's what it all comes down to, is this.

though I said that I was gonna end the [audio log], a while ago...?

That was like...

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:39:55","01:40:35", @'
:I dunno, like fuckin' (10) years ago. 
(10) to (15) years ago.

Ya know...?
A lot has changed in the last (10-15) years, but what I can say, is that...
Over the last (10) to (15) years, it went from like... uh...

Being a- the... 
[Today (Daily) Show] and the [Colbert Report] on [Comedy Central], to like, uh...
[John Stewart (Oliver)] on [Last Week Tonight] on [HBO].

And, ya know, talking about like, varying degrees of like, uh...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:40:35","01:40:51", @'

And like, it all boil- like si- simply put, uh- basically [every single story], or seemingly
[every single story] that, uh- [John Oliver] talks about on [Last Week Tonight]...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:40:51","01:41:14", @'
:Has to do, with... some people doin' some [real evil shit].
And, a lot of times, it boils right down to [money].

But- ya know, what causes it to be such an [evil thing], is the fact that...
[A lot of people just continue to let this shit happen]...
...and they like, [think that it's normal].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:41:14","01:41:37", @'

He is raking in [a lot of views]...?
A lot of-

He's making a lot of [content]...?
And mainly because he's probably bombarded with [so many examples], of like, cops doing
[stupid fuckin' shit] on like a [daily basis]...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:42:10","01:42:34", @'
:That he's got a full-time job.
[He's never gonna be able to keep up with all it, either].
Nah.

So, that is the reason why I started making this [recording], actually, is because like-
even with uh- the [amount of time] that I have to [focus] on the things that I think are 
most important, like I'm not gonna be able to keep up with [every single story] that I wanna
keep up with.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:42:34","01:42:54", @'

Whether, uh- like, it's a good [sense of bias] or not...?

Ya know, I think it really depends on like, who is, [who] is able to [make that judgement]...?
Or whatever...?
Right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:42:54","01:43:10", @'
:[Bias] can be [good] or [bad], but typically, uhm, when [bias] is the same- like, resorts to

Or...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:43:10","01:43:27", @'

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:43:27","01:44:14", @'
:What is it that REALLY got [Julien Assange] thrown in prison...?

Well, I will tell you, uh-

I think that what really got [Julien Assange] thrown in prison...
Are a [bunch of fuckin' morons] that have [control of society]...

And, they have like, caused [so many people] in society to become like, [numb] and like, uh-
[indifferent] to the amount, or [varying degrees of control] that [certain people] have.

And this [level of control is rather hidden], right...?
It's like...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:44:14","01:44:36", @'
:Uh- it's [caused by people being in denial], but further to that point...

It's ALSO caused by like, just people [expecting] things to be, ya know, like the same
thing as they were. So like, take this into consideration...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:44:36","01:44:46", @'
:A lot of people, they go and [watch movies] at the [movie theater] and stuff, right...?
And then they'll see like a [brand-new movie]...?

They'll be like "Oh, that movie is really cool..."
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:44:46","01:45:05", @'
:Like, when I saw this fuckin' like, uh- [Batman] movie, like uh- last month or whatever, 
uh- [Christopher Nolan]'s [Batman] movies were awesome.

And I think it's gonna be [REALLY DIFFICULT], to pull off a [convincing upgrade] over those
films.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:45:05","01:45:38", @'
:And the reason being, is because [Christopher Nolan] is a fucking [great director].

He was great with [Interstellar], he was great with [Inception], and I'm pretty sure, 
that the dude, [wrote a lot].

Uh- and then like, ya know, [James Cameron].

Is also like a [really good director].
Ya know...?

For what it's worth, like the guys at [Marvel] that take inspiration from [Stan Lee]...?
[Stan Lee] was a great director, too.
Great storyteller.
Ya know...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:45:38","01:46:00", @'
:Uhm, [all these stories] sorta boil down to uh- ya know, there- there's fuckin' [evil] out
there [already], [currently]... You know, talking about the [evil], is, [dangerous], because...

The [evil] will be like "Well, it's just your [opinion] that I'm [evil]..."
And then they'll have you thrown in jail, like [Julien Assange] for (175) years.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:46:00","01:46:16", @'
:Or, they'll just fuckin' put ya on a [blacklist], and then you're not allowed to say
