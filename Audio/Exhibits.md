# Audio (Exhibits/Evidence)

First and foremost...? 

This FIRST entry below is of a rather large significance as it expertly portrays that **many** of the deputies that work for the **Saratoga County Sheriffs Office** are really stupid. For instance, **Jeffrey Margan**, **Paul Pecor**, and **Daniel Nelson**. **Jared Gardner** was ALSO attached to this incident, although he was NOT in the room at the time I recorded this audio recording.

Prior to this particular recording...?

My mother had contacted the **Saratoga County Sheriffs Office**, because she was _upset_ that I was _using the light in the kitchen to eat some ramen_. This was **at or about the time** that **Russia** began to invade **Ukraine**, and I had recorded MULTIPLE VIDEOS of CYBERATTACKS that had taken place against my equipment just DAYS beforehand.

The problem is, these dudes from SCSO are *really stupid*... and it can be heard in the audio recording how stupid they are.

They're never going to AGREE that they're really stupid, but- that's really just **too bad** =`(...<br>
...because here's the **evidence** they were **too lazy** to: **(look at/collect)**, as well as like, a couple of brand new cyberattacks that someone decided to do today **(12/18/22)** as I was intially creating this markdown file.

**Russia** had used _various cyberattacks_ against **Ukraine** at or about that date, and I told these **morons from SCSO** about these following videos:

| Date     | Name/URL                                                                       |

So, for the guys who work at the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office...?<br>
Go ahead, and grab this thing called a "dictionary", before you continue reading this document...

What these _links_ ABOVE are called, "VIDEOS".<br>
Videos are actually pretty <i>cool</i>, and I'll even go so far as to explain the **definition** of that word, for any fuckin' moron from **(SCSO/NYSP)** who doesn't know...

| Word  | Type | Definition                                                       |
|:------|:-----|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| VIDEO | NOUN | the (recording/reproducing/broadcasting) of moving visual images |

When people use this word in this thing called a SENTENCE...

| Word  | Type | Definition                                                       |
|:------|:-----|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| SENTENCE | NOUN | a set of words that is complete in itself, typically containing a subject and predicate, conveying a statement, question, exclamation, or command, and consisting of a main clause and sometimes one or more subordinate clauses. |

...it'll look like this:

"Here's a list of the VIDEOS that I recorded of the CYBERATTACKS that occurred back before RUSSIA invaded UKRAINE, you lazy fucks."

See how that word looks really useful and cool...?<br>
Well, imagine if someone hears about this audio recording, and fires all (3) of you idiots...<br>
To be fair, I think you guys don't have to worry about anything, and that's because the guy who runs SCSO is really fuckin' stupid.

These VIDEOS constitute as EVIDENCE of someone committing CYBERATTACKS against my EQUIPMENT, and I recorded them way back in... "February 2022".<br>
You would have to be one of the dumbest fuckin' people on the planet, to not see that these videos indicate the thing that I talk about with the (3) morons in the audio recording in the link above.

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE~!<br>
AS I WAS UPDATING [[THIS PARTICULAR FILE](https://github.com/mcc85s/FightingEntropy/edit/main/Audio/Exhibits.md)]...?

Uh-oh... someone who's a real dumb motherfucker, thought it'd be a smart idea to commit ANOTHER CYBERATTACK that I managed to catch in (2) fucking videos...

| Date         | Name/URL                                                                |

| **12/18/22** | [Cyberattack/Archimedes Laptop Angle](https://youtu.be/Ct8X356_Xhc)     |

Basically, the CYBERATTACK OCCURRING IN THESE (2) VIDEOS ARE NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE ONES IN THE VIDEO LINKS UP ABOVE~!<br>
HOLY SHIT. **IMAGINE IF THE SARATOGA COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE WASN'T FULL OF CARELESS MORONS~!**

I can't.<br>
I TRY to imagine a world where the SARATOGA COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE has (0) careless morons who work in it...?<br>
But- that is an absolute fucking fantasy.<br>
This place is a fucking joke.<br>
They're not ALONE, however.<br>
Troop G of the New York State Police also has SOME real dumb motherfuckers in their midst, too.<br>
What can anybody actually do about it...?<br>
Keep reading, you'll find out how (1) guy outsmarted a legion of lazy fucks that have:

| Index | Laurel         |
|:------|:---------------|
| 1     | badges         |
| 2     | gavels         |
| 3     | law degree     |
| 4     | medical degree | 
| 5     | masters degree |
| 6     | doctorate/M.D. |
| 7     | etc.           |

At this time, I will commence with the number of **audio recordings** that I've been _collecting_.<br>
This "collection" process is something that the official police are supposed to do from time to time, but I have observed that many of them are just really fucking lazy, and they don't ever do that. Not at all. If they manage to SEE any evidence that makes their life or job a lot more DIFFICULT...? They will aggressively ignore it. Sometimes, they will even perform these **cyberattacks** and use [CVE-2019-8936](https://vuxml.freebsd.org/freebsd/c2576e14-36e2-11e9-9eda-206a8a720317.html) and disrupt a business that I used to manage for over (3) years at [1602 Route 9, Clifton Park, NY 12065](https://www.google.com/maps/@42.8520005,-73.757225,21z).

This collection is far from complete, but it expertly portrays that a number of highly respected people in **Saratoga County** are really fucking **(stupid/lazy)**.

I stated this to Sarah Schellinger, but she's stupid. I also suggested to the receptionist that I wanted to show up in person, but she said that I would have to put the request into writing OR, let my attorney know. I DID let my attorney know, but she was not very helpful. |

If you're not, press 5." I'm just kidding, the voice prompt does not indicate anything like that at all. |

Why...? Because any judge can actually intentionally do their job incorrectly, and then throw the book at any individual, act like a communist party, and disconnect a defendant from their own court appearance, and if they record MISCONDUCT on behalf of the JUDGE...? That's actually ILLEGAL to show other people. So, in reality, judges can literally pull these stupid fucking stunts, so can the people at the court, and the "system" just expedites the process of violating people's rights without worrying about any sort of legal ramifications for doing something really fucking stupid. Oh, by the way, this dipshit ordered me to go to the Saratoga County Jail for about (20) days, and he never mailed me the order to do that. Pretty cool, huh...? This whole (20) days in jail actually SEVERED my business arrangement with Kenneth Yates from the Business Products Company located at 1763 Route 9, Clifton Park, NY 12065. Wicked fuckin' cool, huh...? It's almost as if literally everyone in the world likes the idea of sabotaging my life. That's why I like to show people this particular audio recording in my arsenal of audio recordings that I'll be using to file a lawsuit against Saratoga County. |

She's... literally a moron. I didn't get my shoes back when I went to the hospital back in June 2020. This lady was like "Oh my god, you didn't get your SHOES back...? There MUST be some sort of misunderstanding on YOUR part, we never fail to do our jobs incorrectly here... We would know if we did." Nah. Some people are really stupid. |

It's too bad that my cuntrag neighbor Bill Moak doesn't understand that, and neither does my mother. I literally attempted to show this recording to my mother and Silfredo Vasquez on June 27th, 2022. But- my mother is pretty stupid. |

Then he's like "The video you were recorded doing something you didn't even do, in a video that doesn't even exist. How stupid are YOU, dude...?" |
