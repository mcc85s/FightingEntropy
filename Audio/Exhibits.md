This was at or about the time that Russia began to invade Ukraine. Russia had used various cyberattacks against Ukraine at or about that date. I told Jeffrey Margan, Paul Pecor, and Daniel Nelson that I had these things called VIDEOS of someone committing a CYBERATTACK against my equipment from back in February 2022. Here are the links that these (guys/cops) were *too lazy* to check out back then.<br>2022_0215-(A Matter of National Security) | https://youtu.be/e4VnZObiez8<br>2022_0225-(Censorship on Facebook) | https://youtu.be/Jmq4yBqGhTs<br>2022_0226-(Smartphone-WhileBSOD) | https://youtu.be/40sQXpVh_8Y<br>2022_0226-(Smartphone-Post-BSOD) | https://youtu.be/oShPs6_uXIk<br>2022_0226-(OBS-Laptop-Post-BSOD) | https://youtu.be/LYVUMLpofWg<br>Sorta looks like I've got some stuff for people who call themselves POLICE OFFICERS to look at, right...? Think again. They STILL won't look at it. That's how stupid these guys are. Cool huh...? You people are pretty stupid.<br>https://youtu.be/fIuB2TbOInc [Smartphone Angle]|<br>https://youtu.be/Ct8X356_Xhc [Laptop Angle]
