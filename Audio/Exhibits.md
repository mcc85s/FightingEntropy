In this particular recording, my mother had contacted the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office because she was upset that I was using the light in the kitchen to eat some ramen. This was at or about the time that Russia began to invade Ukraine, and I had recorded MULTIPLE VIDEOS of CYBERATTACKS that had taken place against my equipment just DAYS beforehand. The problem is that these dudes from SCSO are *really stupid*...

Russia had used various cyberattacks against Ukraine at or about that date, and I told these morons from SCSO about these following videos...

What these links above are called, are "VIDEOS" which constitutes as "evidence" of someone committing MULTIPLE CYBERATTACKS against my equipment, from back in February 2022. You would have to be really fucking stupid, to not see what these videos indicate. But also, AS I WAS UPDATING THIS PARTICULAR FILE...?

Uh-oh... someone thought it'd be a smart idea to commit ANOTHER CYBERATTACK...
