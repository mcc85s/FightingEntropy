# Audio Exhibits (Same thing as "evidence")

First and foremost...? This entry below is of a rather large significance as it expertly portrays that many of the deputies that work for the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office are really stupid. For instance, Jeffrey Margan, Paul Pecor, and Daniel Nelson. Jared Gardner was also attached to this incident, although he was NOT in the room at the time I recorded this audio recording.

Prior to this particular recording, my mother had contacted the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office because she was upset that I was using the light in the kitchen to eat some ramen. This was at or about the time that Russia began to invade Ukraine, and I had recorded MULTIPLE VIDEOS of CYBERATTACKS that had taken place against my equipment just DAYS beforehand. The problem is that these dudes from SCSO are *really stupid*...

Russia had used various cyberattacks against Ukraine at or about that date, and I told these morons from SCSO about these following videos...

What these links above are called, are "VIDEOS" which constitutes as "evidence" of someone committing MULTIPLE CYBERATTACKS against my equipment, from back in February 2022. You would have to be really fucking stupid, to not see what these videos indicate. But also, AS I WAS UPDATING THIS PARTICULAR FILE...?

Uh-oh... someone thought it'd be a smart idea to commit ANOTHER CYBERATTACK...

At this time, I will commence with the number of audio recordings that I've been collecting. This collection is far from complete, but it expertly portrays that a number of highly respected people in Saratoga County are really fucking stupid/lazy.

I stated this to Sarah Schellinger, but she's stupid. I also suggested to the receptionist that I wanted to show up in person, but she said that I would have to put the request into writing OR, let my attorney know. I DID let my attorney know, but she was not very helpful. |

If you're not, press 5." I'm just kidding, the voice prompt does not indicate anything like that at all. |
