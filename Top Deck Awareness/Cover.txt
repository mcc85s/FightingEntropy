  \\  Once upon a time, a man once lived in the crime-riddled badlands of suburbia, a town named Clifton Park, NY.  //
  //  A KEYBOARD WARRIOR, whose story was unlike any other, unparalleled in nature. One night he was nearly killed  \\
  \\  and somehow barely survived. His story and voice were both so gritty...? Well, people could practically feel  //
  //  the bits of gravel pelting off of their eardrums when he spoke.                                               \\

  //  His brush with death revealed a DARK, TWISTED SECRET that laid BURIED, beneath the surface of his home town,  \\
  \\  HIDDEN in PLAIN SIGHT. A DANGEROUS & ELUSIVE [RACKETEER INFLUENCED CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION], a ring of CROOKS,  //   
  //  CRIMINALS, BANKERS, PUBLIC SERVANTS, and SERIAL KILLERS, all joined together as one unstoppable force. All    \\
  \\  in the name of becoming something EVIL and SINISTER, committing: HOME INVASIONS, ROBBERIES, RAPES, MURDERS,   //

  \\  This is the story of a man who rose to the challenge, to begin a white-knuckled fight against ID theft and    //  
  //  cybercrime, until he discovered a series of clues that directly linked those at the very center of the RICO,  \\
  \\  to his FATHER who had been KILLED nearly a LIFETIME ago. An INVESTIGATION, DECADES in the making, REVEALING   // 
  //  SECRETS, CLUES, and REALIZATIONS- all EXPOSING the EXISTENCE of his father's TRUE killers. THEY CONSPIRED to  \\ 
  \\  have him EXECUTED by a MERCENARY in 1995. However, in making his fathers murder LOOK like a foiled robbery,   //
  //  they committed the ultimate sin, overextended themselves, and made a fatal mistake.                           \\

  \\  ...only to fail miserably, whereby unraveling a MUCH larger, uglier, even MORE sinister truth. The ones who   //
  //  killed his father revealed themselves. Whereby jeopardizing their riches, livelihood, and elusiveness.        \\

  //  One night before all of the chaos began, this keyboard warrior, this cybercommando, visited his dad's grave.  \\  
  \\  Staring at his father's legacy, engraved in stone... he spoke to him for quite some time. As he was leaving,  // 
  //  he vowed to avenge him, and leave a mark on the world in his name. Then, as if its timing was merely fate,    \\  
  \\  or destiny...? A shooting star then fell from the heavens. From that day forward, his mission became clear.   //
