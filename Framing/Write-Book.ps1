Benjamin Franklin: It is the RESPONSIBILITY of EVERY citizen, to QUESTION AUTHORITY.
Keep this quote in mind, because it is the beginning and the end of this entire document.

$Book.AddSection(0,"Introduction (1)",@'
Benjamin Franklin was one of the founding fathers of the United States of America, and a very critical
one at that. Benjamin Franklin, was a dude that had principles down pat, as he was an avid writer,
quite the scientist, an inventor (invented bifocals), an able-bodied statesman, top-shelf diplomat,
printer, publisher, political philosopher... he was really a mixed bag when it came stuff that only
geniuses could do, back in his day. 

In other words, quite a rare guy.
One of his favorite philosophies was THIS quote
________________________________________________________________
| Though I may not agree with what you have to say...?         |
| I’ll defend, to the death... your right to say it. -Voltaire |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|

| ...then we don't believe in it at all.         -Noam Chomsky |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Anyway, it is this ideology AND philosophy, that became the inspiration for the first Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States of America. 

This philosophy was one that HE, along with the rest of the founding fathers, ALL stood by, as they
spent day after day, writing draft after draft, knowing that they may very well be the authors, of the
greatest document that has ever been written in history... 
____________________________________________________
| The Constitution of the United States of America |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Finally, the day came, they all looked at each other in suspense and asked each other:

 /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Guy 2 : ...this is...

Guy 3 : Yeah man.
Guy 4 : Look, we've spent almost (2) weeks on this thing...
Guy 3 : Yeah I know...

 \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

...they’d ALL been waiting for this day to come for a very long time... when the moment came, and the 
very last line was written...? That man had to shake his hand because it kept cramping up:

 /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

 Guy 1 : Damn, my friggen hand... 
         *shaking it around* 
         ...all cramped up.
 Guy 2 : You did an amazing job, dude.
 Guy 3 : That's right, dude.
 Guy 4 : I too, think you did a wonderful job.
 Guy 2 : *speaks more loudly* Everybody...
         Do we ALL agree that Guy 1 did a phenomenal job writing this...?
 All   : *clammoring* Hell yeah, dude.
 Guy 2 : Then, it is agreed upon.
         Quite an amazing document you've written, Guy 1.

 \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

He was right. 
They all signed the document, one that was an ETERNITY in the making... they all knew that this was
no joke... it needed to be ABSOLUTELY PERFECT... and it was JUST ABOUT COMPLETE, except...
(1) man still hadn’t signed it yet.
A rather important man... 
...this man was always known for being incredibly bombastic, so he knew the time was right, and so... 
...he gave his signature speech.

$Book.AddSection(0,"Signature Speech",@'
Franklin : Gentlemen, this is MORE than words on a piece of paper that we’re responsible for authoring,
           and signing.
           This will be the GREATEST document EVER written.
           This thing needs to be MORE than just, bulletproof.
           The paper may be destroyed...? But, its' legacy can never die.
           Its' philosophies may be amended...? But, its' principles will never lie.
           Freedom from oppression and tyranny will remain its' driving force...
           ...and even if one day it fails...? May it provide one last recourse...
           The foundation upon which this nation is built, needs to be INVINCIBLE, in theory...
           Therefore, every natural born citizen from this day forward... 
           ...shall inherit our labors freely.
           This document, the Constitution of the United States of America... 
           ...shall be hyperbolic and timeless.
           At last, the time has come... 
           ...for the very last man to sign this.
           *signs the Constitution of the United States of America*
'@)

$Book.AddSection(0,"Introduction (2)",@'
At that moment, the United States of America was finally formed, on an official basis, although the 
Articles of Confederation had been its original Constitution, this new version would replace it. 
It took approximately 12 days for these men to complete the document, and the document has been 
amended approximately 27 times, with the first 10 amendments being referred to as the Bill of Rights.

However- they knew that the hard work was complete.

They knew what they were writing, would be the beginning and the end, virtues that left no stone 
unturned, protecting/defending every American from that day forward... they would be damned to fail
their own future Constituents, children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren... 

...they knew tyranny would return, and tear it all apart... 

However, the United States became a true nation with one last signature from this man.

Benjamin Franklin was in Boston in 1706, he eventually moved to Philadelphia, where he became a
Freemason (architecture and stone) and was eventually promoted to grand master. 

As a young lad, his father was able to send him to Latin school for a couple of years. 
He wrote a lot, used a pen name “Silence Dogood” to try and get his work published. 
His brother was a printer, and he became his printing apprentice at the age of 15.

When he grew up he married Deborah Read, and fathered 3 children named William, Francis, and Sarah. 
His son Francis became very ill from an illness which complicated his planned inoculation for smallpox, 
and died. 

Benjamin Franklin became an advocate for smallpox inoculation afterward.

He did plenty of work in the colonial days (Albany Congress/1754) BEFORE the...
...Declaration of Independence.

Benjamin Franklin did not DISCOVER electricity, however, he DID perform many science experiments, and
was able to prove that lightning was in fact, electricity... by flying a kite in a storm with a
lightning rod attached.

He helped write the Constitution of the United States of Ameica in 1787, among many other documents.
He ALSO served as the US Postmaster General, where he literally handed out stamps of approval.

I selected this man for this introduction, because he is the spirit of America.
He is NOT the ONLY founding father of America, but he is a VERY CRITICAL ONE.

No, he didn’t give that speech up above (as far as I know)...
But, it is probably something he would've given a stamp of approval.
Franklin lived to the ripe old age of 84, when he became ill, and passed away from pleurisy.

Make no mistake... at one point in time, this man was considered to be MORE important than the 
President of the United States. The reason for that, is because he left behind a legacy like no other.

While he WAS the 6th President of Pennsylvania...? 
It was essentially the same role as governor, and the colonies were still working things out between 
themselves, on how to work in a similar manner, united as one, rather than divided. 

Although he never became the President of the United States, this dude had a slew of IMPORTANT DUTIES 
and SKILLS, and would occasionally be overwhelmed. He was plenty 1) qualified, 2) important, and 
3) capable of being elected President of the United States... many people actually asked him to run. 

Had this dude ran for President...?
He would’ve set the bar pretty friggen’ high on how to be one of the best presidents that ever lived...
...times 100.

Truth be told, the man never chose to run... because he was actually too busy being awesome.
What could anybody do about it...? You’re talkin’, the dude was too busy being a role model citizen, 
since he was the man everybody went to (including acting presidents), on how to: 
______________________________________________________________
| 1) set examples | 2) set new precedents | 3) raise the bar |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You just can't leave an opportunity like that to chance.
Especially if the acting president has a new pair of shoes to fill. 
America needed the RIGHT GUY for the job...
...and, if I gotta come right out and say it...? That guy, was Benjamin Franklin.

Much how each book has a binding that keeps all of the pages intact, this man was a critical piece to
how America came into existence. The original 13 colonies were still under British rule, until 1776,
when the story of the Boston Tea Party caused the colonists to officially rebel against the British 
army. The reason for the Boston Tea Party is this simple...

Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Without working CHECKS AND BALANCES... it always leads to tyranny and oppression.

This was the main motivation for writing the Constitution, although the Articles of Confederation 
would remain in effect until the “complete/current” United States of America Constitution was written
in September 1787.

Colonial American history is rather extensive, and articulate. I’m shooting for some level of concision
and keeping the story COMPELLING and FOCUSED, but it will eventually be quite thorough.

Colonial America had plenty of missteps, a lot of people died, and they probably wouldn’t have needed
to, if the people in England had a better idea of what they were pushing the colonists to do. 

In a parallel nature, modern society has some serious issues that require some (comparing/contrasting) 
between what motivated John Adams to write the central, most important piece of the puzzle.

This "piece" isn’t really so much as a “piece”, as it is the FOUNDATION upon which EVER American
citizen’s rights, liberties, and freedoms are GRANTED... and continues to be the bedrock upon which
everything else stands on.

This foundation has granted these RIGHTS, since the day they were written...
These RIGHTS have never really taken a BREAK or any days off at all... 
...the document exists until this very day.

That DOCUMENT, would in fact be... 
____________________________________________________
| The Constitution of the United States of America |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
It is THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENT THERE IS, in America, basically.
To oppose it, is considered an ACT OF WAR.

Perhaps there are VARYING DEGREES of what someone may perceive as OPPOSITION to the CONSTITUTION,
to where that OPPOSITION may then and there be CLASSIFIED as an ACT OF WAR...?

However, it is SAFE to SAY that SOME PEOPLE don’t realize, that CERTAIN PEOPLE have INSULTED its 
EXISTENCE, or SPAT in its' FACE. Repeatedly, too. 

While the Constitution established the base from which additional amendments were 
made, most particularly the Bill of Rights, this document is still the most important of them all.
"@)

$Book.AddSection(0,"Transition",@"
I’ll say it right here and now, there’s a lot of fuckin’ swearing and offensive language in this 
document. Oh well. The Constitution allows people to say stuff.

It ALSO allows people to LIE to other people, if they want to.
It ALSO allows people to TAKE ARMS and FORM A MILITIA, if they feel a sense of TYRANNY and OPPRESSION.
It’s not a great idea to DO something like THAT, if you can use WORDS instead...

However, TWO issues exist in this modern age | These will be thoroughly explained 
    (1) PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION           | ← (PM) for short  
    (2) the concept of CENSORSHIP            | ← (CS) for short

Sometimes people use this LYING technique, FAR too often (part of PM).
Even the POLICE, the POLITICIANS, the MILITARY LEADERS, and even DIRECTORS of GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

At that point, this activity MAY drive ANOTHER CONSTITUENT, to give that person a swift fuckin’ punch to
the face. The problem is, NOW, it is ILLEGAL to do that.

As such, people will take advantage of that, and lie to people ANYWAY, because they’re not afraid of
getting  assaulted for doing so. | ← PROBLEM

Now, there’s a SERIOUS fuckin’ problem with that, actually.

It’s caused a lot of CORRUPTION. | ← SERIOUS PROBLEM

If I notice people in the government LYING and COMMITING CRIMES, and NOBODY DOES ANYTHING ABOUT IT...?

Then, it stands to reason that it is probably grounds for TAKING UP ARMS...
...and FORMING A MILITIA. | ← RESOLUTION

Guess what...? 
That shit is TOTALLY LEGAL.

The fact of the matter is that people with a LOT OF MONEY tend to lose sight of their MORALITY.
As such, SOME OF THEM WILL LITERALLY ROLL OVER EVERYBODY ELSES RIGHTS, and commit HEINOUS
CAPITAL CRIMES that are NEVER ENFORCED by the LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM.

ALSO, the JUDICIAL SYSTEM which attempts to provide JUSTICE, sorta SUCKS ASS AT THAT SOMETIMES.
Hope I've made myself ABUNDANTLY FUCKING CLEAR, so far.

I’m gonna say this right here and now, there are a number of problems with society RIGHT NOW, but it has
VERY LITTLE TO DO with GUN CONTROL. It has A LOT MORE to do with SOCIETY and CORRUPTION.

There ARE legitimate concerns by people in the government and in the community, in relation to every 
individuals' mental health and well-being. Nobody is arguing that at all here in this document.

However, there’s a MUCH LARGER <PARENT> PROBLEM, which is INDIRECTLY CAUSING THESE ISSUES.
In SOME cases, the <MUCH LARGER PARENT PROBLEM> is in fact, CAUSING THESE ISSUES DIRECTLY.
That means, people LYING, CORRUPTION, ESPIONAGE, and CENSORSHIP are being used in CONJUNCTION...
...by people in the GOVERNMENT, CORPORATIONS, the LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM, and the JUSTICE SYSTEM.

What this ACCOMPLISHES is that it ALLOWS the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO OPERATE EXACTLY LIKE...
1) a COMMUNIST STATE (for instance, RUSSIA or CHINA)
2) a MONARCHY (for instance, GREAT BRITAIN)

That's what's going on around the country, as well as in YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS.
It also has a DIRECT IMPACT on people CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTIES AND FREEDOMS.

So, if all these things happen in CONJUNCTION...? 
It's time to FORM A MILITIA, and then... START ARRESTING PEOPLE.
Because... the CONSTITUTION ALLOWS ALL CITIZENS TO DO THIS LEGALLY.

Yeah that means a PRESIDENT can in fact be ARRESTED by CITIZENS in a CONSTITUTIONAL MILITIA.
And, everyone BELOW the president too.

But- pretty sure that a PRESIDENT won't go to such a moronic extreme to be subjected to this.
Unless you're GEORGE W. BUSH. 
I'll get to the Bushmeister in [Chapter 7 - USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Surveillance Capitalism].

As it stands, the politicians aren’t being PROACTIVE enough about preventing MASSACRES such as:
__________________________________________________________________________
|  Uvalde, TX | Buffalo, NY | Dayton, OH | Reno, NV | Dallas/El Paso, TX |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
In ALL of these scenarios, they have EACH occurred, because the POLITICIANS are FUCKING LAZY.
I will repeat that... It is because the POLITICIANS, are FUCKING... LAZY.

They're NOT lazy at all when it comes to making sure that they get paid a lot of money.
THAT PART...? They are incredibly on top of.

The part where INNOCENT PEOPLE keep being SHOT TO DEATH in a rather VIOLENT WAY...?
Ohhhhhhhh.
That's the part that they're FUCKING LAZY about.
There's no excuse for this shit to be happening, EXCEPT FOR...?

The politicians are fucking lazy, and they don't have their priorities in order.
That's why this shit keeps happening.

I will talk about AN INCREDIBLY INTELLIGENT SUGGESTION that the POLITICIANS should ALREADY BE DOING.
It's called SURVEYS. Not unlike the CENSUS.
Here's the problem, SURVEYS are supposed to be INCREDIBLY EASY TO MANAGE, especially in an economy
where SURVEILLANCE is CONSTANTLY OCCURRING.
__________________________
| SURVEYS | SURVEILLANCE | notice how the (2) words are pretty fucking similar...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Well, the reason for that is because, they're actually the same concept.
Go figure.
Billionaires get to watch everything people are doing, but nobody's asking people questions
about their MENTAL STATE, or EXPEDITING THE PROCESS for MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES for SUSPICIOUS
INDIVIDUALS. It has to be done PROACTIVELY, not REACTIVELY, otherwise 19 kids and 2 teachers
will just get mowed down by somebody else that nobody was keeping an eye on, too.

So, in reality, I'm 100%, indisputably correct here, the POLITICIANS are FUCKING LAZY.
EVERYBODY IS BEING WATCHED ALL THE TIME, that's what SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM IS.

As for the politicians being lazy, well...
They're not ALL lazy...?

But a lot of them DEFINITELY are. For instance, TED CRUZ, and that's because of (Exxon Mobil/Big Oil).
And, Fox News.

Anyway, you'd need 2 billion guys like TUCKER CARLSON to be able to make these things called
CORRELATIONS. That's mainly because TUCKER CARLSON isn't a smart dude, and neither is SEAN HANNITY.

These incidents are OUT OF CONTROL, and they appear to be happening primarily, in AMERICA.
There’s a GOOD reason for it. CORRUPTION, BRIBERY, INJUSTICE, LAZINESS, EGREGIOUSNESS, GREED, SLOTH, etc.

Brick by brick, layer by layer, wall by wall, corner to corner... 
If every brick making up a building has a DEFECT, then that building won’t be very strong at all, will it?

Apply the same exact concept to every individual having no principles, and lying to whoever, whenever, and 
not caring. Ah. That’s just it man. That is a serious fuckin’ problem.

In reference to (POLICE/LAW ENFORCEMENT)... 
SOMETIMES, they really aren’t very bright.
Especially when it comes to PROVIDING THEM WITH EVIDENCE.

That's when they're typically fuckin’ overpaid morons, actually. 
Though, I am in fact, generalizing that to a large degree.
Many of them are not morons at all...?
However, I really hope that the ones who AREN'T morons, understand that I'm gonna lose my fuckin cool
in this god damn book, and just start calling a LOT OF THEIR COWORKERS and BUDDIES... morons.

There’s a lot of components to that, however.
Are they ALL morons? 
No, they’re not.

However, MANY of them they will PISS ALL OVER YOUR RIGHTS, and treat you like you aren’t fuckin’ worthy
of the law. Because, if a CRIME is committed by someone in the GOVERNMENT...? Nobody does anything.

I mean just look at how HILLARY CLINTON got away with being INVESTIGATED by the FBI, and JAMES COMEY
literally allowed this woman to escape being PROSECUTED WHATSOEVER. But- mysteriously, the shoe being
on the OTHER foot...? JULIEN ASSANGE FROM FUCKING WIKILEAKS IS BEING EXTRADICTED TO THE UNITED STATES,
HE IS NOT EVEN AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, AND HE'S BEING CHARGED WITH COMMITTING ESPIONAGE, just like EDWARD
SNOWDEN. The ESPIONAGE ACT of 1917. In JULIEN ASSANGES CASE...? 
_________________________________________________________________________________________
| What INJUSTICE looks like... (these two are "guilty" of doing the same fucking thing) |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ASSANGE gets (175) years for NOT committing a crime (wasn't against the law)          |
| CLINTON gets   (0) years for     committing a crime (was definitely against the law)  |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
And, you know what...? This is why I have to call people MORONS.
Because... people should really be concerned why ANDREW CUOMO and HILLARY CLINTON aren't charged
with ANY CRIMES for their CRIMINAL BEHAVIORS.

Meanwhile, INNOCENT PEOPLE can get CHARGED FOR WHATEVER FUCKING REASON the government feels like.
What I'm STATING is that they can FABRICATE A REASON OUT OF THIN AIR, and GIVE THEMSELVES 
PERMISSION TO DO WHATEVER THEY FUCKING WANT TO DO. (← Why the CONSTITUTION was WRITTEN)

That's TYRANNY, plain and fuckin' simple.

The police, in many cases, don’t bother to INVESTIGATE nor ARREST (that person/those people).
If they DO, they just PRETEND like they give a shit.
As long as they do an awesome job of PRETENDING...?
That's all that matters to them.
They did an AMAZING job, of PRETENDING to give a shit.
Not ACTUALLY giving a shit.

Who's gonna stop em from doin' that...?
Are you...?
Hm...?

Nah.
Nobody's gonna stop em, nobody can.

So what happens, is that guys like ANDREW CUOMO can KEEP BREAKING THE LAW, and...
...NEVER FACE THE MUSIC for it. And somehow nobody sees GEORGE ORWELL'S 1984 being a
real thing. Hm.

Let me crunch it ALL down to be SO SIMPLE...?
Even a toddler might be able to understand what I'm saying.

If THEY wanna have somebody KILLED...
...or BLACKLISTED...
...or EXTRADICTED...
...or SMEARED...
...or GUTTED LIKE A FISH...
...or THROWN IN PRISON...?

Then that's what they'll do, without PUBLICLY SAYING A FUCKING WORD.

So, it'll never make it to CRAIG APPLE's desk.
Nor MICHAEL ZURLO's desk, either.

Nah, cause they PRETENDED like they didn't see the fuckin' problem...
...in a SOCIETY called SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM.

That means that they fuckin' saw it...?
And they just looked the other way.
That's not ALL THAT DIFFERENT, from some dude being found with a dick in his mouth,
and trying to tell ANYBODY that caught him with that dick in his mouth...
"Look dude, it's just your opinion that this looks gay."
Nah buddy, sometimes when you have a dick in your mouth, opinions aren't involved.
Just FACTS.

A man being found with a dick in his mouth, means that it's FACT that they are GAY.
That's not an OPINION.
That's a FACT.

So whether it's some dude being found with a dick in his mouth, or innocent people being killed...?

Those people will just be killed in a violent and silent way, by serial killers that they hire.
Typically, these SERIAL KILLERS are in fact, PRIVATE MILITARY CONTRACTORS that are PAID to EXECUTE a
SPECIIC TARGET.

Just so we're clear here...?
That is ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

Resultant...?
Well, many laws need to be put under "AIR QUOTES".
Effectively just like ROYALTY.
So, a member of LAW ENFORCEMENT can PRETEND like they didn’t see a “law being broken”...
...then “EVERYONE ELSE” should be able to do that “too”. 

They just chose to ignore it. | ← that is effectively TYRANNY and CORRUPTION 

So, if you see someone “important” that happens to be committing a “crime” ...? 
Well, ask that officer of the law to “do their job”.

They get paid to “do their job”, so if they’re NOT “doing their job”, I will teach you how to get 
creative about it. To basically light a fire under their ass (← metaphor)

Sometimes, you can see this process unfold where they won’t fuckin’ see the problem at all...~!
That’s because, sometimes they can’t help that they’re fuckin’ morons.
Sometimes they CAN...! But- they just choose NOT to. Unfortunately...? That’s too fuckin’ bad.

If they prefer NOT to do their job, then they are right then and there choosing to NOT be paid. 
If they tell ya NAH BRO, then you find a way to tell them JOB NOT DONE BRO.
If they tell ya IM TOO BUSY, then tell em … | ← it is really pointless to keep going with the argument. 
It really is.

I’ll discuss this repeatedly throughout the entire document. 
I don’t hate cops, at all.

However, I notice how much RESISTANCE many of them put up, because they are TAUGHT so many (PM)
techniques that allow them to be incredibly (LAZY/INCOMPETENT), in many cases. | ← TYRANNY & CORRUPTION

So, again... THEY get PAID to DO THEIR JOB. 
They DON'T get PAID to NOT DO THEIR JOB.
But- SOME of them will tell ya to FUCK OFF if you try wavin’ your finger in their face.
I’m not exaggerating.

(Some of them will literally kill you themselves, and TRIED to do this to me on MAY 26th, 2020.)

If they’re NOT DOING THEIR JOB, then you have a RIGHT, to manipulate them.
...to do that job.

If it’s not getting done...?
Why the fuck are they getting paid...? 
OH. 
That’s a SERIOUS PROBLEM.

Law enforcement is supposed to be the END ALL, BE ALL, LINE OF DEFENSE and INTEGRITY
So, if you see police officers sucking Prince/Andrew/Cuomo’s dick for a promotion...?
...that’s neither one of those fuckin’ things.

It winds up causing problems in society to occur ELSEWHERE...
...and INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE BECAUSE OF IT. | ← PROBLEM

If two dudes wanna blow each other...? That’s ok. | ← NOT THE PROBLEM 
It’s totally legal if two dudes wanna do that.

HOWEVER... If neither 1) Prince/Andrew/Cuomo nor 2) the guy who wants an easy promotion understand HOW
they’re CHEATING other people that work a lot fuckin’ harder to get ahead...? | ← PROBLEM
That’s a fuckin’ serious problem, and it won’t stop with (1) blowjob either.

Now, sometimes a police officer STILL won’t care...

The problem is, sometimes the police don’t actually care about whether they have a job to do or not.

I will UNPACK/EXAMINE ways of dealing with BOTH of these issues, as well as what's causing ALL of them.
Because the problem is INCREDIBLY COMPLEX, however...? 

There are a lot of things to explain.

I am going to DISASSEMBLE many differing aspects of PSYCHOLOGY, and explain those aspects in simple
terms. Though it’ll be FAR from an actual DOCTORATE in PSYCHOLOGY, this document SHOULD effectively 
provide people with a BASELINE EDUCATION, in reference to the MANY various aspects of PSYCHOLOGY. 
(^ RESOLUTION)

Not to mention, might help a lot of dudes get some broads. 
And, there’s plenty of humor in it too.
Broads and humor COMBINED, sometimes.

Yeah, I’m not even gonna wait... the problem is that the BRITISH MONARCHY has CORRUPTED AMERICA, though, 
the problem is definitely far worse than just that. 
The problem is SO BAD, that I needed to write this document that’s about 700+ pages.

The INDIVIDUALS are NOT the only ones to blame. 
This is a SOCIETAL issue and the PROBLEMS are HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT.
I will make a lot of references to the hit series BREAKING BAD.

I suggest watching that series in entirety, because of how many compelling analogies and metaphors are 
conveyed in it. That show conveys a lot of aspects to psychology as well as morality. 

As far as this material goes...?

Fox News USED to be news.

Someone2 : Oh, it’s Not News.
Someone1 : Oh wow. 
           Is this even real...?
Someone2 : Well, I don’t know. 
           It’s literally, the Not News channel.
Someone1 : Well, if it’s the Not News channel, that means it’s-
Someone2 : Not News. 
           Right.
Someone1 : But this looks like REAL people saying REAL words though...
Someone2 : Right. 
           That’s cause, that’s what it is...
Someone1 : Well, it sure LOOKS like news.

Someone1 : I’m confused. 
           If it’s NOT news, then what the hell IS it...?
Someone2 : I dunno man, but... 
           ...it’s either some sick joke, or...
Someone1 : ...not a credible news source to be taken seriously...
Someone2 : Well, who the hell would actually watch this shit, if it’s Not News?
Someone1 : I mean, what they’re saying is INTERESTING, but- 
Someone2 : It is somewhat INTERESTING... 
           But, it sounds BIASED and NUANCED.
           Heavy use of RHETORIC and SUGGESTIONS as to how someone SHOULD feel about it.
           That’s not actual news, at all... 
           ...that’s propaganda.
Someone1 : Ah. 
           Maybe that’s why it sounds so INTERESTING...~!
           But, that’s something a RIGHT WING CONSPIRATIST would say.
Someone2 : I’m no RIGHT WING CONSPIRATIST...
Someone2 : Just an ordinary dude.

Someone1 : But if it’s not news, then it’s not a news station.
Someone2 : ...I meant, propaganda station.
Someone1 : Weird. 
           Almost like some rich person with a lot of power, is just...

           This is fucked up.
           I buy ALL this shit that’s in these commercials...
Someone2 : Hey man, what can anybody really do about it?
           These people wouldn’t be on television, if they lied all the time, right?
Someone1 : Damn straight. 
           Somebody would’ve shut this shit down by now, if they did...
Someone2 : So, maybe it’s a trustworthy source of news after all.
Someone1 : But, it’s Not News.
Someone2 : Maybe that’s just the name, and it’s definitely news after all.
Someone1 : Nah man, somethin’ about it all just doesn’t feel right to me.

           That’s probably what this all is, isn’t it?
Someone1 : It has that APPEARANCE, for sure...

Yeah, so, the Fox News Organization, is essentially some rich dude named RUPERT Murdoch playing god. 

At one point in time...? 
RUPERT Murdoch HAD integrity...
His “news organization” began, as part of the heritage of the American mainstream media.
Coverage of the political landscape, current events, and leveling out the news channel landscape. 

Now, he’s lost his way, and acts a lot like VLADIMIR PUTIN. Seemingly identical.

Anyway, that SHOULD be their slogan, and they SHOULD change their name...
...but providing people with SUGGESTIONS like that, probably feels BIASED and NUANCED, doesn’t it...? 

Because the RHETORIC would probably make YOU feel like a total dick...
...if you didn’t follow those SUGGESTION, huh?

Well, if TUCKER CARLSON fuckin’ thinks something is cool, then you better think it’s fuckin’ cool too, man...
Or... or nothing.
      That’s right. 
      People can say “Nah, I don’t have to think that shit’s cool at all, fuckface.” | ← consider this

However, that’s actually how PROPAGANDA fuckin’ works, believe it or not.
The problem is, if TUCKER CARLSON is the most popular thing in the industry, 
    ...then there’s a SERIOUS fuckin’ problem, actually.
    ...cause whenever HE and SEAN HANNITY say shit like “OoOhHh Climate change ain’t real, ya fucks...~!”
    ...maybe those guys won’t think a pair of broken legs is real either. Ya know...?
    ...maybe a tornado whips up a baseball bat, and like, mysteriously flies around their studio...
    ...miraculously misses everybody else...
    ...somehow, that fuckin’ thing managed to break both Carlson’s legs, AND Hannity’s...
    ...pretty sure they’ll think climate change might be real after all...
    ...then again, maybe not.
"@)

$Book.AddSection(2,"When Insults Are Warranted",@"
Climate change is definitely fuckin’ real, and I can translate how that is, to corruption in the government.
Almost like, Cause → Effect...
Corrupt politicians accepting bribery from Exxon Mobil like Ted Cruz, not being arrested for THAT, 
...by the morons that call themselves the police... right?
Bribery is illegal. If it is seen, arrest that person. 

It’s like, pretty fuckin’ easy to see that shit.
So, when they DON’T do that, that’s grounds to shoot that police officer, actually.
I’m not suggesting that people do that.

But what I am suggesting, is that these people should STRONGLY CONSIDER IT.
Because here’s the thing...

Ted Cruz, has already earned himself a right to be shot, so why do 19 kids and 2 teachers have to die...
...instead of him...? If that guy kept calling Ted Cruz a fuckin’ cocksucker all the time, Ted might’ve had
*some* way of knowing what was going on in his jurisdiction, ya know? But, all that money probably blinded him...

 Realistically, Ted Cruz could have no way of knowing what’s on everybody’s minds all day, every day, it’s not 
possible, nor would I expect that. However, there’s an ALTERNATIVE where the dude actually makes certain that a     
program exists, where that kid has somewhere to go. Ya know? 
   __________________________________________________________________________________________________________
   | Don’t grab a rifle and shoot innocent little kids, cause that’s moronic. ← what Ted Cruz COULD’VE said |
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Ted Cruz is a lazy fuck. 
But I know some people will tell me “He’s not a lazy fuck dude, he’s… rich and famous.”
I’ll say “Cool. He IS PARTIALLY responsible for that. Money/fame doesn’t prevent it. Now, shut the fuck up.”

I shouldn’t be the guy offering suggestions like that, that’s what that motherfucker’s job is, to think of 
creative solutions other than allowing Exxon Mobil to drill him between the ass cheeks for millions of dollars 
(sort of how Carlson and Hannity get paid) and let some little kids die. My daughter is their age. 

Ted Cruz and Greg Abbott are DEFINITELY some people that deserve MORE blame than the sheriff wearin’ glasses 
on the press conference, but hey- some people need advice on how to blame the CORRECT people... I could tell 
that dude is not like Michael Zurlo or Craig Apple. Nah, I can tell that sheriff was fucking MORTIFIED because 
I could see it in the man’s face. 

People shouldn’t EXPECT that ANY of those officers are gonna walk right into some fuckin’ bullets man. 
They didn’t want to get THEMSELVES shot to death, without protective armor. I’m sticking up for the police 
right here, I would’ve been scared shitless to go in there too. Anyone would’ve been. This is where getting 
some advice from Chris Voss would be very relevant, worthwhile, and appropriate. Anyway...

You can’t expect a police officer who makes an average salary of a LOT FUCKIN LESS THAN TED... to wanna walk 
into a real nice, calm, steady stream of some of the finest warm bullets ever made... cause, that’s a colorful    
description for something’ pretty fuckin’ stupid. Nobody wants to get shot. Not saying that the kids all 
deserved to die either, BUT- there’s a SOLUTION where some douchebag who gets paid way more money, he 
should’ve been the first one in there, man... and if you’re a smart enough person, you might realize that I’m
referring to a PROACTIVE approach, rather than a REACTIVE approach. 

This cocksucker makes more than Carlson OR Hannity, combined~! I think. Greg Abbott, I really have nothing 
BAD to say about him, but he’s still a question mark to me, because I don’t fuckin’ know.

Obviously, Ted doesn’t have the training, nor the speed of fuckin’ Goku (character from Dragonball Z), to 
instantly transmit (quantum teleportation, basically) himself to the scene in full protective body armor 
and gear, lookin’ like Sylvester Stallone, with a rag tag group of fuckin’ beefed up soldiers, ready to call
themselves expendable. Yeah. I realize the humor might fall flat, but it’s there... Ted is gonna get torn up 
quite a bit in this document. I’m movin’ on...

Or like, the people that just died in Buffalo... why do they get to be shot dead instead of Andrew Cuomo...?
The reason is, guys like Ted Cruz or Andy Cuomo, they think they can fuckin’ break laws. Laws that other people 
would get arrested for, but if they do it- it’s fine. So, that means, fuck everybody except them.

Let’s not jump to fuckin’ conclusions here and start shooting people.
There’s still time to talk some sense into people FIRST, that’s a PROACTIVE approach.
Doesn’t work if you’re getting CENSORED though...

However, the WAY that the SYSTEM is currently ESTABLISHED...
...actually FORCES people to lose their fucking minds, and go on a rampage.
Maybe it doesn’t FORCE people to do that, it’s their choice.

But I mean, it’s being rather short sighted to think that people actually WANT to do that shit.
Buffalo...? That kid had some serious fuckin’ problems, and that kid DID want to do that.
Uvalde, didn’t PREMEDITATE the idea for months. He just snapped.
There’s a HUGE DIFFERENCE between the two, and people should closely examine WHY.

Yeah, and listening to guys like Carlson/Hannity … is like Europe buying oil from Russia while they’re 
fighting a war. Sounds fuckin’ stupid, doesn’t it? That’s cause it is.

I don’t think for one fuckin’ minute, that Benjamin Franklin would’ve accepted millions of dollars from 
Exxon Mobil, in fact, he probably would’ve grabbed a rifle, and shot that person. 
That’s SORTA why the National Rifle Association exists.

But hey, maybe we should give up our second amendment like a bunch of fuckin’ tools, cause Carlson said 
Somethin’. Yeh, Carlson or Hannity... fuckin’ tellin’ everybody to give up their rights left and right.

Someone will probably label me as an EXTREMIST for saying all that shit.
But, most people won’t catch onto the notion, that, I literally JUST stated, 1 guy, is somehow MORE 
important than 19 kids, and 2 teachers... and then translated THAT... to HIM accepting bribery.

Or Andrew Cuomo, can drag his lazy dick around all day, make some guy who works for him suck it, and then 
file a CPS case against me, cause he’s a fuckin’ cocksucker like that. Nah. You can’t even really offend 
someone in the government without them shoving a dildo in their asshole, AND/OR abusing their position or 
authority.

Now, just cause I insulted (Cruz/Cuomo), doesn’t mean I’m gonna insult Biden, and tell him that HE fucked 
up in Afghanistan. The MORON BEFORE HIM set up an ARRANGEMENT with the Taliban for May 1st, 2021. People 
will make a fuckin’ stink about how Biden just wasn’t paying enough attention during a deadly COVID epidemic.

However, that whole scenario means that America just HANDED the Taliban `$1T+ of equipment we ALL paid for: 
weapons, ammunition, explosives, tools, vehicles, tanks, helicopters, buildings. 
That’s (1) reason right there, to not (vote for/listen to) Trump, without a grain of salt being nearby.

However, Cuomo is more than just fuckin’ moron. He DID sexually harass those 11 women, none of the fuckin’ 
police actually commenced with charging him and bringing those cases to court, because, guess why...? 

Guys like Craig Apple and Michael Zurlo are little cuntrags (much less Apple) that hide in the shadows and 
think they can do whatever the fuck they want to. Yeah, sometimes people have to consider that they have to 
INSULT people in order to avoid having to shoot them with a pack of militia buddies, and that’s not TERRORISM 
nor is it EXTREMISM, if the cops are fucking intentionally being lazy. 

It’s literally written in the Constitution, actually. The Bill of Rights. Oppression. Corruption. 
If someone has a job to do, such as, arrest Hillary Clinton during a criminal investigation at the FBI...? 
What you would wanna do to remain CREDIBLE to OTHER PEOPLE, is 1) arrest her, and 2) bring her to jail.

Not, wave off criminal investigations and then let her run for president. Know what I’m sayin’? 
Cause that’s fuckin’ stupid. Someone broke the law, and could do so again... but if you did that, 
they sure as hell WOULD NOT HESITATE to ARREST you and bring you to jail, like... Julien Assange. 
So much time in the Ecuadorian embassy, and still got invaded and brought to prison to serve out 175 years. 
A dick got shoved in his asshole, forcibly.            (I’m exaggerating, no dicks in his ass from what I understand) 
Cool, huh?                                                                           (being facetious, it’s not cool)

Do I want these guys to think I’m gonna do something like that...?
No. They could just stop being such a fuckin’ pussy, and do something about it, when 11 women say 
“that dude sexually harassed me”. Cause, what example do these fuckin’ clowns actually set, when they 
spread their ass cheeks, and let Cuomo pound them in the asshole...?

They’re most likely NOT getting their asshole invaded by Andy Cuomo. But I mean, theoretically, they can’t 
even prove that they’re NOT, can they...? If anything, it looks somewhat likely, that a gay guy named 
Andy Cuomo, can wreck some fuckin’ sausages in his off time, and then in the midst of a scandal that looks 
SO FUCKIN’ BAD... that even Chuck Todd wanted him to resign...? Somehow this fuckin’ sausage wrecker managed 
to slip away, unable to be charged with crimes and stuff... 

What if like, MURDERERS were able to do that...? Ya know? Serial killers too. Just, they’re in the same
category as Andrew Cuomo. They can fuckin’ kill whoever, and if they’re caught...? 

Oh well. Nothing anybody can do. Might as well climb under a rock, and just live there. 
Cause they’ll let those fucks off the hook, huh?

Well, no. 
If someone KILLS people, then that’s a pretty good reason for them to prosecute somebody like Cuomo or a 
serial killer. But NOT if it’s BRIBERY, or RACKETEERING, or EXTORTION.

I’m not even fuckin’ kiddin’, these dudes, Craig Apple and Michael Zurlo, aren’t very fucking bright.
Neither is Paul Pelagalli. This dipshit ordered me to see 2 doctors that don’t even work at the fucking place 
he ordered me to go to, but I’ll rip into him later on.

Anyway, what if this dickhead Andrew Cuomo actually forces his coworkers to suck his dick, OR, makes 
Michael Zurlo suck his dick, OR Craig Apple suck his dick, so that they actually BECOME the guys who run 
those counties...? Ah. A girl named Erin Canning who was like a US Marshall, she told me that this dude 
DEFINITELY does that shit.

I already had a suspicion that Cuomo had actually slandered me, by submitting a CPS case to Laura Hughes at 
Saratoga County Children’s Protective Services... And, I can even prove that Saratoga Hospital violated HIPAA, 
by sharing those details with the petitioner. And I can prove that SCSO had a police officer that ignored 
several crimes that happened to me. A series of them.

I’m fairly certain that’s what this cocksucker did, because I kept blasting him on social media.
Cause, Andrew Cuomo’s a fuckin’ sausage wrecker like that. I’m not gonna use the word I REALLY would like to 
use to describe him, specifically... in this document, because I actually CARE if I offend someone that might 
think I’m bound to use a bunch of SLURS in this document, swearing and slurring aren’t the same thing. 
Calling Andrew Cuomo a fuckin’ sausage wrecker... it’s better than the other word I’d rather use.

If he did call CPS and have the state abuse all these fuckin’ offices to have my kids taken from me, and 
tell the local police, or FBI or whoever it was... to lock me out of my fuckin’ device, after (2) dudes 
tried to kill me on May 26th, 2020, then yeah. I will probably hurt that motherfucker. With my fists. 

Because that’s concealment of an attempted murder that Shaemus Leavey was shown. Someone was using a tool 
called PEGASUS. Now, I’m not certain, but I’m confident that CUOMO had nothing to do with the (2) dudes that 
tried to kill me in a video I recorded on my iPhone that somehow got disabled after I showed a portion of 
it to Shaemus. What I can definitely say, is that Shaemus was lookin’ out for me and TOLD ME that SCSO was 
likely to do some shit to me. Michael Zurlo apparently likes to have his units fuck up every fucking case 
I’m involved in, and I’m not even exaggerating that at all... I’ll rip on the county sheriffs later.

Now, occasionally, people might need to follow some SUGGESTIONS, but... if SUGGESTIONS and RESPECT are treated 
as ONE WAY STREETS, you have to STOP and CONSIDER that anyone expecting it to be a one-way street is probably 
asking to get themselves smacked across the face with a reality check. Cause, there’s actually TWO WAYS that...

...RESPECT and SUGGESTIONS travel. But, sometimes people will pretend like that’s bullshit, and say stuff like 
“I DONT HAVE TO ANSWER TO YOU...” 

Ok, so, they SAID that. 
THAT’S where INSULTS work out fuckin’ PERFECT, actually. 
Because, a lot of entitled brats, like Prince Andrew, or Royalty, or Andrew Cuomo... they all think that way.

Prince Andrew had a fling with Ms. Guiffre, and they had a picture taken with one another. 
Prince Andrew is actually a fuckin’ moron, and tried to lie to everyone about it, just like OJ Simpson lied about     
killing Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman. Same level of “lie hood”. 

That’s how fuckin’ stupid this guy is, he actually tried to say “That’s not me in that picture” or even 
“I don’t recall that at all”, but that’s cause he’s... a fucking moron, believe it or not. 

Anyway, if you INSULT them enough times...? 
Hell, you can even MANIPULATE some of these people to try and KILL you, 
You can actually cause these people to start CENSORING you and even catch it on AUDIO/VIDEO.
They really don’t like that though, because that means you’ve become a THREAT.
That’s why these devices happen to be smartphones that they can remotely disengage, or lock you out of.

They heard you X number of times, they weren’t ignoring you at all.
The rest of the people won’t ever realize that someone was doing A LOT MORE than just IGNORING somebody.

Because if they CENSOR you, and they prevent you from showing EVIDENCE in a courtroom...? 
That’s when it BECOMES TIME TO FORM A MILITIA, because that becomes a 1776 reason to kill someone. 
That’s TYRANNY. That’s why guns are pretty useful.

The police carry guns, why doesn’t every citizen...?
NOT for shooting 19 kids and 2 teachers in a school... 
NOT for shooting a bunch of people at a supermarket...
...but for someone that ABUSES their AUTHORITY, and overextends themselves as a <insert ANY role> or whatever.

Because ALL of that shit is ILLEGAL and UNCONSTITUTIONAL... 
So, they may as well ASK you, to grab a gun and EXECUTE them, with that line of reasoning.

And they are perfectly content with people knowing you’re onto them too, from what I can tell.

But also, the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries too.

They’re all corrupt from top -> bottom.
That’s why the fuckin’ weather is getting DRASTICALLY worse each year.
Last year was the hottest summer on record.
Over the last 10 years, the previous 8 years were the hottest summers on record.

But, I know that a lot of people are gonna ignore all this shit I’m writing.
It’s cause guys like Ted Cruz have this routine with the oil companies.
That routine involves HIM, spreadin’ his ass cheeks apart (like a woman would) and the oil companies just 
slide their peckerwood, in-and-out of the man’s asshole, in exchange for `$millions_of_dollars.

If it sounds gay, that’s cause it is... 
If it sounds offensive, might as well stop reading now cause I say a lot worse shit throughout the rest 
of the document.

It’s not explainable with any other COMPELLING analogy, I’m afraid. 
It is hands down, the best analogy that could possibly be made. 
Ted Cruz, likes when big oil drills off-shore...? on-shore...? Or, even between his ass cheeks. 
He’ll let em drill anywhere they want.

I’m gonna hold off on Ted Cruz momentarily, and focus on Hannity and Murdoch. 
Here’s a skit, not unlike when Eminem dissed Insane Clown Posse.

Murdoch : Yeah buddy, if you wouldn’t mind...

          That was *chuckles* a LOTTA jizz, Rupe...
          How was that...?
Murdoch : *zipping his pants up* Man, you’re a fuckin’ real champ there, buddy.
Hannity : Hey- anything for a friend, right?
Murdoch : Sean, shut the fuck up and get back to work. 
          Tell people climate change isn’t real, and doesn’t exist.
Hannity : OoOoHh, alright Mr. Grouchy. 
          You know I will.
Murdoch : You know, you act like such a queer, dude.
Hannity : You’re the one that just asked me to suck your dick.
Murdoch : Nah I didn’t.
          You’re out of your mind, dude.
Hannity : You just said you wanted your dick sucked.
Murdoch : Yeah, but I didn’t ASK you to do that.
          You OFFERED to do that.
          Big difference.

$Book.AddSection(2,"Abusive Relationship",@"
Sean is in an abusive relationship with Murdock.
Then Sean tells everybody that he was at the "dojo". That’s not a fuckin’ dojo buddy...
May as well tell people he was practicing the skin flute.

Carlson, and Hannity, their suggestions are the equivalent of telling people...
"You really are a dumb motherfucker if you trust me." -Carlson/Hannity/Fox News

The problem is, if these men I’ve written about so far each LITERALLY said these things, people will just 
continue believing the lie, cause people are in denial. They may even say to me “Fuck you bro. These guys? 
They’re awesome.”

Ted Cruz really could say "I DO let the guys from big oil fuck me in the ass whenever. It’s fuckin’ awesome."
And everybody would say "Cool, Ted. Nobody gives a shit."

But I’m sure SOME people might. Maybe his wife or girlfriend, or children, or whatever.
Cause then they’ll realize why people say things about them all the time...
...they’ll be quite sickened by footage, then his wife and kids will have to take off.
...changing their names and identities...

...cause they finally had the veil of denial lifted from their faces.

Might even enter the witness protection program, cause they never wanna see that dude, ever again. 
Yeah, when people accept bribery money from the oil/car/gas industry...
...those people have to worry about how they look when it’s recorded on video.

$Book.AddSection(2,"Enlightenment [!] Why smartphones are useful AND deadly",@"
The reason why smartphones are USEFUL and DEADLY, is because they’re useful if you have...
100% complete control over the device
    
However, NOBODY has 100% control over ANY device. Not without a (PHYSICAL POWER SWITCH/REMOVABLE battery)
If you have an iPhone, you’re not getting that thing off without opening that thing and unplugging the battery
I showed a New York State Trooper (Trooper Carter) actually, “how to do this”, but backwards.
He was absolutely impressed because, he didn’t know what the hell I did. He’s also a moron.
Batteries are INTEGRATED and SEALED for a VERY INCONSPICUOUS REASON.

With an iPhone, you can actually turn your device OFF, and it’ll still power CERTAIN components.
The police are morons, sometimes. They may not know that, or they may just lie to everybody about it.
...either way you look at it, the (police/military/hacker) can track people down with 911 calls...
...BUT- they can actually have a DIRECT CONNECTION to YOUR device, without YOU even calling 911...
...or even having the (WIRELESS/RADIO), on. 

Yeah, on MY iPhone 8+, I had the BLUETOOTH, WIFI, and CELL...
...radios OFF, and somehow I STILL received information from my network connection... That means, that
...the screen TOLD me that the radios were off... But...? They weren’t off at all. 

I have been doin’ this for... *checks watch* 21 fucking years, basically.
If this shit sounds too difficult to believe...? 
I don’t give a flying fuck what you think. 
I know what the fuck I’m talking about.

Because ALL that means, is that someone doubts something I’ve spent my ENTIRE LIFE, KNOWING and DOING.
Or, they’re PLAYING STUPID. Which, the POLICE and GOVERNMENT will DO this.
Believe it, I’m willing to insult some people that were just THAT oblivious...
Because this information may save YOUR life someday.
You’re welcome.

Components that can be remotely accessed without your knowledge, consent, permission:
GPS location, WiFi/Bluetooth/Cell Radio, Earpiece, Microphone, Camera, Text messages, call history, 
Passwords, Fingerprints/Biometrics, FaceID, Notes, Emails, Pictures, Videos, Audio recordings...
...you could theoretically be recording an interaction with a police officer, or federal agent...
...and if they have prior knowledge of WHO YOU ARE, and WHAT MAC ADDRESS THAT DEVICE HAS...
...they can terminate the recording while it is in process.

They can even DISABLE YOUR DEVICE if you have recorded evidence of them attempting to murder you. 
Most of the POLICE do not know, but that is 100% correct...
That’s why telling them is POINTLESS.

While smartphones are INCREDIBLY useful, that device can be turned into a WEAPON at any given time.

___________________________
| Q : What is CENSORSHIP? |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
CENSORSHIP is when things people SAY or DO are REDACTED, or their EXPOSURE is THROTTLED/KEPT FROM... 
...OBSERVATION BY OTHERS. 

This is actually illegal. However, some censorship IS agreeable.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
| Examples: People having sex on TV, black bar covers nudity (← Agreeable)                              |
|           Swearing on a public broadcast                   (← Agreeable)                              |
|           Taking things out of context in a speech         (← Questionable, requires additional info) |
|           Preventing people from being able to talk        (← Not agreeable)                          |
|           Classifying an act of treason on 9/11/2001       (← Not agreeable)                          |
|           Facebook limiting exposure of certain users      (← Not agreeable)                          |
|           Classification of “Collateral Murder”            (← DEFINITELY Not agreeable)               |

| Q : Why does CENSORSHIP happen? |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
They do this formally with (broadcast television/social media), but many aspects of COMPANIES, or 
PUBLIC ENTITIES are also subjected to differing grades of CENSORSHIP. 

Sometimes it happens because an INDIVIDUAL, ORGANIZATION, PUBLIC ENTITY, COMPANY, AGENCY, POLITICIAN, or 
<unspecified> is choosing to MINIMIZE the OPINION, STATEMENT, OBSERVATION, or FACT that another entity 
communicates to the general public. 

So for instance:
__________________________________________________________
| Example #1) If there is NUDITY or PROFANITY on TV      |
|========================================================|
|...that is DEFINITELY CENSORSHIP, but it is NOT ILLEGAL |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
| Example #2) Using a program such as Pegasus/Phantom to prevent a 911 call from reaching an emergency  |
| dispatch station...                                                                                   |

___________________________________________________________________________
| Q : Why would someone commit CENSORSHIP if the condition is illegal...? |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
There may be worse criminal activities or unconstitutional things taking place, and they can be committed by 
basically anyone, ESPECIALLY the GOVERNMENT, POLICE, or the JUSTICE SYSTEM. 
These parties [LOVE*] to use this technique, which is why it’s worth noting that RECORDING STUFF is SUPER USEFUL.

For instance, if I submit a FOIL request for (regular/911) call transcriptions after an employee at the 
Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office provided instructions to obtain them, and that same agency DENIES the request, 
that is a form of CENSORSHIP (Not agreeable). That may also fall under OTHER terms.

But in addition, what would the reason to do such a thing, be MOTIVATED by...?
In this case, suppose MICHAEL ZURLO is committing obstruction of justice, then that is HIGHLY ILLEGAL, IMMORAL, 
and there are some serious criminal charges for doing something like that IF caught AND it CAN be proven. 

Not exactly something that a COUNTY SHERIFF should EVER think to do, or even be SUSPECTED of doing, as this 
is probably very rare.

However: It is worth consideration, that either a (STATE/FEDERAL) organization or individual may have also 
done that. It is ALSO worth considering that this falls under other terms, such as RACKETEERING.

Another instance, requires a couple layers of explanation...

|  SUBJECT | Ted Cruz                   |
|     ROLE | Senator (from Texas)       |
|  OFFENSE | Accepting Bribery money    |
|   MOTIVE | Monetary compensation      |
|    PARTY | Exxon Mobil                |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Suppose `$this.Subject commits `$this.Offense while performing `$this.Role, `$this.Process is analogous to 
allowing `$this.Party, to bend `$this.Subject over, spread their ass cheeks, stuff `$this.Subject’s asshole, 
and pump `$this.Subject’s butthole with a solid stream of jizzlings, in exchange for `$this.Motive. 
That’s not a clear-cut definition of BRIBERY, that’s actually the same thing a porn star does… 
…but it’s also PROSTITUTION (if consensual).

I’ve ALSO DESCRIBED how a CLASS DEFINITION works in programming, where `$this.PROPERTY is part of the PROCESS.

Under non-consensual conditions, it’s RAPE, but typically a rapist will not be providing monetary compensation 
to a rape victim.

Prefixing the statement with “analogous” makes that an extremely colorful analogy not to be taken LITERALLY.
Monetary gains would be the MOTIVATION here. But, there may be multiple factors as a motivation.
Regardless, the analogy suggests that IF the subject gets `$500M from the party, and can lie to people about 
climate change... he may be lying about other things. Such as: their sexuality, or the size of his sphincter, 
or if it bleeds a lot. But also, the subject may also lie to people when questioned about CENSORSHIP taking 
place, in reference to a citizens colorful opinion being expressed in a public forum, or document/book/movie.

Facebook, is a perfect example of how censorship may be applied.
The idea being that the subject may have MULTIPLE offenses and MULTIPLE motivations to keep a *wink* “secret”.
So, the idea of committing an offense as serious as censorship, probably isn’t given much thought, or 
consideration. In other words, there’s something pretty fucked up happening after all, and someone wants it 
to be DOUBTED by others. 

The truth is, people in the government will typically brush off outrageous claims, they won’t make the effort 
to CENSOR an individual unless they are attempting to HIDE SOMETHING SERIOUS. Which means, that IF someone is 
stating something that JUST SO HAPPENS TO BE ACCURATE...? It will actually MANIPULATE/PROMPT the suspected 
party INTO performing CENSORSHIP. Which means that they’re choosing to DOWNPLAY something BECAUSE it is accurate.
If somebody says something FALSE about somebody, it won’t get CENSORED, or shouldn’t anyway... But when it’s 
true, for instance “If MARK ZUCKERBERG has people killed by SERIAL KILLERS, so he can STEAL THEIR IDEAS...”,
then he wouldn’t bother censoring a statement like that... unless it was TRUE. Because he wouldn’t want people
to talk about something like that. Nope. The concept is quite counter-intuitive, that’s the point. Accurately   
identifying a PLAUSIBLE theory will cause people to ABUSE THEIR AUTHORITY, which becomes EXTREMELY OBVIOUS.

That is why CENSORSHIP is VERY SERIOUS in some cases.

The analogy is... probably going to cause him to get pretty pissed off when people start to talk about it.
At that point, this may lead to EMBARRASSMENT, then, he’ll probably have somebody CENSOR me.  Which, that’s 
illegal. So, much in the same manner that Ted Cruz was fucking oblivious as to the mental state of the 
deranged lunatic that successfully murdered 19 kids and 2 adults in Uvalde, Texas...? 

Ted Cruz will want to minimize “calls for help/colorful analogies where he’s getting drilled between the 
ass cheeks by Exxon Mobil”.

But, if he’s LYING about getting BRIBERY money from an OIL CORPORATION, then guess what that means...? 
He’s committing a CRIME that’s not being ENFORCED by ANYBODY. People should be SERIOUSLY ALARMED by that. 
Because, that could be grounds for having to take the law into your own hands.

The reason why the analogy is so colorful, AND, generates a lot of animosity from the public, is because they 
made it possible to where they can DO all of these things, but if you even think about using your 
FIRST AMENDMENT in the BILL OF RIGHTS, to ACCURATELY analogize what they do...? 
They will CENSOR the dog shit out of you... THAT DOES NOT MAKE IT LEGAL OR ACCEPTABLE AT ALL. 
However, many people will assume as such. Because most people aren’t aware what their rights are.

Most people don’t know what the hell CENSORSHIP is, OR, they don’t realize when it is happening to them. 
There are very OBVIOUS signs when someone is being CENSORED, typically it comes down to:
    ____________________________________________________________________________________
    | FAMILY HISTORY | NET WORTH | REPUTATION | CREDIBILITY | ESTABLISHMENT | LOCATION |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
FACEBOOK is NOTORIOUS for this, and the problem is so challenging to CAPTURE and REVEAL, that it can require 
multiple parties to DETECT it successfully, and then provide EVIDENCE of it to the general public, without 
being CENSORED even more. 

Signs of (CENSORSHIP/Specifically on Facebook): If you’ve been posting a lot of things, but when you TALK to 
people directly, they didn’t know you’ve been posting this or that, they’re not actually seeing anything you 
post. The moron that thinks they’re being SLICK, will cause MOST PEOPLE to assume that people are just TOO BUSY, 
or there’s NO WAY that they SAW WHAT YOU POSTED, because with that profile’s EXPOSURE being LIMITED, it will 
just SOUND REALLY RARE to OTHER PEOPLE... 
_________________________________________________________
| Q : Why will people think this CENSORSHIP is rare...? |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Because in some cases it is incredibly challenging to prove.
But- it ranges in aggressiveness, from mild annoyance, to hiring multiple security personnel to contain a 
target, perhaps even hiring private military contractors to execute a target.
___________________________________
| Q : *scoffs* LOL ...execute...? |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Yes. Execution. It happens. Sometimes, it might actually look like an accident, other times, people go missing.
_______________________________________________________
| Q : ...why though, that sounds really excessive...? |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Yeah. It is, but really, you have to combine all of the things I’ve stated thus far throughout this document.

IF you become a [THREAT*] to SOMEONE SPECIFICALLY, then that THREATENED PARTY will cause OTHER PEOPLE to ALTER 
THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF YOU – which is done in varying ways, by ALTERING the VARIABLES and PROPERTIES of:
RECORD(s), SERVICE(s), or PRODUCT(s)

RECORDS such as POLICE RECORDS, (COUNTY/STATE/FEDERAL AGENCIES), even MEDICAL RECORDS, 
    ...or even JUSTICE SYSTEM DOCUMENTS, or EMAILS, OR, entries within a DATABASE.
SERVICE such as POLICE INTERACTIONS, MEDICAL TRANSPORT, SOCIAL SERVICES, POWER, ELECTRICITY
PRODUCT such as YOUTUBE, REDDIT, TWITTER, VERIZON, SPECTRUM, FACEBOOK – VERY EASY FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE

These VARIABLES and PROPERTIES are basically [numbers] or [strings of text]. 
Changing a BIRTH RECORD from 1999 to 1975, probably unlikely, 
       ...POLICE RECORD CRIMINAL OFFENSE from THEFT to MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE, also very unlikely
       ...SOCIAL STATUS such as EXPOSURE 1 to 0 on FACEBOOK (← MARK ZUCKERBERG IS GAY LIKE THAT)
Essentially (1) means [ALL of your friends will see a post], and (0) means [NONE of them will see a post].
       ...COURT RECORD such as a TRIAL DATE from NOVEMBER 4th, 2021 to NOVEMBER 7th, 2021 (pretty easy)
This doesn’t necessarily apply to software like FACEBOOK, but it may ALSO apply to OPERATING SYSTEMS or 
DEVICES. So, APPLE DEVICES, or ANDROID DEVICES | It can even include MAIL/MEDICAL FRAUD, the possibilities 
are seemingly ENDLESS.
________________________________________________________________
| Q : These examples sound out of the ordinary or excessive... |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
They may be, but, if I were to call Andrew Cuomo a fuckin’ sausage wrecker, he might go to some rather 
extraordinary measures to really fuck with people. But, what if it’s someone more important than him...?

At which point, these may be excessive suggestions, but STILL CONSIDER THE LIKELIEHOOD TO BE ABOVE 0.
Regardless, people’s perceptions of a specific individual will begin to consider the target as an 
ASSUMED THREAT. Because no matter how much these things are explained, the average person may believe that 
individual is being UNREASONABLE or even PSYCHOTIC. That’s mainly because, people may not give a shit. 
Until it happens to THEM... then they WILL (give a shit/care). Cool, huh?

The bottom line is that EVEN WITH ALL OF THIS INFORMATION BEING KNOWN, people will have an incredibly 
difficult time believing it. Why...? Because most people that have been VICTIMIZED by these actions 
NEVER KNOW IT HAPPENED.
In some cases, they just DIE long before anyone ELSE ever finds out.

However – typically if someone is attempting to change variables and properties around, they will want to 
leave as minimal an impression as possible that causes the maximum level of change with the minimal amount 
of leverage, (for instance, putting a piece of tape over somebody’s mouth) which means that typically it won’t 
be ALL of the examples I’ve listed... it’ll typically be one control that manages it all.

When a connection is made between STRATTON AIR NATIONAL GUARD, and FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, and even 
SARATOGA COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE, and FACEBOOK... usually there’s a good reason why they haven’t killed a 
specific target quite yet. That’s because someone ELSE also knows what’s happening.

End Result: The above should show pretty easily, how one thing leads to another. It needs fixing.
Not every case of censorship means someone did something illegal, and therefore, limiting someone’s exposure 
to other people isn’t much different from a rapist or murderer putting tape over someone’s mouth so others 
can’t hear them scream.

| Colorful Analogy (1): Murdering that pussy |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
When a (guy + girl) fuck, and she’s screamin’, someone says “Sounds like a fuckin’ murder scene or somethin’...” 
...that doesn’t mean that what’s happening. “Murdering that pussy”, does not mean she’s getting murdered...
but ya know, it’s makes a (COMPELLING ANALOGY/METAPHOR)... for some girl gettin’ her vagina filled. Ya know?
Andrew “Don’t touch me, grandpa” Cuomo can’t do that. 
Otherwise, he wouldn’t have 11 women filing sexual harassment charges.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Now, Cuomo COULD consider dramatically raising his chances of success by ALTERING: (Females/0%) → (Males/100%)
So, “sausage wrecker” is a (COMPELLING ANALOGY/METAPHOR)... for some dudes cobbin’ on each other’s knobs.
Or, maybe it’s one knob at a time getting’ cobbed on, or look- I don’t fuckin’ really CARE to describe it.
It’s bad enough that I keep saying it about Hannity/Murdock, but they keep saying “climate change is fake.”

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I’m going to do my very best to explain to people HOW FUCKED UP AMERICAN SOCIETY IS, and how it may be POSSIBLE,
…to REPROGRAM IT...

The reason why [CURSE WORDS*] are rarely ever heard on TV, is because [THEY*] expect people to have some DECENCY.

That’s a COMPROMISE I can make. But, if Fox News exists to distribute PROPAGANDA and then LIE to everybody,
         ---------------------                             ---------------------          ----------------
and the gov’t does that shit too, there’s no RECOURSE for that at all EXCEPT what is WRITTEN IN THE CONSTITUTION. 
    -------------------------             -----------                        -----------------------------------
So, if YOU swear at somebody “IMPORTANT”...? Oh. 
People will say: “Wow bro. You gotta a lot of nerve to call Andy Cuomo a sausage wrecker, dude... wtf.”
Yeah. RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH ALLOWS SOMEONE TO DO THAT, even if it sounds offensive. It’s not doubtful, either.
Also, defending a GOVERNOR that was SEXUALLY HARASSING some of the WOMEN he worked with is a lost cause.
_______________________________________
| Why defending Cuomo is a lost cause |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Cause it wasn’t 1 woman, nor 2, 5, or 10. 11 MINIMUM. Sounds like the dude wrecks sausages to me, dude.
Why 11...? Ya know...? Why not 50...? Or like, 2000...? Or 5 million...?
The thing I’m attempting to ILLUMINATE is the PATTERN.
              ------------------------        -------

I’m not gonna call some gay kid that happens to be a governor, a sausage wrecker for no reason.

Some people might, I had reasons to, because he let 20 kids die in a limo in 2018, and basically did nothing 
about it. George Pataki would’ve rolled up his fuckin’ sleeves, and made damn certain that something got 
done right there and then while havin’ plenty of sex with his fuckin’ wife.
"@)

$Book.AddSection(2,"Shoutout [+] George Pataki",@"
George Pataki was a GREAT governor for the state of New York when I was in (elementary/middle/high) school.
He succeeded Andrews father Mario Cuomo (wasn’t bad from what I remember), and was succeeded by Eliot Spitzer.
George Pataki had a ceremony for crime victims at the State Capitol after my father was killed in 1995.

I was too young to really remember what was said, but I remember he did stuff like that.
He didn’t like, sit at a fuckin’ desk, have a press conference where he lied the entire time, and have a sign
language dude basically repeat a bunch of lies, unlike Andrew.

Pataki did a lot and was in the news a lot and when HE said something was gonna get done...? It got fuckin’ done.
Nah I just remember Bill Clinton gettin’ shit done in the oval office and George here in New York, giving each 
other fist bumps from several hundred miles away, getting’ it done. Clinton had a SURPLUS BUDGET when this dude
was in office, and I’m fairly certain it’s cause back in that day/age, people knew what the hell they were doing 
and how to cooperate. Pretty sure that Chuck Schumer worked a lot with Pataki too.

Clinton was a great president, believe it or not. Obviously, Hillary had plenty to do with him getting INTO 
office, as well as running the country, but- the Lewinsky situation really left a stain on his legacy, and this 
dude George Pataki never had something like that to worry about. Why...? Cause, he would have waited to get some 
dome from his wife. Not sayin’ that I blame Bill, but, ya know. The last couple years of Clinton’s presidency 
was basically him being a lame duck president. Not a great situation for anybody.
"@)

$Book.AddSection(2,"Give Andrew Cuomo SOME Credit",@"
Anyway, this dude was too busy trying to get these girls to fuck him, right...? 
All of em said “Nah. I’m all set...” (← I wonder why they ALL say/do that...)
Then he’s like “Hey... C’mon. I’ll buy ya dinner and whatevs.”
If I were any of those girls, I would’ve said somethin’ like:
“Listen here, ya fuck... You’re old. I puked in my mouth.”
Then he could’ve gotten the impression that they all said no for the same reason, right...?
It’s cause THEY weren’t thinkin’ about chokin’ on a big fat D whenever he was in the room. HE was. Ya know...?

Cuomo wasn’t really a BAD governor. He started out with a plan and a vision. He just failed to come remotely
close to guys like Pataki or Spitzer. Spitzer was the former Attorney General until he was elected governor. 
He had some killer ideas, and I thought he was bound to smack a grand slam, up until he got caught in a sting 
that I’m fairly certain, Andrew Cuomo had something to do with. Anyway, at some point, Andrew fuckin’ Cuomo,
started blatantly lying to people. EACH time he did...? I immediately noticed. “Yeah, things have never been 
better around the state.”  

Maybe in New York City, sure dude. Way better in NYC, where all of the states’ money gets sent off to. Some 
spots in Upstate New York, ARE better...? But- really, I’m not sure where this dude was getting his facts 
from. I gotta say, it sounded like he was sittin’ in a room with no fuckin’ windows all day, every day, to 
say something like that. 

A lot of people are dying from drugs, medical fraud is rampant, so is insurance fraud, public servants and 
state agencies are incredibly corrupt, maybe this dude meant “Besides all of THAT stuff...? Things all around  
the state are WAY better.” So, if you don’t consider the RACKETEER INFLUENCED CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION which is 
consisted of TANSKI, HOFFMAN, CATRICALA, ZURLO, and etc., who all basically commit FRAUD under everybody’s   
nose... OR, the SERIAL KILLERS who work for the NYS CORRECTIONS TRAINING ACADEMY at 1134 New Scotland Road 
that use PEGASUS/PHANTOM to kill a lot of people, and even if you record VIDEO of them in the act, they’re 
very good at never being detected/caught, since the (FBI/Apple) will actually remotely disable an iPhone that 
has such evidence stored on it, whereby protecting THOSE serial killers from being caught... OR, 20 kids 
gettin’ crushed to death after a WEDDING in a limo that was SUPPOSED to be inspected, but wasn’t. I don’t 
know, dude. 

I think that Andrew Cuomo’s BEST EXCUSE would be “I actually dropped like 3 sheets of LSD to my dome piece 
that day when I said that...” Cause then I guess I could forgive him for saying something that fuckin’ stupid.
Besides all that? Oh, yeah. The state’s definitely doing WAY better, the guy even hand-built Exit 3 by himself. 

I’m literally fucking amazed by what this man did. My god... if I wasn’t already holding onto something
that’s fixed to the GROUND...? Might’ve actually gotten blown right into the oblivion of fucking space. 
Cause. Andrew fuckin’ Cuomo, being as AWESOME, as he is/was...? Got the fuckin’ job done, bro. 

Maybe in rare cases, the economy is slowly getting better, as long as you discount the fact that some people 
are just earning millions of dollars scamming people. Some of the PRIVATE companies are doing well, that 
doesn’t necessarily mean that the COST OF LIVING seems to be steady, or that the QUALITY OF LIFE is steady or 
improving. The Malta Tech Park was supposed to be this big booming industry that brought in jobs, but from 
what I can tell, it’s basically a huge missed opportunity... since most of them hire from out of state. 

I looked forward to that place being completed too, since I used to drive around delivering the Times Union all 
around lower Saratoga County to the businesses, as Luther Forest was being flattened and constructed. At least, 
GF/Ryzen did phenomenally well. Cuomo DID sorta have major involvement in that. Not in engineering anything at 
all, but rather, in asking actual professionals like the Pickett brothers, in what they should do up there in 
Malta.

Cuomo was very eager to capitalize on an idea called GlobalFoundries/Malta Tech Park, that Eliot Spitzer FIRST  
conceptualized, way back when he was the Attorney General and then became the actual Governor of the state. It 
was such a large, bombastic idea, that Spitzers name should be on the fucking sign on every entrance to the 
place, since Cuomo is NOT the person who came up with the god damn idea. I don’t think that Cuomo would’ve 
ever thought to come up with such an awesome idea on his own, but his god damn name is plastered all over the
campus, isn’t it...? Yeah. It sure as hell is.

Anyway, NYSERDA was something that was supposed to capitalize on making really energy efficient things, like
solar panels, and reduced carbon emissions technologies, and I actually researched it before I had an interview
with Nfrastructure in 2010. That tech park campus has been basically giving OUTSIDERS more opportunities. 

Look, Cuomo, was not a real GREAT governor for the ~10-11 years he remained in office... Why...? Uh, consider
reading the above paragraphs again. I could understand if the dude was embarrassed by something I SAID on MY 
FACEBOOK PROFILE... cause he was pissed that females actually confront ME, and they’re like “Hey, wanna fuck?” 
and I’d say “Fine.” cause that doesn’t happen for him, does it...? Sorta speaks fuckin’ volumes if that dude 
can read what I have to fuckin’ say, right...? But then I am not told that he was offended by what I said. 

That right there, tells me that some people really act like big pussies. Sausage wrecker material right there.
Here’s a helpful tidbit of advice: don’t have MEN suck your dick. Cause, that’s a real big turnoff for girls.
Britanny Commisso will probably agree.

Peaceful Resolutions... 
So, invoking your RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH posting on FACEBOOK: “ANDREW CUOMO IS QUITE A SAUSAGE WRECKER ALRIGHT”

Well... some people will get offended by that for SURE. I think that people just get offended by shit that 
someone with a nutsack decided to say, and so, rather than for me to provide someone that I don’t really have 
a whole lot of respect for, an “ass kissing”, or like “sugar coated bullshit”, I decided to tell somebody 
what was really on my mind. More people should do this, but they don’t. 

Because if they fuckin’... if you try to talk to somebody, but they don’t get back to ya, then there’s a 
good chance that insulting them might get their attention, or even cursing at them. Cause excuses are like 
assholes, everybody’s got one. People expect respect and if you don’t give it to them, they’ll fuckin’ 
ACTUALLY respond without words. 

Yeah, I don’t expect people are gonna get back to me if somebody on YouTube has like 1.7 million subscribers,  
and I made a post. I’m not gonna feel butt hurt by no response. BUT- I’ll see the signs, somehow, that someone 
fuckin’ heard me loudly and clearly, and ASSUMED that there’s no fuckin’ way that I’d never be able to tell 
based on their REACTIONS, or something changing.

Yeah, some people really are that fuckin’ stupid. They may think that shit means someone is crazy, but no. 
That’s not what it means. It means someone is probably a hell of a lot more intelligent than THEY are.

Regardless, a post like that using a totally different term than SAUSAGE WRECKER...
That’ll immediately violate Facebook’s Community Standards, unless I misspell it or something.
It’s not a real difficult word to find an alternative for, but- sometimes it hits the correct emotional note.

I wonder why it used to work so well when people commonly said it back in the 80’s. 
It’s still in the song “Money for Nothin’”... I think what happened is that everybody started crying.
Like, Mark Zuckerberg probably single handedly didn’t like being called one, and made it impossible to say 
it in a post. He acts like one sometimes. Especially when I know he’s interacting with me through his 
platform sometimes. Doesn’t mean he’s not someone I respect, but- sometimes it’s a term of endearment.

Look, Mark Zuckerberg has a few issues. (← I believe he has people killed so he can take their ideas)
Obviously, I know that trying to be cheeky sometimes isn’t going to cause the dude to forget when I fuckin’ 
blew his ass up back in... 2019.

I was pretty aggravated with what happened over CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA, and I still have plenty of reasons to 
suspect him being involved with some serious shit involving national security and Russia, and no more was 
that readily apparent to me than it was on January 6th, 2021. I don’t think it’s too much of a stretch to say,
he may have been directly involved in the murder attempt on May 25th, 2020 → May 26th, 2020. 

Cause Facebook wasted NO TIME whatsoever BANNING ME for 30 days after I’d been nearly killed.

The point is, dude probably needs some help, and who knows if he’ll ever find it. His company has some 
challenges where GREEDINESS is likely to leave a STAIN on his LEGACY for ADDITIONAL TIMES in the FUTURE, 
UNLESS... he ADOPTS the IDEA that “Maybe making a LOT less money, and making the platform a lot SAFER, 
might lead to sustainable, long lasting ethical growth.”

Targeting the RICH KIDS and MAKING SURE they’re the MOST POPULAR ONES on the PLATFORM, is likely to BLOW UP 
in his FACE, cause I’m ONTO HIM. I KNOW that’s what’s been HAPPENING and that CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA was the LAST 
STRAW for ME. I really wouldn’t openly call him anywhere remotely close to what Cuomo is, or does... MARK is 
not a SAUSAGE WRECKER, he’s just a fuckin DOUCHEBAG about CENSORSHIP and INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT. 

I’ve made some PROPAGANDA for his ass BEFORE, used a lot of EXPLETIVES in that and made that man CRY a bit. 
Sorry bro, didn’t mean to make you feel like a woman. Luckily, I don’t think he would do something like trying 
to fill his anal cavity with a dildo... But- he probably WOULD try and get somebody KILLED with a PROGRAM like 
PEGASUS/PHANTOM, cause… it’d be pretty fuckin’ OBVIOUS that he wouldn’t do that HIMSELF, he’d ask SOMEBODY to 
do that FOR him, and my cousin RYAN WARD has probably had a HAND in that. These videos below are: signs that

$Book.AddSection(2,"Expressing Something Offensive",@"
As far as posting something offensive on Facebook that might upset someone in the government’s pride, 
it’s gonna cause someone to abuse the platform or maybe they’ll ask some people at Facebook:

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

That might lead to CENSORSHIP on FACEBOOK, for sure.

I doubt a lot of people are gonna see the COMEDIC VALUE of the stuff I write, cause... if I’m being 
CENSORED, then they’re not gonna get exposure to it, so I can keep on writing and if they ever see anything, 
it’s gonna fly over people’s heads.

I know I write funny material. Pretty easy for me to see that it has nothing to do with my sense of humor at 
all. I’ve heard worse from people a lot less talented. I know I’ve hit some type of TRIFECTA where someone:
1) doesn’t think I’m funny at all OR doesn’t have a sense of humor
2) gets SUPER OFFENDED cause I come up with a lot of ORIGINAL IDEAS
3) is INCREDIBLY EASY to MANIPULATE

...so I see a dystopia where some COOL people who haven’t pissed off some people in particular, get to be 
funny, but people like me that are actually writing hilarious material...? I’m not getting EXPOSURE. 
So, I know that I am being held in place, and the exhibits are just growing longer and longer.

Hence, why I’m writin’ this document. Man. Almost like there’s a whole society of people that don’t realize
how hard a billionaire is working to keep me quiet...~!

Marshall Mathers did that stuff quite a bit when he started writing rap material. 
I don’t rap, not even gonna try. 
What I WILL do, is occasionally write something that’s rather well thought out, and I’m damn 
certain it doesn’t get any activity. Why...? Oh. It didn’t go down like it has over the last 3+ years since 
I was in Bennington... Hm.

Prior to that...? Man, wasn’t really worried about random posts being sniped from existence.
But now, it is clear as day.
CENSORSHIP meaning: MAJOR REDUCTION IN THE (VISIBILITY/EXPOSURE) for any (PARTICULAR/EVERY) (POST/COMMENT/ETC.)

While I would agree, offensive (terms/slurs) ARE worth getting SOMEWHAT offended over...? 
The following is MUCH WORSE: 
FORMER GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO ABUSED STATE RESOURCES AND COMMITTED MANY CRIMES IN OFFICE. 
The end result is: people won’t actually be offended by that statement at all, they’ll say 
“That’s probably accurate.”

So, people will actually get MORE pissed off by:
                 MY NON-ILLEGAL WORDS 
...rather than HIS VERY-ILLEGAL ACTIONS

That’s why AMERICAN SOCIETY needs some REPROGRAMMING.

So, let me recap. If I call ANDREW CUOMO A SAUSAGE WRECKER, everyone’s gonna get extremely offended by that 
and fuckin’ ignore me... They’ll call me a fuckin’ asshole too... Whereas, a GUY WHO USED TO BE THE GOVERNOR 
GETS HIS DICK SUCKED BY GUYS IN (POLICE ORGANIZATIONS/STATE AGENCIES), LIKE MICHAEL ZURLO OR CRAIG APPLE... 
That’s not worth getting offended by, is it...? Even if I had PROOF of such a thing...? Nah. 
The WORDS I said were CONSIDERED MORE OFFENSIVE.

Sure, ok, people seem to have trouble making the CORRELATION with FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION/SPEECH, and CENSORSHIP.

they’re basically IDENTICAL to the MILITARY. The ACTUAL, REAL-LIFE, United States of America MILITARY,  
ARMY/NAVY/MARINES/AIR FORCE. A lot of MILITIAS have CURRENT or FORMER military SOLDIERS, as well 
as amateur civilians that have been TRAINED or have some DESIRE to be a PART of that COMMON INTEREST/PURPOSE.

So like, ANTIFA is sort of a MILITIA...? But, not really, that’s more of an IDEALIST COLLECTIVE.
A MILITIA will be a combination of an IDEALIST COLLECTIVE as well as HIGHLY TRAINED, SURGICALLY PRECISE, 
WEATHERED AND COMBAT READY group of SOLDIERS who are ready to tell the police or whoever...? 
“Get the fuck out of the way.”

Basically, if a CONSTITUTIONAL MILITIA decides that it’s time to TAKE BACK CONTROL,
the CONSTITUTION says that’s TOTALLY LEGAL, and THEY ARE MORE IMPORTANT than the ACTUAL MILITARY/POLICE/ETC.
When I say MORE IMPORTANT, what I mean is HIGHER RANKING.

I can’t provide any specific examples for an EXISTING MILITIA, because if I say WHITE SUPREMACISTS, that’s 
not gonna be the thing I’m attempting to describe. I’ve seen plenty of exhibits on Vice Media where they cover 
some of these outfits, I think the one episode I saw was way down in Louisiana or somewhere in the South, 
whereas, saying the Hells Angels or something, they’re a motorcycle club though that may be a generalization. 

GANGS, are not the same thing as a MILITIA.
MOTORCYCLE CLUBS, are not the same thing as a MILITIA.
A MILITIA, wears the SAME EXACT EQUIPMENT that ACTUAL, REAL LIFE, CURRENT, (ARMY RESERVE/MILITARY) SOLDIERS 
would wear, sometimes they wear SWAT gear. Sometimes, the SWAT team IS a MILITIA.

What that means, is that the Constitution allows someone to be a fuckin’ potty mouth, because it illustrates 
how our founding fathers wanted Constituents to have a FREEDOM FROM OPPRESSION. The BOTTOM LINE, is that the
Constitution says it’s ok if I say something that might cause somebody to LAUGH or FEEL SCARED. 

It also says that I can FORM A MILITIA and HOLD SOMEONE IN THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE when they’re COMMITTING 
CRIMES SUCH AS: TREASON, CENSORSHIP, BRIBERY, RACKETEERING, or EXTORTION. 

I realize that’s gonna get some of these douchebags that are committing crimes willy-nilly, to feel SCARED... 
It probably should, because they’ve been getting away with an easy meal ticket for a while, and the POLICE 
can’t be expected to do their fuckin’ job if:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Policeman  : I think you’re committing a crime...
Politician : Shut the fuck up. 
             Oh well, I’m a politician that accepts bribery.
             What the fuck are you gonna do about it...?                    (← that would piss me off if I were them)

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Well, some of those police officers are actually going to join the militia if they’re fuckin’ sick of it too.

The police COULD arrest these people, but if they’re not ALREADY doing that... then they’re either FUCKIN 
MORONS, or they’re KNOWINGLY ALLOWING IT (sometimes that means the same thing, for instance MICHAEL ZURLO). 
They may even be AFRAID to do so because they may be TERRIFIED of what may happen if they do this all alone... 
but also, there’s a really good chance that they don’t even realize that their superiors have instructed them 
to do something ILLEGAL. 

So, not following orders from a superior officer that’s ALSO BRIBED, can lead to situations where that officer 
will get in trouble for attempting to enforce the law.

Not only that, but then ALSO, the judges. Many of them are corrupt, too. It’s not like ‘OoOoohHhh there’s a 
couple people breaking the law that haven’t gotten caught yet...’ Nah, it’s literally... fuckin’ everywhere. 

But we have a series of rights that are literally written in the Constitution, that allow any citizen to take 
up arms. The justice system has established so many ways of taking control away from people, but the CONSTITUTION 
OVERRIDES MANY OF THOSE LAWS. So for instance, legally, I’m not supposed to OWN a firearm, because I was 
convicted of a felony in 2002.

However, the Constitution says that doesn’t really fuckin’ matter.
The POLICE are trained to see that as a problem because... society has been programmed to do a bunch of 
stupid bullshit that isn’t CONSTITUTIONAL, nor LEGAL.

In other words, there are ACTUAL LAWS, that are ILLEGAL to EVEN EXIST.
I could technically file a lawsuit against Judge Paul Pelagalli CURRENTLY, for sentencing me to (20) days in 
jail, because of the recording I made and posted on Facebook. That LAW is UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
However, the justice system has a fuckin’ problem.

Many of them want a meal ticket anyway, so they’ll just fuckin’ totally ignore that part where the CONSTITUTION 
exists, and then lock ya up. Cause many of them are morons. Also, lawyers, many of them make their job sound 
a lot more difficult than it really is. Good lawyers are actually just well-respected people.

I’ll talk more about the (law enforcement + justice system) in:
[Chapter 3 - See no evil, Speak no evil, Hear no evil (Malice)]

$Book.AddSection(2,"Peaceful Resolution",@"
Objective: (1) lousy politician is accepting BRIBERY which is a CRIMINAL ACTIVITY
That is a FELONY which carries a sentence of 3-5 years in prison. (Not allowed to be a politician after that)
ARREST → ESCORT → ARRAIGN → IMPRISON

Then, the MILITIA may have to TELL THE POLICE TO STEP ASIDE, SO THEY DON’T GET THEMSELVES SHOT. 
The police may hold their hands up OR put up resistance, but explain to them that SOMEONE IS BREAKING THE 
LAW and the country needs an ACTUAL PROFESSIONAL to PERFORM LAW ENFORCEMENT.

If they try to wave you off anyway, that’s when people start aiming their weapons, and then that dude, if 
he knows any better, he will step aside, or they will step aside. Smartest decision they can make at this point. 
We don’t want these guys to get hurt over (1) lousy politician that’s BREAKING THE LAW and ACCEPTING BRIBERY.
Right...? Once you say those words out loud, they realize “...I thought...”

Then you just restate what you said, “You thought wrong. Someone is going to prison.”
“We are here to escort them to an arraignment with an actual judge that isn’t able to be bribed.”
"@)

$Book.AddSection(2,"Non-Peaceful Resolution",@"
If they really are that fuckin’ stupid enough to grab their weapons, or like try to arrest you... 
FIRE A WARNING SHOT. That’ll fuckin’ get them to realize that you’re not actually breaking the law.

Because they can actually be [placed under arrest at that moment for getting in the way]. 
Pretty fuckin’ stupid reason to [be arrested] and [lose your ability to be a police officer from that point 
forward], because that’s basically [obstructing an arrest]. 

So like, if the police wanted to arrest me as a civilian, but a police officer was preventing anybody from 
coming into my house, they can arrest that dude for getting in the way. Same exact concept.

They can be charged, I don’t know the exact charge, but it may actually be a felony also.
Not unlike RESISTING ARREST. If they wanna arrest YOU, for something or whatever... they can make shit up. 
They often do.

Because if they try to arrest a MILITIA using their CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, to ARREST SOMEBODY LIKE A 
POLITICIAN ACCEPTING BRIBERY, ask the military how they handle a situation like that. That cop will go to an 
actual brig, and he’ll realize that the MILITIA might have a LOT more compassion, than the dipshit he was 
protecting... when they just kick him lose instead of rolling his fingers to get finger prints, and taking a 
mugshot even though he’s still in his uniform... 
Yeah, eventually they’ll realize that it makes NO FUCKING SENSE.

This situation, there’s a LEGAL REASON for this MILITIA to be doing what it’s doing.
They’re seeking accountability.

If they persist on commencing with a FIREFIGHT, then (INSIST ON SHOOTING THEM IN A NONFATAL LOCATION).
Firing a weapon at a MILITIA MEMBER carries the same exact sentence as shooting an actual military soldier or 
police officer. That’s a fuckin’ felony for sure.

Chances are, they won’t put up much of a fight if you have a DECENT MILITIA THAT THE CONSTITUTION ALLOWS. 
If they keep shooting...? SHOOT TO KILL. (← Non-peaceful resolution | LEAST DESIRED OUTCOME)

The thing is, none of these MILITIA SOLDIERS are going to be LESS PREPARED than the POLICE. 
When I say the LITERAL EQUIVALENT OF AN ACTUAL UNITED STATES MILITARY SOLDIER, it is no exaggeration at all.
They will probably not put up a fight, and if they are that fuckin’ stupid, they will be OUTMATCHED, EVERY TIME.
I say PROBABLY, because, there might be some idiots out there that know they are ALSO going to prison...
"@)

$Book.AddSection(2,"Excerpt [+] Constitutional Guarantees",@"
Here’s the situation. I realize plenty of people are gonna read all of that, and they’re gonna say 
“Wait a second... the Constitution says all that shit...?” Yeah. It does. 
Read it sometime. Most people haven’t.

Because, YOU AREN’T LOOKING TO KILL PEOPLE → YOU WANT SOMEONE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR COMMITTING A CRIME.

The militia is seeking accountability.
So, theoretically, Ted Cruz doesn’t need to be shot by anybody. Neither do the police. NOBODY needs to be shot.
Someone’s BREAKING THE LAW and that’s why they get a lot of money from SOMEWHERE, whereby making it...
...DIFFICULT on the rest of SOCIETY. (← that is why these mass murders and shooting sprees occur | indirectly)

Take that source of revenue away, relinquish all of that money they were given, it’s sorta like taking
back control LEGALLY. Free money for everybody. Essentially, it’s like Sonic the Hedgehog, hitting the end of 
the level, and releasing all of the animals trapped in the egg. But, obviously with some complications.

Typically, for a MILITIA to be taken SERIOUSLY, it needs to have enlisted a large number of EXISTING OFFICERS
OF THE LAW, or CURRENT/FORMER MILITARY, and needs to be WELL PREPARED.

That doesn’t mean that a dude who was handed a fat stack of cash ILLEGALLY, can just hire a group of guys
and give them all equipment and such... Nah, all these guys in the MILITIA have to AGREE that they see some
TYRANNY and OPPRESSION.

If someone like Ted Cruz, for example, is arrested by the MILITIA, that means that all of that money he 
has... can be CONFISCATED.
As well as his PROPERTY. Or POSSESSIONS. Idk, depending.

The people that WILL wind up getting shot, are the people that think that their orders are gonna matter, 
OVER a Constitutional Militia. (← Some of them are gonna find out the hard way what the constitution says)

Once police officers hear a superior officer provide an order to PROTECT A POLITICIAN THATS COMMITTING A 
FUCKING CRIME... they’re gonna realize how fuckin’ pointless their existence is, to follow that order.

Realistically, ANYBODY could also have some sense talked into them by stating what I’ve already stated above...
Uvalde, Texas : 19 kids and 2 teachers, shot to death. 
Buffalo, New York : 10 adults shot to death.

--- This list will fuckin’ go on for a while... ---

Some of these people don’t realize that the REASON why this is a UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ONLY issue...
Or, should I say, it happens mostly in America for a VERY KEY SPECIFIC REASON THAT PEOPLE ARE OVERLOOKING...
I will explain what that reason is. 
People may ASSUME that there’s NO WAY I could be correct about the reason...                        (← FALLACY ALERT)
...but the reason is that the BRITISH MONARCHY has basically REIMPORTED BRITISH RULE.
^ It’s pretty complicated, it’s not a thing I can state in a single sentence.

I’m going to talk a lot about FALLACIES in this document, and they need to be READILY IDENTIFIED and 
DISASSEMBLED WHEN THEY ARE DETECTED, however they are part of a larger scope of PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION

$Book.AddSection(3,"Start",@"
Psychological Manipulation is an understanding of how psychology and manipulation work in conjunction, to 
achieve a particular goal or outcome. It is by far one of the most advanced tools a person can have a BASIC 
or THOROUGH understanding of, though it will require a lot of conditioning and study, in order to have a great 
degree of control with it. It will actually be scattered in bits and pieces throughout this entire book. 
"@)

$Book.AddSection(3,"Overview",@"
(PM) is quite an extraordinary way to “control” people, and it is so fucking powerful, that simply writing words 
in a document can cause some of the most powerful people on the planet, to take notice. 
Making this statement will immediately gain the interest of people who ALSO use it. 

Society causes the average person to make many ASSUMPTIONS and ASSERTIONS that most people OVERLOOK.
That is because many things are HIDDEN in PLAIN SIGHT. Sometimes they’re even called COGNITIVE BLIND SPOTS.

In my case, no one really “TAUGHT” me these vital skills, I learned them all on my own.
I know that what I’m about to cover is far from COMPLETE...? But it’ll be a good start.

MANIPULATION probably sounds like it is a BAD thing. 
However EDUCATION is a form of MANIPULATION, and so is COMEDY. 
MANIPULATION is a key component of PSYCHOLOGY, as SOCIETY typically CONDITIONS itself to IGNORE things that 
are HIDDEN in PLAIN SIGHT. 

For instance, if Ted Cruz (senator from Texas), ACCEPTS BRIBERY from Exxon Mobil, what is the senator providing 
in exchange...? One can safely assume that maybe he might spread his ass cheeks, and allow Exxon Mobil to drill 
him square in the rectum. Then again, maybe Ted’s above that, and doesn’t actually spread his ass cheeks at all.

Maybe Exxon Mobil does that and I might be quite a dick to have to consider the various colorful metaphors for 
how he gets paid.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(3,"Explanation",@"
The end result here is, none of those questions really matter so much as the PRINCIPLE of a senator, being 
BRIBED, but also, in the same exact way that WikiLeaks leaked a classified video “Collateral Murder”, the 
PRINCIPLE of CENSORING that video, is that SOMEONE in the MILITARY was committing a heinous OFFENSE, and 
CLASSIFYING the content of the video. 

When it is found that a United States (CITIZEN/CIVILIAN) is being CENSORED in the same fashion, then the 
PARTIES who commit these OFFENSES may actually be considered INSANE, as they are typically choosing to use 
this tool to MASQUERADE CRIMINAL BEHAVIORS that ARE NOT BEING ENFORCED BY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM.

Depending on the (SEVERITY/SERIOUSNESS) of CENSORSHIP, ANY PARTY has CENSORED THE EXPRESSION of ANOTHER PARTY,
particularly (ORGANIZATION/POLITICIAN/WEALTHY PERSON) → ANY CITIZEN, that MAY QUALIFY AS TREASON

THAT IS AGAINST THE LAW and it is a CAPITAL OFFENSE to do this. 
If PROVEN, it may be punishable by the following:
    __________________________________________________________________
    | IMPRISONMENT | STATE-ISSUED EXECUTION by MILITARY FIRING SQUAD |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I think that there are several levels to PROVE that this is happening BEFORE it gets to that point.

Doesn’t just go from (1) incident to → EXECUTION, typically this is after a SERIES of incidents that nobody
was enforcing or stopping. So, FACEBOOK may have a system of CENSORSHIP in place that needs to be DISASSEMBLED.
 
MILITARY censoring the content of an OPERATION, MAY NOT NECESSARILY meet the condition of TREASON, however.

Censorship ranges in SEVERITY, as stated earlier within the document.
It is within the power of the MILITARY or certain FEDERAL AGENCIES to (CLASSIFY/CENSOR) certain operations... 
as those operations may be COMPLEX and require SECURITY CLEARANCES in order to be BRIEFED.

However, CLASSIFICATION may be used to CONCEAL CRIMINAL BEHAVIORS, or UNAUTHORIZED OPERATIONS.
These various forms of CENSORSHIP are often used to commit heinous CAPITAL OFFENSES against it’s own
citizens. THAT- immediately meets the grounds for TREASON against the United States of America, itself.

Even IF a PRESIDENT (former/current), were to meet the grounds for TREASON, they may also be legally EXECUTED.
Because that’s such a serious offense, that you’d have to be a total dumbass to do such a thing.

The SECRET SERVICE will definitely not allow that, as their mission is to fuckin’ stand in the way 
of bullets for these people, regardless of the circumstances. However, when shown that they’re protecting a
TREASONIST, they’re supposed to stand down immediately. (← Will need to research more about their rules)
    
Because then it stands to REASON, that the SECRET SERVICE may have a BRITISH MONARCHY vibe to it.

Some of those conditions are literally written in the fuckin’ Constitution. Maybe not literally, but it meets 
the same criteria of the Declaration of Independence. It’s like “Hey, fuckface... suck a fuckin’ dick, bro.”

$Book.AddSection(3,"Identification",@"
The PROBLEM here, happens to be how SOME people can get away with CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR, while OTHERS cannot.

The end result is:
    19 kids and 2 teachers get killed in a school in Uvalde, Texas
    10 adults get killed in a grocery store in Buffalo, New York...

...the “experts” don’t know how to stop any of this, and the problem continues to evolve and is never resolved.
_______________________________________________________________________
| Q : How do you know that is what’s causing these mass shootings...? |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Because some of these people will attempt to tell others, that I must be insane to write this document.
I’m clearly identifying the problem, AND how to resolve it. I’m also expecting plenty of RESISTANCE.
Otherwise, there will be thousands of more incidents where anybody’s kid goes to school, TOO... But then, 
some deranged lunatic killed 30 more people. 

(^ Stopping this needs to be a COLLABORATIVE + CONCIOUS EFFORT)

But clearly, [I must be the insane one*]...                           (← REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY*/SARCASM)
...to suggest that it’s because the government is compromised.
Clearly, [I must be the one out of my mind*] to suggest that Ted Cruz’s life is A LOT LESS IMPORTANT...
...than 19 kids and 2 teachers. 

I’m not suggesting that dude needs to be (SHOT/KILLED) at all, but he is committing a crime...
...that isn’t being enforced at all. 
There is A LOT OF THIS GOIN ON ALL OVER THE PLACE...                        (← “Absolute power corrupts absolutely.”)

For instance... 
If I tell a police officer “Somebody tried to murder me.” and that police officer doesn’t take action...? 
It’s because, APPARENTLY, you have to fuck his (girlfriend/wife) FIRST.                           (← TOTALLY SERIOUS)
Cause, (he/she) is ignoring their duty.            (← If it’s a SHE then fuck HER, see how she fuckin’ likes THAT...)

If this happens, do whatever necessary to make that woman provide CONSENT, to have sex with her...   (← VERY SERIOUS)
...and then repeatedly make this bitch scream and violently orgasm at the same time...     (← Don’t be MEAN about it)
...cause the police officer isn’t doin’ his job... 
...this strategy is A LOT better, than having to convince (him/her) OTHERWISE. 

They may take offense to this strategy, or find it otherwise “difficult to believe”.        (← They really shouldn’t)
So, that’s when and where PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION has to be used, in order to (IDENTIFY/DERIVE) INTENT.
INTENT: a declaration or directive, following an order, or a specific moral/ethical constraint or principle.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(3,"Why having a WELL (EQUIPPED/TRAINED) MILITIA is a NECESSITY",@"
Here’s a visualization of INTENT, as well as how to MANIPULATE several organizations simultaneously:
Breakdown: Hidden Government/Serial killers/USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001/PEGASUS/PHANTOM → 

(1) they kill target they’ve been watching?   SCSO/NYSP saw that.  Good, got rid of the target.    Target gone
(2) target they’ve been watching kills them?  SCSO/NYSP saw that.  Target goes to prison for life  Target jail
(3) target they’ve been watching kills them?  SCSO/NYSP saw that.  but 5-10 officers went missing  Target good
(4) target they’ve been watching kills them?  SCSO/NYSP saw that.  but 50+  officers went missing  Target good
(5) target they’ve been watching kills them?  FBI saw that.        Gave target a job.              Target great
(6) target they’ve been watching kills them?  Military saw that.   <unspecified>                   <unspecified>
(7) target goes dark, <unspecified>           CIA/FBI/Military ?   Took command.

Over the course of this document, I will provide a clear outline on how to get [JULIEN ASSANGE] released from 
prison, and have [EDWARD SNOWDEN] exonerated. But also, there will be an “integrity check” all across the board. 
Everyone in every single government agency will be put through an “integrity check”, as well as every law, and 
every public official.

Passing an integrity check means that they never have a fuckin’ thing to worry about.         (← Peaceful resolution)
Failing an integrity check means that party will go missing for a key reason, regardless.           (← <unspecified>)

I can tell you right now, failing an integrity check is grounds for termination.                    (← <unspecified>)
“Can you hear me now...? Good.” -Verizon
I’ll state this right now, that doesn’t mean that everybody’s gettin’ shot or whatever. Nah.
TERMINATION means EMPLOYMENT NO LONGER NECESSARY, and probably cause THEY FINALLY WENT TO PRISON...   (← <specified>)

I know that some people are reading all of this and thinking “Wow. This is... very meticulously thought out.”
I know it is. I recorded a video of (2) serial killers in the middle of using Pegasus/Phantom to try and kill 
me on (05/25/20 2343 → 05/26/20 0004)...? THEN, they started CHASING me. THEN, I dialed 911 but nobody was 
answering. THEN, they almost ran me over cause they had 2x vehicles parked in coincidental locations. 
THEN, I almost got arrested... Once I survived all of ^ THAT...? THEN, I later showed the video to my KIDS, 
and NYS Trooper Leavey... and (5) minutes after I showed that dude the video...? 
My smartphone was remotely disabled.
That’s when I realized, time to start thinking like ^ that. 

I know what I have seen, and I expect that I can never let my guard down ever again.
Not unless I’ve got a partner named Bubba, and back to back- sleeping in the rain, neither one of us are gonna 
be sleepin’ in the mud.

Sometimes, in order to be considered a credible threat to CERTAIN people (not ALL people, but- CERTAIN people), 
it is incredibly important to remind them that they WILL be EXECUTED at some point, because they’re murderers.

Once you state these things repeatedly, then what happens is that you are MANIPULATING them in the SAME EXACT WAY   
that MacDuff manipulates Macbeth in the William Shakespeare play Macbeth. 
CERTAIN people will aggressively censor you in every way possible.                                (← CAPITAL OFFENSE) 
-------------------------------------------    ------------------

Because, the problem is fourfold.
(1) federal government knowingly allows SOME criminal behaviors to PERSIST, and does NOT enforce those laws
(2) hidden government has seemingly complete control over the federal government
(3) they hire actual contractors and serial killers to kill people in America and abroad
(4) they will actually laugh about it when people call me psychotic, because they know that I’m correct

I am stating this, right here, right now... 
...the Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office facilitated an attempted murder alongside (2) serial killers, by using 
a tool named PEGASUS/PHANTOM on May 25th-26th 2020, (SCSO-2020-028501) 

Most of the agency has no idea I’m NOT making that up, they think I’m a deranged, delusional, lunatic.
However, Michael Zurlo knows I am 100% accurate, and has been unable to be reached for comment.

$Book.AddSection(3,"Practice and Conditioning",@"
People will attempt to use PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION to cause someone to DOUBT THEMSELVES, or SOMEONE ELSE.
Those who understand the core basic concepts involved in establishing BASE REALITY CERTAINTY... 
...will never be wrong, in terms of judging a person’s character or likelihood of doing something.

In other words, being able to PREDICT the actions of another (PERSON/ENTITY), can be mapped to a 100% certainty.

Therefore, the tricks that work on 95-99% of the population, stop working on the average citizen who follows 
this advice. The key is, to stop judging people based on their: PERSONALITY, REPUTATION, or APPEARANCE.

This is really the main aspect of this entire chapter. Failure to do this, may result in being back-stabbed.
PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION requires a sense of BASE REALITY CERTAINTY in order to be aggressively successful 
with it.

Because I’ve established BASE REALITY CERTAINTY, it is a LOT more fuckin’ difficult, to fool someone like me.
That doesn’t mean it doesn’t still happen from time to time, but I assert the notion:

How is that done? Well, trust is a lot more difficult to hand out, when you EXPECT that people will “crack”.

Many people will disappoint you if they “crack”, or even by making promises they can’t keep.
Therefore, people have to EARN my trust, rather than for me to openly provide it FIRST.

I also will not ALLOW myself to PROVIDE that TRUST, until some amount of TIME has gone by... 
...and I’ve been able to make MANY OBSERVATIONS → those OBSERVATIONS reveal a PATTERN that I CAN trust.

In other words, it’s a pretty meticulous process.
Just because I may find somebody TRUSTWORTHY does not mean they will PERMANENTLY REMAIN that way. 
It also doesn’t mean that if they break (1) promise after I’ve decided to trust them, that it’s all over.
Not gonna be like “Well, you promised me you were gonna come over after work, so we could hang out.”
Nah, cause sometimes people make promises they can’t keep because they’re OVERPROVISIONING.
That’s basically like not preparing to have contingencies in place.

Yeah, I’ll automatically provide people with contingencies if they are 1) traveling, or 2) working.
Sometimes I will even state that I trust somebody to make additional observations about how they act.
But, lets say it’s some girl that had to go to work, and promised me she would wanna get together after work.
WELL, it’s a pretty good opportunity to use reverse psychology actually, rather than getting upset cause...

1) “oOoOoOOOOhhhHHhh, you PrOmIsEd Me ThAt YoU aNd I wOuLd HaNg OuT aFtEr YoU gOt OuT oF wOrK...” (← Don’t do that.)
   (^ this is:       needy,      clingy,  annoying, NOT a real good look, guy from Mens Warehouse would agree)

2) You could say “FINE. I’ll hang out with some other girl(s) instead, then.”                     (←       do that.)
   (^ this  is: independent, has options, confident,    a real good look, guy from Mens Warehouse would agree)

You can actually apply this concept to people in general. As long as you’re conveying a sense of indifference,
instead of having your whole life appear ruined because someone BAILED on you, then you’ll be good.

But if it becomes a pattern, try to put some distance in between, because they may need the space. Nobody ever
says “I think we need some space” until it’s way past that point. On the other hand, don’t be wicked distant and
then take (3) weeks to text or call someone back. Cause, then where the hell are ya...?
^ Anyway, trusting people...

If someone is attempting to PRESSURE me into making a decision, I have to consider multiple responses.
    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    | Time known                  | Trustworthiness/Pattern | Response                                     |
    |=============================|=========================|==============================================|
    | very long time              | Definitely trust them   | I will FEEL a sense of urgency/danger        |
    | moderate length of time     | typically forthright    | Delay, process, sort of indifferent          |
    | short length of time        | Nah                     | I will say “Suck a fuckin’ dick, bro.”       |
    | never heard of at all       | Nah                     | I might actually fuck with them.             |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
People that know I trust them, will know I won’t SAY that, and they won’t violate that at all. 
People that I “say” that I trust, won’t know WHY... they’ll just assume that I do, and it’s whatever to them.
^ There is a difference between the two.

PATTERNS are easier to trust, than people (← Core critical concept here, in establishing BASE REALITY CERTAINTY)
PATTERNS are pretty fuckin’ easy to detect when you actually remain observant of your surroundings and the 
activity of other people. When I was at the Saratoga County Jail, a volunteer firefighter who works in 
Clifton Park, identified himself as a THREAT. Here’s how the PATTERN evoked itself... 
    - I told this guy my name, then he STOOD UP, walked away a few feet, and then strangely came back.
    - I had a ringing in my ear when he did that
    - that is my sense of intuition telling me that he was involved in that event on May 26th, 2020 SOMEHOW.

That doesn’t necessarily mean that my HUNCH is correct, because, I could be incorrect about that, 
HOWEVER, it fell within a spectrum of PLAUSIBILITY, and I don’t ignore something like that.
I don’t really ASK PEOPLE FOR PERMISSION to have a hunch about somebody either, nor do I ADVERTISE it...
...unless of course I don’t give a shit whether they know or not.

Me  : Hey, buddy.

Me  : You know, I think you’re doin’ somethin’ mad shady...
Guy : Me...?
Me  : Yeah, you.
Guy : Well, why...?
ME  : I dunno buddy. 
      Givin’ me the creeps.
Guy : *shakes head* Buddy, take it easy.
Me  : I’m not even getting myself wound up, I’m just casually sayin’ it.
Guy : Well, now I think YOU’RE doin’ somethin’ mad shady...
Me  : Nah, my life is an open book, bro.
      I’m writin’ it...?
      You’re readin’ it.
      It is what it is.
Guy : That is very vague bro.
Me  : I saw the way you just stood up, after I said my name.
Guy : Yeah...?
      I ALWAYS stand up after somebody tells me their name...

Me  : Fine.

Sometimes just having this type of conversation with someone you suspect will really fuck with them.
Like, SCSO Deputy Pirrone... He knows, we sorta had a conversation just like this once upon a time.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me      : Hey, do you do any actual WORK around here...? 
          Or, do you just STAND there for your entire shift...
          ...with the fuckin’ phone on your shoulder...
          ...do nothing...?
Pirrone : Listen pal, *taps chest* MY fuckin whole life is difficult, alright...?
          I gotta stand here, and wait for somebody to come to the phone.
          You ever had a job doin’ that...?
Me      : Yeah, it’s why I got myself a headset.
          Get yourself one of THOSE dude... then you can actually be productive WHILE being on the phone.
Pirrone : Bro...

...the reason I was fucking with this dude, is because I had this SUSPICION that he was involved in the 
attack on (05/25/20 2343 → 05/26/20 0130) SOMEHOW. So, I was tryin’ to let him know that I think he’s lazy.
It actually worked. 

Cause then he asked DJ Thompson why I was even there, and then he said “Captains kids, Farm to Market road” 

Which, believe it or not, that’s how these guys gave me ACTUAL CLUES. 
You wouldn’t think that a police officer or (2) would blab about CLUES...
...if they’re committing OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE...?

But, they thought that I was a moron. 
They didn’t realize, I’m a lot smarter than they are.

PLAUSIBILITY: You’ve detected a pattern that is unmistakably INDICATIVE, of a POSSIBILITY that a THEORY is 
accurate. For instance, if I write a number of things about my former employer, DANIEL PICKETT, is it PLAUSIBLE 
that strange things occur on my computer, as a RESULT of that...?

PERSONALITY: People have one, it is composed of their:

    A) social status    | A`) properties of social status
    B) appearance       | B`) properties of appearance
    C) morals           | C`) properties of morals
    D) behaviors        | D`) properties of behaviors
    E) predictability   | E`) properties of predictability

Here’s a mathematical way to look at someone’s personality, but as a formula...

P = ((A * 100)/A`)/((B * 100)/B`)/((C * 100)/C`)/((D * 100)/D`)((E * 100)/E`))
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
               ((A`+B`+C`+D`+E`) * etc.

I didn’t go to Harvard or anything, I’m not likely to expand this right now, but if I really put some thought 
into making this something I could count on, I would make the time to do that. Pretty sure that the FBI and 
Government have something like this... But there’s a far simpler method than using math.

The take away from this illustration here, is that- every one of those aspects has a 0 to 100 value. 
They are all very critical in being able to TRUST somebody and take them at their word.

The EASIEST conclusion ANYONE can make without putting a lot of fuckin’ thought to it, is that most people
may or may not know when they’re talking out of their ass. In other words, EFFORT and ACCURACY equate to TRUST

When people try to provide me with: [FALSE ASSURANCES*] or [FALLACIOUS STATEMENTS*]
Those are IMMEDIATE RED FLAGS. Once I detect an IMMEDIATE RED FLAG, I’m going to TARGET YOU with 
MANIPULATIVE STRATEGIES. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1MpqD7AmxYA1IoAZHfsA3tZ_xwTGRwPPY

This link above, directly references an interaction I had with SCSO CAPTAIN/INVESTIGATOR JEFFREY BROWN.

In this PARTICULAR sample, I had no idea that I would have to start talking to actual police officers with some 
of the aggressive strategies that I have. The beginning of the call, I had no suspicion toward him at all. 

Then at some point in the call, he gets a call on the other line. 
When he comes back...? SUDDENLY, he knows some shit about the FBI, NSA, CIA... Ah. 
The WAY he rattled off those agencies, caused me to feel as if I was being ridiculous. 
I knew that I wasn’t being ridiculous at all, I was right on point, and he was using a DIVERSION tactic. (PM)

Consider that the CIA will have things that fool most people all the time. 
They actually study the human psyche to determine where their COGNITIVE BLIND SPOTS are. 
They will take full advantage of those COGNITIVE BLIND SPOTS, because they layer sophisticated tools... 
...in with things that 99% of the human population will never be intelligent enough to detect. 

And guys like this dude in this recording...? I hate to say it, but if he wasn’t actually ACTING...? 
Then this dude totally missed some vital clues.

Someone called him while I was on the line, to talk SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ME. Not too different from when I called
Stratton Air National Guard back on October 20th, 2020. I was talking to a guy, the call was interrupted (4) 
times, and each time I thought “Someone is listening to this conversation I’m having with him...”

The bottom line is this... Once you are like ME, and you expect ANY POSSIBLE LINK or RELATION AT ALL, then each
time someone says “HANG ON, GOT A CALL ON THE OTHER LINE”, well, I suspect that the person on the other line is
providing new instructions to the person I’m talking to. (← Once you detect this, you are a lot harder to fool)

There are a NUMBER of questionable reactions that JEFF BROWN had with me, in that particular phone call. 

If I have to state the obvious here, I had to change my strategies over the entirety of that phone call. 
Most people, will listen to it and have no fuckin’ clue, what techniques this guy was using. Nah. 
Morons can’t tell intent from vocal signatures... I’m not callin’ this guy a moron, either.

However, things such as this, make it a SERIOUS PROBLEM for me to OPENLY GIVE PEOPLE the benefit of a doubt. 
Really, giving people the benefit of a doubt is something that SOCIETY trains people to do. 
But, you really have to work god damn hard to balance THAT with not being a total asshole.

Because at any moment this guy could’ve said “OoOOOoooHhhHh DRONES DISGUISED AS BIRDS”...
...cause he DID do that. But- I’ve obtained additional clues that tell me I’m just being more observant than
most other people. Most people won’t actually listen to the recordings. They will FINALIZE their decision,
BEFORE listening to the audio/video. And, guess what sorts of people do that...?

...morons. Because if what I recorded is something A LOT MORE SOPHISTICATED than a REGULAR, ordinary bird...?
Then, it fools everyone really easily. That’s what makes it so fucking dangerous, actually. Or, helpful.

Anyway, now I fuckin’ know what the problem is in every direction. Wasn’t like I was an arrogant dickhead 
my whole life, people forced me to adopt these lines of reasoning that most people would never think to 
consider. Once you consider that there IS a a MALICIOUS ENTITY that’s DOIN’ SOMETHIN’ SOMEWHERE, EVERY HOUR 
OF THE DAY, EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY HOUR... [PATTERNS become easier to trust]. And, the recordings of the BIRD,
they have PATTERNS in them. Not normal bird patterns either. 

More like “Cool, so this thing sounds like ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.” https://youtu.be/zXkmxtYQ6wQ

I have no fuckin’ doubt in my mind that Jeff Brown had NOTHING TO DO with what happened to me on 05/26/20.

However, he found the record that I was LOOKING FOR in my FOIL REQUEST back on SEPTEMBER 4th, 2020.
I didn’t get that particular record, SCSO-2020-028501, but to state what happened: 
“MALE RUNNING IN FRONT OF CAR AT ZAPPONE” (← this was 90+ minutes after I called 911 already TWICE)

...AND cut Zackary Karel’s fuckin phone line, cause the douchebags were in HIS HOUSE. Yeah. 
The guys that were trying to kill me... in that dudes’ fuckin’ house. 
That’s how stupid James Leonard is. 

Zackary Karel was stalking me with his drone, and I really don’t understand why. I am SPECULATING that he was 
doing this, but this dude was readin’ my Facebook posts somehow... Wasn’t even friends with him on Facebook, 
how’s this dude readin’ my profile...? Oh. It’s cause I’ve been manipulating people through Facebook, actually. 

Then, because my phone had issues contacting 911 emergency services, I started running at cars on the road 
trying to flag people down for fuckin’ help cause I knew I was gonna get myself killed if I went in 
ANY UNLIT AREA. 

Why did I think that...? Cause I saw fuckin’ footprints in the snow over the last several months, that I didn’t 
fuckin’ leave there, someone was TAILING ME through the woods with a HUGE FUCKIN’ DOG. THIS was OCCASIONALLY
happening in TANDEM of an event where some guy driving a BLUE TRUCK, on CEMETERY ROAD, would pull into a 
driveway, stare at me for a moment, and then just, take off, back the way he came.

Not like “Oh shit, I gotta turn around... fuck.” Cause that would’ve been VERY CLEAR, 
But rather, knowing I was on that road *somehow*, pulling into a driveway. Staring at me. No indication that 
he’s doing anything else, looking at me almost exactly like the (2) dudes that have Christian Ortega/NoDoze 
killed in Breaking Bad. Basically fucking identical.

So, these things all fit into a PATTERN, but the PATTERN didn’t make sense because I hadn’t YET figured out 
HOW that dude was tracking me. Regardless, here’s how I knew I was actively being hunted back in May 2020... 

On 05/19/20, I had an altercation with my stepfather because, I told him about what I just fuckin’ said 
about the blue truck, and I told my loving caring stepfather that I was afraid someone was, how should I put 
it, making it pretty fucking clear that they were marking me to be killed. Why...? Well, I’m sure I know WHY 
if someone wasn’t such a bitch about it, and explained to me that they fuckin’ hear everything everybody says, 
and they say nothing... cause... that’s how some people are (I’ll get back to manipulating people with insults 
in a moment). 

The altercation resulted from me: tellin my stepfather “I think I’m gonna go missing and never be found.” and 
then my stepfather started laughing at me profusely. Ah. Well, dad... *that’s why I broke my fuckin’ right hand
assaulting you*

Because, that’s what I’m gonna do to MY kid, right...? “Dad, I’m worried that someone’s gonna KILL me...”
“Oh, wow, kid you’re fuckin hilarious. Wow LOL.”
Cause I would understand if my son decided to assault me for that too.

After Agresta/Lyons/Hildreth came to the house, they took a report, and they knew that my stepfather was 
drinking, cause he’s a raging alcoholic and a real miserable prick. Not really helpful for much... 
Critiques everything I do, but, when he’s being a lazy cocksucker, it’s ok for him to do that. Cool. 
I hate this prick sometimes.

| 05/19/20 | 911 Call | 60 → 30 Sitterly Road, Clifton Park, NY 12065 |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
SCSO Anthony Agresta suggested that I take off for the night, so I did. But, (2) events happened.
(1) : I walked to my friends apartment in Twin Lakes, he wasn’t home. I had a feeling that the person in the 
truck was TRACKING ME with my iPhone because, I occasionally thought about THAT, and left it at home sometimes, 
and I NEVER saw the blue truck when I did THAT... Basically, a dead fucking giveaway. 
“PLAUSIBLE THEORY MICHAEL C. COOK... CONTINUE...”

So...? I had a GUT FEELING, that if I just fuckin’ passed out with the phone on me, I was gonna get fuckin’
stabbed to death in my sleep. Well...? I decided “Why don’t I just call 911...?” That’s what I did. After it
initialized the call, I immediately shut the device off. Kept walking. Didn’t think anything of it. 

Had a feeling I’d still be tracked, even if I turned that device off. And, like fuckin’ magic actually, 
there’s a cop. Just passed me... he saw me, he’s, about to pull up to me now, isn’t he...? *vehicle stops* 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Agresta : Hey, buddy. *chewin’ his gum probably*
Me      : Hey man. 
          Sup...?
Agresta : *chewing gum, making the moment take a little longer* Did ya call 911...?
Me      : (Yeah) Nah. 
          Not me man.
Agresta : *chewing gum* You sure...? 
          From like a, phone with no service...?
Me      : (Yeah) Nah man. 
          You don’t recognize me...?
Agresta : *squints* Are you that guy who was at that house in Halfmoon Heights...?
Me      : Yeh. 
          That’s me.
Agresta : Oh wow, how the heck did ya get here so fast...? *chewing gum*
Me      : Bro, I can teleport. 
          I’m like Goku, basically. 
          Got a little cloud named Nimbus... 
          Fucks shit up, too.
Agresta : C’mon bro. 
          You can’t be Goku...
Me      : Nah, you’re right, I’m not. 
          I just... 
          ...walk real fast man. (It’s cause I cut through the woods a lot)
Agresta : Hey man... 
          ...you need anythin’ or... 
          ...you alright...?
Me      : (Yeah) Nah I’m good. 
Agresta : *chewing gum* Alright... 
          *eyebrow up* You’re sure now..? 
Me      : Yeh I’m... 
          I’m (not) good.
Agresta : Alright buddy. 
          Take it easy.*him and another cop take off*

About a minute or two later, 
...[ there is this cocksucker in his blue truck, pulling out of Sitterly/Corporate Drive ]...

Side note: No more than a quarter mile away from Trickshot Billiards/Computer Answers/Catricala Funeral Home.

So, that was EVENT (1) that night. WICKED SUSPICIOUS, TERRIFIED, NOBODY GIVES A SHIT, except the dude that I 
couldn’t actually tell the truth to, because I was testing a theory. Now, I didn’t know that the truck would 
be following Anthony Agresta, but man... I found out THAT PARTICULAR NIGHT, that...
...[ someone was definitely scheduling to kill my ass ].

The (2nd) event, I walked all the way to Shenendehowa, I thought for some moronic reason, that maybe I could 
stay alive with the device on me if I was somewhat near a monitored property where I’d have some VISIBILITY...

...of someone trying to get me or whatever... 
When I got there, I laid in the grass near the electric sign on 146. 
Then like, IDK man, black clouds following me all over the place, about 2-3 minutes goes by, and then suddenly 
there’s a fuckin’ campus patrol vehicle shining it’s flashlight into the Orenda side of Orenda/Karigon. 

Into the windows, like they were looking for a person. A person they might’ve been looking for was like, me. 
I wasn’t anywhere even CLOSE to that building, but- somebody had to check that out. (← this is not the only 
event to take place on Shenendehowa campus)

There’s some fuckin’ CORRELATION between ALL of these incidents and I’m not a fuckin’ idiot.

The thing is, if you have detected SOMETHING SINISTER, don’t wait around and be a little gay kid in a closet 
like some people... they like that closet of theirs, it’s warm, cozy, they can blow their buddies, probably 
great for em. But if you want to be considered a man by any standard, don’t do that. I keep talking shit about 
these people because I don’t really know what else to do, to be fair. 

They have had me in a position where I’ve been scared shitless and I’ll just continue to talk shit to them 
because I’m not gonna waste the opportunity to make fun of them for being as gay as they are, while I know 
what they’re doing....

They don’t like any of that at all, and they wish I wasn’t correct about how gay they are.
Thing is, even if you ARE terrified, your fight or flight response gets engaged, and if you don’t even 
TRY to fight, then you’re the biggest pussy that ever lived, cause they’re gay, not really scary.
The dicks that they swallow, those are probably scary looking. But THEY are not very scary looking at all.

[Chapter - The “Week” will cover (05/19/20 → 05/27/20) with great detail] 
Basically spent that whole time manipulating this security team. 
Because I had a feeling that I know who the hell was driving that truck, and so... I’m going to explain a 
concept AND strategy that nobody will EVER detect, because people that have malicious intent really are this 
gullible and stupid.

I had to consider that CVE-2019-8936 had something to do with Matt Roerig and Nfrastructure. But hey, maybe 
I’m wrong. Still- when I was in elementary school, I had a best friend with a photographic memory named 
Alexander Philipsak. He told me about how he could remember everything with extreme precision. 
I used to think to myself, “That’s probably HIGHLY fuckin’ useful... right...?” 

He tells me, “Nah, it’s kinda shitty actually. Can’t forget stuff. Kinda wish I knew what that felt like.”
I can tell ya that there’s really no way to modify the human psyche to be somewhere in the middle. 
Wanna remember some real hot bitch that you banged the snot out of...? Good. Then you can. 
Wanna forget something real shitty, like, idk, the first girlfriend you ever had that hung herself...? 
Well shit. That was, extremely tragic and I cried FOR this kid. 

He will spend the remainder of his life remembering that like it was just... just happened really. 
Me...? I have to struggle to remember some stuff, but with REPETITION, it can be done.

I imagine, what if SATAN, remembered everything like my buddy. He fuckin’ remembers everything you ever SAID, 
everything you ever DID, how your FARTS probably smelled sometimes, whether you told a GOOD joke versus a 
SHITTY one... this dude will remember ALL of it... why? 
Cause his brain is basically a permanent storage database.

Suppose this dude was a THREAT to me. I am damn certain that HE is not. But, suppose someone ELSE that 
remembers everything just... fuckin’, remembered every little thing. Well, how the hell would you be able to 
confuse someone that remembers EVERYTHING…? Overload them with altering characters. Basically simulating a 
multiple personality disorder.

Acting. Most people never know when someone a lot more intelligent than their ass, is like... acting. 
When I explain “I was acting”, well... the kid that I recorded on VIDEO using this fuckin’ PEGASUS program, 
he... fuckin’ knew right there and then that I was ACTING and I MANIPULATED HIS ASS.

It’s a FLAW in human psychology. They assume that you don’t know what the fuck planet you’re on, cause, 
you’re talkin about Spectrum, Verizon, Class action lawsuits, paying them off with free HBO, taking pictures 
of fiber optic cables, being a general, all-around nuisance, fuckin’ gettin’ in Eric Catricala’s face with
“Investigating Bruce Tanski” and just fuckin’ take off man... 

I WAS actually doing ALL of those things, but- I don’t think people understand WHY
              ____________________________________________________________________________________
              | Note: When people FAIL to understand WHY somebody is doing something...?         |
              | That usually indicates that they may not be intelligent enough to ask questions. |
              ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Not (1) person will know that you’re smarter than all of those people who were like:
“What.. the fuck is up with THIS dude...?” 

Well, I expect that the people who run this shadow organization that is the HIDDEN GOVERNMENT, that they’re 
fuckin’ elusive for a reason. But, that’s cause they haven’t met someone INTELLIGENT enough to:
                               ___________________________________________________

                               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I’m gonna state this right here and now, someone that’s COOPERATIVE and isn’t acting like a fuckin’ moron...
...it’s gonna be a lot easier for me to trust them. 

When I can detect that there’s a RESISTANCE … I can actually FEEL that, it doesn’t need to be SPOKEN at all... 
...it can just be FELT across TIME and SPACE.                                   (← because of “Quantum Entanglement”)

For every single statement that people say out loud, there is a HASH VALUE, that you can actually detect. 
If you pay close enough attention to the SUBTLETIES of each comment that a person makes...
...YOU CAN IN FACT DERIVE INTENT. 

You may ALSO be able to DERIVE INTENT, from non-actions, like for instance, Michael Zurlo, not calling me back, 
ever. A dude who’s innocent, isn’t gonna pretend like he’s busy for 2 years straight, and ya know, people will 
sound as moronic as Dennis Bruce does in one of the recordings in my ARCHIVE.

So, you can also DERIVE INTENT from telling guys like Trooper Borden, or Trooper Carter, or Captain Shelley 
Zietske, that you happen to have an archive that isn’t being collected. 

That’s usually a dead giveaway that not only do they not really give a shit, but that they’re fuckin’ morons. 
They will literally tell people that I must be insane, right...? 

None of these fucks have collected any of my evidence, and they operate on assumptions. 
That’s why Trooper Carter might be right, his ass probably will get shot someday by a lunatic, cause he can
say that I’m an evil prick that probably hopes that happens, but I don’t.
It’s literally cause he’s not really smart. 
Maybe he is, and I just offended him by having a stack of pictures in one hand, and my smartphone in the other.

Yeah, so, I gain no pleasure from having to restate over and over again:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me : Hey. 
     I’m not insane. 
     I’m smarter than a lot of people. 
     Sorry if I come across as a condescending dickhead sometimes, but hey... 
     ...a lot of people have screwed me over, and they think nothing of it...
     Underestimating me, is about the dumbest thing a person can do.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

But I also have to say that being a fuckin’ idiot, doesn’t mean that they had malicious intentions. 
Like, I truly think that Shelley Zeitske is just a fool who trusts someone she shouldn’t.  
“James Leonard is a good guy...” 

Sure he is. How long have you been an employee at SCSO...? 30 years or some shit...? 
Well, lady... I realize you’re not the problem.

James Leonard handled a ticket for ERIC CATRICALA and ZACKARY KAREL, which means that the two tickets he handled 
were part of the same CRIME that James Leonard and Scott Schelling like... ignored. 

If someone says:
“Yeah, a couple guys were tryin’ to kill me, run me over with their car, I called 911 a couple times on my 
device, took pictures, uploaded them at Computer Answers, etc.” 

Normally a police officer would THINK to take some fuckin’ notes, right...?  Well, think again fuckface. 
Not if you’re ME. Nope. They’re gonna do everything possible to score a SAFETY instead of a TOUCHDOWN.
A SAFETY is when you’re playing FOOTBALL and you’re supposed to RUN TO THE OTHER END OF THE FUCKIN’ FIELD...
...to score a TOUCHDOWN, but you instead say “Fuck that, bro.”, and then you run BACKWARD, and score in the
OPPOSITE DIRECTION... yeah.                                                          (← What the police do sometimes)

Regardless, innocent people: 19 kids and 2 teachers at a school in Uvalde, 
                             10 adults in a grocery store in Buffalo 
...the reason they’re getting killed by random shooting sprees is actually pretty easily resolvable.
...leave the second amendment alone, that’s not the fuckin’ problem.
...people in a community that hesitate to speak up, they need to stop doing that.
...that alone will resolve 95% of these shooting sprees. 

They just won’t happen anywhere, because Saratoga County Mental Health would have a more “meaningful” 
existence, if it actually SEARCHED for those types of people, and reversed their entire structure. 
So for instance, if I needed mental health, I have to get dragged to a fuckin hospital by (3) dudes from 
SCSO who like, were recorded in an audio recording, where I never state anything about hurting myself or 
anybody, BUT THEY FUCKIN HEARD THAT cause they’re morons. 

They’re morons. Even if you record them, they just don’t give a flying fuck. 
They confused words I actually said with somehow I apparently wanted to hurt people and kill the police... 
That’s literally what SCSO does to me. I have an audio recording of them choosing to write something like that 
down in a report that I requested records for and Michael Zurlo prevented the records department from providing 
me with the report. I got the fuckin’ call for service, but I want the fuckin’ report that actually has the
information that the <unspecified> SUSAN MCDERMOTT had in front of her face...
...when she and DR. RICHARD TODD LOEBER sent STEPHEN CONNORS an order to show cause. (← LAWSUIT)

...that is how stupid these people are. If they do this as a team, and fuck everything up in unison...? 
They will actually succeed, no matter how much jizz is dripping off of their faces.                      (← METAPHOR)
As if they could be in 10 places at the same time while appearing to be standing still.         (← EXTENDED METAPHOR)
But- they’re not actually standing still at all, nah. 
They’re the same person moving faster than the speed of light.

Anyway, look. I do not need mental health services. What I need... is to show people, there are SERIAL KILLERS
that are using tools such as PEGASUS/PHANTOM, and they need to be THROWN IN PRISON, OR, <unspecified>.
I don’t go around saying that innocent people deserve to be hurt... Quite the opposite, actually.

Someone VERY DANGEROUS, has a VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL, and if they can prevent ME from calling 911...? AND, I’m 
basically WELL AWARE OF WHAT THEY’RE TRYING TO DO... AND, I barely survived...?  

Then, IMAGINE HOW EASILY THEY CAN KILL PEOPLE THAT HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE THEY ARE BEING TARGETED, WHATSOEVER. 
These guys don’t use BULLETS, or GUNS. They will use “making your death look accidental”, OR, YOU GO MISSING.

Then they 1) WERE, 2) ARE, and 3) WILL CONTINUE TO... use this tool that hacks 100% of people’s smartphones...
...so he can STALK THEM, STAB THEM, BURY THEM, THEN THEY GO MISSING, AND … people think that’s nuts. 

Yeah. It is, but it’s accurate. I HAD* PROOF of it. They’re gonna keep a relatively low profile now that I
keep trying to tell people what they’re doing... They’re gonna drive out of state or all the way up to 
PLATTSBURGH, MONTREAL, BURLINGTON, SYRACUSE, ROCHESTER, BUFFALO, IDK. 
They’re not likely to do this here in TOWN, they’re gonna drive REALLY fuckin’ far.

Imagine if you would, that the guy who shot up TOPS...? 
What if he actually killed THOUSANDS of people...?
And, never actually got caught...?
WELL, that’s EXACTLY what I’m saying.

The reasons why (he/they) would ever manage to SUCCESSFULLY kill THAT MANY PEOPLE is if:
1) (he/they) did that SILENTLY, 
2) everyone thought that idea was absolutely fucking (ridiculous/delusional)
3) (he/they) never drew attention to (himself/themselves),
4) (he/they) had a program that converts ANY TARGET SMARTPHONE into a TRACKING BEACON (PEGASUS/PHANTOM),
5) (he/they) made many of those target’s deaths look ACCIDENTAL, or as if those targets just went MISSING.

In other words, if any STATE TROOPER, COUNTY SHERIFF, or FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR does this thing where they 
comb the entire database of MISSING PEOPLE AND ACCIDENTAL DEATHS from (2014 → now) in a radius of about 
250mi, you now have yourselves a really big list of people that these fucks have probably* successfully 
killed. You can even like FILTER DOWN to which of them OWNED AN APPLE iPHONE.

I mean, allow me to state the obvious here... I’m not gonna kill cops, nor anyone innocent, I’m not going 
to a fuckin’ school and losing my fucking mind and taking it out on a bunch of kids. This motherfucker, 
that I recorded using PEGASUS/PHANTOM...? He’s doing this to a lot of people, and it gets no media coverage 
or attention because... the police really are protecting (him/them). OR, ZURLO/APPLE ARE. Whether that’s 
CRAIG APPLE, or the COMPANY.

They may be UNINTENTIONALLY protecting him, but THEY ARE NOT ALONE. 
They just aren’t smart enough to COLLECT EVIDENCE that he exists alright, that’s why they’re UNINTENTIONALLY 
protecting him. Meanwhile, APPLE the COMPANY, fights RIGHT TO REPAIR, and is worth `$3T and rising... (← WOW)

I don’t know, I have to consider that the police are ALL INVOLVED and they ALL DO IT, given the RESISTANCE
I’ve faced. Might sound ridiculous, but- when people try to tell me that my OBSERVATIONS were DELUSIONS...? 
Nah. I didn’t have a single issue with people calling me DELUSIONAL before I started my company in 2018. Yeah, 
I might’ve gotten into arguments with people. I never ranted and raved about SERIAL KILLERS and MURDERERS, up 
until JOHN PICKETT started watching me exclusively. (← He was involved in my father’s death somehow)

The bottom line is this, people wind up getting killed. Doesn’t really matter how it is DECLARED, but when the
military goes over to Russia, and they’re like, what’s that fuckin’ cocksucker Putin up to, today...? 
Well, they have the right equipment to literally blast him out of existence from space. 
But why don’t they do that...? If they had like an ION cannon, to destroy the entire Kremlin, inside and out, 
it would probably do the whole world a favor, right? But, as far as I know, those don’t exist. I’m being 
facetious here, with the ion cannon.

The people that actually need mental health services, they’re not gonna be anywhere remotely as intelligent as 
I am, they’re probably gonna doubt that the hidden government exists, they’re gonna probably see an action 
figure look at them the wrong way and flip the fuck out... 

Here is the rhetoric of an actual crazy person:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Psycho    : *sees a Donatello action figure* 
Donatello : Fuck you, dude.
Psycho    : WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY...?!?
            I … FUCKIN’ TOTALLY HEARD THAT... 
Donatello : No, ya didn’t.
Psycho    : BRO, *starts pacing angrily* what the hell did I do to YOU, to deserve that...?
Donatello : You’re a moron, bro. 
            Cowabunga, dude.
Psycho    : OMFG … *starts getting REAL pissed*

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Look, that shit is hilarious, but at the same time, that is what goes on in an actual crazy person’s “head”.
I may have some mental disorder, but it is not schizophrenia, it is not bipolar, it is not manic-depressive
it is literally because I have AUTISM. Had highly functioning AUTISM my entire life, and for some reason, 
nobody ever knew or cared... because it’s pretty hard to detect when someone that has AUTISM, isn’t properly 
tested or whatever... right?

But I have a pretty easy solution to prevent that from happening in the future, to OTHER people... 
Tell Ted Cruz to fuckin’ set aside like half of what he makes, since it’s literally illegal for him to do
what he’s doin’, and then spend some of that money on a noble cause, such as: free testing for people that
need it. THEN, you don’t have these MILLIONS OF WILDCARD PEOPLE that might just flip the fuck out and mow
down entire classrooms full of children, teachers, people, concert goers, movie watchers, etc.

Have every (child/person/adult), be located/approached by proactive services that don’t assume things.

Rather than for Ted fuckin’ Cruz, to get like `$500M every time that EXXON MOBIL feels like busting a nut in 
his asshole...? Tell Ted Cruz to use all of that money, to make sure everyone in his jurisdiction gets some 
type of regular contact and testing. I mean, if that sounds complicated, think about how MORE complicated it 
would be, to have another Uvalde Texas every fucking day. 

Pretty sure that’d be fucking alarming, wouldn’t it?

The truth is, it might make more sense to just, kick him out of office, put him in prison and confiscate his 
money, and his possessions, and then, get everybody what they need.

But- there’s a reason why that’s not ALREADY happening, and it leads to these events happening, where 
they are UNABLE TO BE PREVENTED. THEN, people start to IMMEDIATELY BLAME GUN CONTROL, rather than like, 
the fuckin’ douchebags accepting bribery, or the HIDDEN GOVERNMENT.

The truth is, the HIDDEN GOVERNMENT is the reason why that this is happening, they are basically the
BRITISH MONARCHY that somehow overrode America after 1812. They basically got pretty pissed off that they 
had their asses handed to them prior to the war of 1812, that they actually invaded America with full force,
and then they made it all the way to the white house where they took over, and then told everybody to suck
a fuckin’ dick.

They’re so closely involved with everything... and, (MURDOCK/CARLSON/HANNITY/FOX NEWS) is like one of 
their most favorite puppets in the world. They’ve basically re-imported BRITISH rule, without raising 
any eyebrows. And, man. They are merciless... I might be providing an overextended metaphor here, BUT- 
maybe that is EXACTLY what’s goin’ on. 

What I’m sayin’ here, is that BRITAIN- they’re not all BAD PEOPLE. But- the BRITISH MONARCHY...? 
Oh, they’ve held a fuckin’ grudge against America since BEFORE 1776, and EXXON MOBIL is their golden ticket.
They’re fuckin’ demonic sons of bitches man... 
...the queen is forcing* us to do all this stuff, without alarming* anybody... 
Like, Princess Diana... she got into an accident*, right...? Right... (Sarcasm) 

(Prince/Andrew/Cuomo), doesn’t really care for being told how fuckin’ stupid he is. (← Oh well)
Every time I know I’ve pissed off the HIDDEN GOVERNMENT, I hear a ringing in my ear.
The Brits, are the reason why PEGASUS/PHANTOM is so elusive... it being used by the FIVE EYES.

While (Prince/Andrew/Cuomo) is just a normal, regular, every-day-at-the-park type of cocksucker...?
The guy trying to kill me on a video I recorded on 05/26/20 is a cocksucker AND a SERIAL KILLER. 
See, here’s why that SOUNDS REALLY BAD... THE SERIAL KILLER IS NOT A FIGMENT OF MY FUCKING IMAGINATION.
So, I can tell who in SCSO is compromised by reading certain reports, and things of that nature.
DOZENS of cases where somebody said “OoOOOhhHHh Michael Cook is ‘delusional’.” (← INDICATES MALICIOUS INTENT)

Wanna know what people do nothing about, though...? The evidence I recorded, of this demon EXISTING. 
Not just (1) guy, cause it’s him and his brother. They’re a team. But they are part of the HIDDEN GOVERNMENT.
Still hanging onto the evidence... still being called DELUSIONAL by people that think I lost my mind, 
realizing that the system is acting retarded, because they’re protecting this MAIN KID who happens to be:

They either do not BELIEVE he exists, or they just don’t give a shit. (← it can’t be BOTH or NEITHER)
Attempting to have a bunch of puppets try to manipulate ME or force my hand...? 
These tactics, NO LONGER WORK ON ME. However, this takes quite a bit of PRACTICE and CONDITIONING.

People, really are, morons. The truth is, not EVERYBODY happens to be a moron, but it is a SAFE assumption 
to make in EVERY circumstance, UNTIL they prove otherwise. As long as you are able to provide PRESSURE, or 
DETECT when someone is SWITCHING TO OTHER TOPICS (DISTRACTIONS), you can take COMMAND of a conversation. 

People will say HINDSIGHT IS 20/20, that’s because people notice where they fucked up AFTERWARD.

For instance, if I ask someone a question, and they tell me some other thing that’s unrelated, that’s basically
pivoting to an alternate strategy like REDIRECTION, AFFIRMATION, DENIAL, or some other DISTRACTION...
LYING, is the most difficult to tell without being in PERSON.

I’ll develop this idea more later on, but FALLACIES and FALSE ASSURANCES are EXTREMELY EASY to detect, 
if you listen for KEY WORDS or PHRASES.

People seem to think that you have to know THIS person, or THAT person in order to be CORRECT about something... 
but if you carry a god damn DICTIONARY around with you, everywhere ya go...? You can actually read the fuckin’
definition to a word that they thought you wouldn’t know... then like magic, instantly, you can see the
look on their face when they realize no other person is needed now. 

The fewest number of people needed to resolve something or find CORRECT ANSWERS, is actually pretty fucking
important. When you have a LABYRINTH of people that you have to slide your availability around to whip out a
grappling hook, collect a prize, earn a bunch of points until you acclimate enough to meet PERSON # 2, you’ll 
have wasted a lot of fuckin’ time.

Guy  : Oh, you don’t have a GRAPPLING HOOK...?
       Well, who the fuck are YOU, buddy...?
You  : Uh, pretty sure I just wanna talk to the main guy...
Guy  : *chuckles* LOL. 
       Yeah right, buddy.
       EVERYBODY wants to talk to the main guy...
       Can’t just talk to the main guy without a GRAPPLING HOOK.
You  : Well, why the fuck not...?
Guy  : *chuckles*

Somehow, what I mean specifically, is that people will use RED HERRINGS. CONSTANTLY. 
RED HERRINGS can really be ANY of those above strategies too, sometimes they are meant to PROTECT someone.

Whatever the hell they said about somebody they know or whoever, wherever...? That’s a REDIRECTION.
You can tell that person to FUCK OFF, cause the definition of a word says <definition>. 
Sometimes, they will make a stink because they are STALLING/DISTRACTING you. (^ That’s what that dialog is)

In other words, THEY KNOW THEY’RE CAUGHT. They won’t SAY that, typically... unless they’re using FAKE SARCASM.
Like “oOoOOhhHh, ya got me.” (← MAY SOUND LIKE SARCASM, sometimes it is a LITERAL ADMISSION)
The only way to tell the difference is to go with your gut instinct. 
Typically their body language will be their TELL. (← I’ll have to explain this term later)

I’ll give you a perfect example. DENNIS BRUCE from FAMILY COURT, seemed to think that the PUBLIC DEFENDERS 
are constantly fuckin’ busy. I’m sure that they are BUSY, but not TOO BUSY to call their client, nor email 
them back. That dude was talkin’ out of his ass. 

Not only did this man fuckin’ lie to me a FEW times, he also somehow had a way of knowing how many times I
called the PUBLIC DEFENDER. Seemed to have a pretty TELLING/OVERCONFIDENT attitude, sometimes a character 
has fooled a lot of OTHER people, and so they develop a CALLOUSED NATURE where they’re cold and heartless 
about doing this... 

Like SAUL GOODMAN from BREAKING BAD, managed to convince some woman that HE was KEVIN fuckin’ COSTNER, 
because he said it so PROFOUNDLY and STRONGLY...? Even HE believed it. (← CONVICTION) 

However, sometimes someone is literally telling the truth...
...which is why the two are fucking amazingly difficult to DISCERN.

These people, will operate on PERSONALITY before PRINCIPLE. (this will undermine ANYONE’S intelligence)
Basically if the public defenders are all outstanding citizens, then that means they’re fuckin’ awesome every 
day, always accurate, never make a single fuckin’ mistake... nah. 

When people say “everybody makes mistakes”, well... they don’t realize: 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
| HOW OFTEN EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES | EVERY CASE THEY HANDLE, there’s a lot of DIFFERENT MISTAKES being made |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
What makes somebody a CUT ABOVE THE REST, is if you’re EAGLE-EYED like I am...? 
YOU can VISUALLY SEE the MISTAKE RIGHT IN PLAIN SIGHT. 
So, if Judge Paul Pelagalli has (made a SERIES OF CRITICAL ERRORS in handling a case/some jizz on his chin...?)
It’s fair game to tell him in his OWN courtroom “Hey bub, you got a lil’ smidge of jizz on your chin there.”

There’s nothing particularly SPECIAL about ME, or anyone that’s wicked observant...? 
...other than the fact that I literally see things that OTHER PEOPLE don’t bother to QUESTION. 

When you ask questions, someone that rests on their laurels will not realize that you’re smarter than they are.
This “asking questions” makes them “more intelligent”, and so when this is combined with ‘RECORDING EVIDENCE’, 
THEN it stands to reason that the 20 days I did in the Saratoga County Jail, represents a CRIME that Judge 
Paul Pelagalli committed.

I was able to determine that the court actually had to abuse a SERIES of people, that OPENLY LIED and VIOLATED 
MY RIGHTS, in order to revoke custody of my children. (← FASCISM/COMMUNISM)

They, really hope that I go and attack somebody with a weapon because they pegged me for someone who would do 
that … decades ago. But, amazingly, HEATHER BRONDI was never correct about that. I really don’t know what her 
fuckin’ problem is, but, she has always been DECEPTIVE toward me. A lot of the kids I went to school were. 
Because a lot of them pity me.

They really shouldn’t. 

Some people make many assumptions in life, then they may ALSO make FALSE ASSURANCES, or they will use 
FALLACIOUS LOGIC in order to: 
                        _______________________________________________________________
                        | CLARIFY their JUSTIFICATION (and/or) ARRIVE at a CONCLUSION |
                        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
CLARIFICATION for a JUSTIFICATION → Typically PUBLIC DEFENDERS operate on the notion that someone filled out
the FORM correctly, then the FINANCIAL situation a given prospect/client is in, influences them to take a case. 

But, this can ALSO be applied in the REVERSE DIRECTION, to how RICH PEOPLE can sometimes ASSUME that they are 
A LOT MORE IMPORTANT than everyone else, so they can USE their CAPITAL to PURCHASE a LAWYER that can OVERRIDE 
the JUSTICE SYSTEMS sense of JUSTICE. (For instance, OJ SIMPSON + JOHNNY COCHRAN)

ARRIVAL at a CONCLUSION → Essentially, sometimes this occurs BEFORE people have their facts straight...
SOMETIMES they have their facts straight after all, but this is actually REALLY RARE.          (← EFFORT WAS APPLIED)

Most of the time, they don’t particularly (give a shit/care) if they have their facts straight.            (← INSULT)
They’re “experts”, they have been doing this for 30+ years.                                       (← FALSE ASSURANCE)
They obviously wouldn’t be in their current position if they made so many careless mistakes.              (← FALLACY)
UNLESS... the HIDDEN GOVERNMENT allowed that person to obtain that position.              (← ^ ALL of these COMBINED)

ASSUMPTIONS are like this: “SARATOGA COUNTY, PROBABLY has a bunch of GOOD PEOPLE who work there.”
HOWEVER, that is a SAFE ASSUMPTION to make, because not all people are inherently evil, besides there are 
NO HARD NUMBERS written in that statement, and the word PROBABLY indicates that it (would/could) FLUCTUATE.
People are not BORN EVIL, they are TAUGHT to be EVIL, as they may be:
                ________________________________________________________________________________
                | PERMANENTLY DAMAGED | EMOTIONALLY/PHYSICALLY SCARRED | VULNERABLE | CULPABLE | 
                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Though this is a very aggressive (GENERALIZATION/STEREOTYPE), HUMANITY WILL CAPITALIZE ON THE WEAK.
Most of them FAIL to know what FEIGNING WEAKNESS, is (PRETENDING to be WEAK, like a possum playing dead). 
When you prove that you were strong, they will fuckin’ pretend like they can’t see that.

Many people will say something like “Grow up”, or “You’ve never changed”... 
People remain the same person they were back in the distant past. 
Yeah, they may have distracted themselves and such... 
...but however things always FELT between YOU and SOME OTHER PERSON... 
...they apparently remain in gridlock. 

People ATTEMPT to convince themselves otherwise, but bring up something from the past. 
It’ll bring that person you remember, right back out.

These terms refer to using LOGIC LOOPHOLES to justify a sensibility or reasoning. 
(^ they UNDERMINE a person’s intelligence)

Which means that someone’s REPUTATION determines their ACCURACY or QUALITY in someone else’s’ eyes.
However, people have no fuckin’ idea how stupid they sound when they say 
“I’m sure there’s a big misunderstanding”...when I have evidence or pictures or whatever.        (← FALSE ASSURANCES)

The key word to look out for in a FALSE ASSURANCE, is literally the word “sure”.          (← SOMETIMES SLIGHTLY MORE)
Like this lady SARAH SCHELLING, she was supposed to be my lawyer, and she was playing fuckin’ games. 
She would be real snappy about getting in touch with me, give me a little hand off, and then after that,
reluctant to communicate with me. 

MICHAEL CAROTA was a way better lawyer than her. 
FREDERICK RENCH was ALSO a decent lawyer. But in EACH of these cases, crimes were in fact, committed TO me. 
Those crimes were both 1) committed AND 2) ignored by: the (SCSO/Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office). 

It SHOULD be ILLEGAL for SCSO James Leonard to ARREST me for something, when I have an ALIBI from ANOTHER 
officer from SCSO... right? WRONG. That’s how SCSO operates. 

I have done my own private investigation work with SCSO, they are straight up dirty as fuck... 
...and so is SARATOGA COUNTY.     (← Most people never make this determination since they’re not doing FOIL requests)

In either case, both RENCH and CAROTA got whatever I was looking at down to ACOD. The COOL thing is, the 
guys that tried to MURDER me, they never faced any trouble at all. They prevented my 911 calls from being 
answered, whereby indicating to me that <SCSO facilitated the murder attempt>, so I have to keep repeating 
myself... That’s why I keep insulting SCSO.

The guy who runs it, apparently doesn’t understand NOR care, that if he wants me to say positive things 
about him, OR, retract some of my opinions...? Well, he’s not doin’ a great job of holding:
                                 _______________________________________________

...accountable for OBVIOUS MISTAKES. Which tells ME that there is indeed... 
...an ugly fuckfaced demon...
...outlined with a SHARPIE marker...
...that indicates MALICIOUS/NEFARIOUS INTENT. (← MALICE)

I’m not indicating that the ORGANIZATION/AGENCY is full of MALICIOUS assholes who never uphold the law.
That is the IMPRESSION that SOME PEOPLE are attempting to CONVEY, however that IMPRESSION is HIGHLY INACCURATE.
Which is why it helps to generate an ASSOCIATION LIST, and then show those people who I think is doing a FINE
JOB, versus the people I know are CUTTING CORNERS and BREAKING THE RULES.

I used to work at a place called WENDY’S many years ago. This dude that I worked with, had this fuckin’ 
amazingly corny philosophy... that wasn’t really all that corny after looking back on it.

Barry : Nah, it’s literally why our burgers are fuckin’ square, dude.

Assurances, basically as soon as you hear the word “SURE” that’s probably an assurance. 
Make sure that you ask this person something to admit some level of CERTAINTY, because a false assurance is 
ALSO an assumption.

People try to play games like “there’s no way that you could possibly know that you’re correct.”    (← FALLACY ALERT)
Whether somebody KNOWS something, or they SUSPECT something, INTUITION is how law men operate.
That means, they bear quite an uncanny relevance to one another.

With a FALLACY, it’s typically a combination of the terms “(impossible/no possibility/no way)” or “by now” 
and even “(COULD/SHOULD/WOULD)’VE”. I provide more examples in this material. 
I have been littering the content this far with *(← INDICATORS)*

So like “Honey, if they wanted you dead, you’d be dead by now.”                                     (← FALLACY ALERT)

What this sentence basically says is, “You’re a fuckin’ moron, and they get everybody.” 
That’s what that person is sayin’ to ya.
Doesn’t really mean much else. 
Because, they’re operating on the ASSUMPTION that EVERYBODY gets killed by these people.

While the truth is, EVERYBODY DOES <EVENTUALLY> DIE...?
The assumption being made with THIS PARTICULAR FALLACIOUS STATEMENT is that you’re TOO PATHETIC, or not: 
                ________________________________________________________________________________
                | important | famous/cool | rich | rare/unique | smart/intelligent | observant |              
                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
That’s literally what that statement means. 
So if someone who ALLEGEDLY “loves you”, says THIS statement out loud...?
“If they were tryin to kill ya, they would’ve killed ya.”                                           (← FALLACY ALERT)
They’ve immediately deserved to be insulted in the worst way.
Because nobody who LOVES someone, should ever say something like that.
Especially if what they’re indicating, is “that’s what happened to my father.”

On the contrary, you can tell that person that there is the possibility [that they tried a few times], 
and the person, who might be your own mother, has to be told what an oblivious <unspecified> she is, to say that.

I wouldn’t recommend doing that outright. Looking back at this material in the future, I’ll regret how I’ll 
feel about PRINTING it, but it’s staying in there.

My father told my mother, “I think I’m being hunted” way back in 1995. 
My father knew someone was looking for him. He was killed by 3 black guys, ZONTELL GORDON, 
CLIFTON WILLIAMSON, and TYRELL CRAWFORD. I believe that ZONTELL GORDON was hired to “execute” my father, 
and that it was not a robbery at all. Why...? Well, none of these guys NAMED THE TRIGGER MAN. 
AND, the DISPATCHER was ALSO INVOLVED, in another cab drivers’ death (Sammy). Huh. 
And, FRANCINE VERO somehow made her way into the story back in 1999…

…AND, 2019… via [COMPUTER ANSWERS vs PRECISION PERIODONTICS*]. 
The reason why this [WEIRD COINCIDENCE*] somehow APPEARS to be coincidental, is mainly because… 
…it isn’t coincidental at all. Shucks.

The reason why it APPEARS to be COINCIDENTAL, is because there are a lot of moronic people involved who don’t 
know how to make CORRELATIONS. That would include POLICE OFFICERS, INVESTIGATORS, LAWYERS, DISTRICT ATTORNEYS,
JUDGES, FAMILY MEMBERS, FRIENDS, ET CETERA… 

Well whaddya know...? It’s almost like, clues were right there underneath the official police agencies nose
that whole entire time that they were parked at U-Turns, eating donuts, and issuing SPEEDING TICKETS… 
…instead of like, holding off on the fuckin’ donuts (*cough* TROOPER CARTER/BORDEN), and like… 
…INVESTIGATING THE MURDER ATTEMPT that occurred on… 05/26/20 right before [SCSO-2020-028501*]. Amazing.

Yeah, when I talk about shit like that, people in my family will get really pissed that I’m a lot more 
intelligent than they are. There’s no need to continue the statement, people in my family, get WICKED PISSED,
that I am MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THEY WILL EVER BE, to say these things. 
I also think my aunt TERRI COOK had something to do with that scenario as well.

MAYBE she’s bipolar. (← NOT a CRIME/TOTALLY LEGAL)

Maybe, the dude doesn’t even bother looking. Then, she’ll wipe it off. Damn. The evidence is gone now. She wins.

That didn’t ACTUALLY happen, but I am saying, a lot of girls will literally pull that off, just based on 
their APPEARANCE alone. Like, literally just cause they’re hot. Not cause she’s telling the truth... she 
probably will feel sorry at some point, but you can’t really expect that at all.

But, suppose… she started doing SOMETHING ELSE, and didn’t HEAR me say that. She may not NOTICE the SUPPOSED

I’m being honest right now, (^ this never happened in its EXACT context).
That girl never blew me. But, we did almost get down back in like 2003, or 2004.

I tried to say that, and everyone was like “FuCk YoU bRo~!! GeT oUtTa HeRe~!!”
Wasn’t like she wasn’t hot, she was. Deceitful, is the word.
Only good to fuck here and there, and then kick her the fuck out.
Many girls are like that.

The moral of the story is basically that people should trust APPEARANCES a lot LESS than they do.
Because APPEARANCES CAN BE DECEIVING. Doesn’t mean that everything people say should immediately be BELIEVED,
but if somebody is INSISTENT about a particular STATEMENT or STORY...? It’s probably worth investing some 
ATTENTION/EFFORT, after all.

AMBER BURDO is my ex-girlfriend, she was not QUITE* as hot as Meghan,                        (← Pretty fuckin’ close)  
However, she seemed to be a LOT more intelligent, which made her more hot in my book.

Meghan a bartender, being a (9-10 outta 10), not exactly the brightest girl in the world, but, still... 
...loses a 1-2 point(s) for honesty issues...
...AND for throwing me out of the bar one night when AMBER was in the hospital because of ME.       (← Covered later)

Amber had plans to be a nurse someday, (is/was) ALSO a bartender and server (8-9 outta 10), and she was 
actually smart to the point where she had to ACT like she wasn’t around other people. 
She played it down all the time, I never understood it.

I’m likely to say better things about her, because of that, however- she TOO had honesty issues.
ALL females have this issue.

Therefore, I can’t really put a number on either one. 
Amber, was actually annoying sometimes. 

She would be SO unpredictable, that she would just show up out of nowhere...
...and guerrilla warfare surprise me...
...and say “SUP FUCKFACE...?”

Never knew what the hell she was thinking when she wasn’t around.
That’s the key take away. They cannot be depended on with any degree of certainty at all, ever.

The explanation being, that some dude was peeing standing up in that dude’s bathroom, and they may have been
CERTAIN to do EVERYTHING ELSE PICTURE PERFECT TO AVOID BEING DETECTED...? But a couple of lil’ pee droplets in
the most impossible place of all, gave it ALL away.

On one hand, the FIRST dialog shows a sense of being a CONTROL FREAK. (← Don’t be THAT)
Whereas the second dialog shows a sense of being TOTALLY OBLIVIOUS.   (← Don’t be THAT)

You have to expect that there’s a RANGE of responses and scenarios where you can trust a female with questions
that actually matter and can be CORROBORATED.

Even if you’re a REAL RICH BASTARD like ELON MUSK, or WILLIAM GATES, or JEFF BEZOS...

...doesn’t matter, females will also lie to them as well. Doesn’t mean they’ll CONSTANTLY LIE, but it DOES
mean that you cannot afford NOR allow to be either a CONTROL FREAK, or OBLIVIOUS.

That’s just how females are. That’s why I NEVER got married, and I NEVER fuckin’ will.
Guess I can’t say NEVER*, but ya know, I see how many other people go right ahead and do that...
...only to come to the realization at some later point in time...
...MAYBE, KURT RUSSELL and GOLDIE HAWN...
...had a way better game plan, by NOT getting married at all.

Still acting quite a lot LIKE a married couple...?
But- never married each other. Gee. I wonder why that plan works so well...

Look, society causes people to make a lot of erroneous assumptions.
The truth is, people play on each other’s EMOTIONS, and ASSURANCES are part of feeling CONFIDENT.

Then there are the logical constructs such as FALLACIES where the logic makes the same amount of sense as a 
screen door on a submarine. Basically, if a submarine has a fuckin’ screen door on it, and it goes underwater, 
then the thing will take on water. Eventually, everything in it is gone. 

That’s EXACTLY how FALLACIES work. They’re like a black hole, but with SENSE.
They’re like having a LEAK in a MAP in like, GTKRadiant, the game-space is supposed to be SEPARATE from the
VOID, but if there’s a LEAK...? Then, the COMPILER cannot FULLY RENDER the game map. Same exact concept.

So when POLICE ORGANIZATIONS, or the GOVERNMENT, or JUSTICE SYSTEM have a leak in THEIR LOGIC...?
It will eventually CAUSE THE ENTIRE CONSTRUCT TO FAIL.

Suffice to say, PRINCIPLE OVER PERSONALITY allows people to EXPECT that people WILL DEFINITELY attempt to 
ride on their APPEARANCE, PERSONALITY, or REPUTATION, rather than by sheer PRINCIPLE. That’s why it’s a more
effective tool than anything else in the PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION tool-belt.

Both of these strategies work [WAY TOO WELL*], actually.
Which is why the exact OPPOSITE tool, ALSO works WAY TOO WELL.
Except, #2 is ALWAYS VICTORIOUS with SUPPORTING EVIDENCE… that’s why society has been programmed to IGNORE IT.

At the root of both of these strategies, the truth is out there, somewhere.
When relying on root principles, ACCURACY DOES NOT SLIDE AROUND AIMLESSLY.

Most people in society live in between one end of the spectrum, and the other.
Very few are on either EXTREME end of the spectrum, to where they know damn well what their opponent is doing.

Because they’re both EXTREMELY MANIPULATIVE STRATEGIES, and you have to be PRETTY FUCKING INTELLIGENT to use
these effectively. Even if someone IS NOT that intelligent, these SOUND REASONINGS will STILL allow them to 
know when someone who is a lot more intelligent, is attempting to pull: A FAST ONE.

If some hot bitch like Meghan says a blatant fuckin’ lie to people, they will operate on the assumption 
that “there’s no way she would ever lie, because of how HOT she is...”                            (← ASSUMED FALLACY)

There is a way she would lie. Some people assumed that the hot bitch told the truth, but … 
they all fuckin’ lie. Every single one of em. There’s a good explanation for this, actually.

Not saying that they can’t be, but, the best thing you can really do is to just push people away.
Because they’ll hurt ya – cause <if they wanna stick around> → [they’re gonna fight back]
They may be interested in someones (MONEY/FAME/LOOKS/DICK SIZE), doesn’t really matter WHAT it is...
[SOMETHING will INEVITABLY CHANGE the dynamic of that relationship], and once that happens...? 
It becomes a [different entity] that has become → [STALE]. 

It is possible to build a solid relationship, but it needs to have a GAME like feel to it, and remain that way.
Which is EXACTLY why KURT RUSSELL and GOLDIE HAWN are a (prime candidate pair), to examine.

Anyway, until you have this CERTAINTY conditioning down... 
...you might actually believe when some hot bitch lies to YOU, even if you know damn well she just lied. 

It’s cause SOMEONE is allowing their EMOTIONS to INFLUENCE their DECISIONS, rather than PRINCIPLE. 
When they’re interested in YOU...? They’ll make themselves available, OR, they’ll even chase your ass down.

      I wanna fuck you, like… right now.
You : *fake yawn* Eh... it’s getting mad late. 
      I’m already asleep.
      I got work in the morning...
      *checks watch* Gotta fuckin’ get my rest, I got a LOOOONG day ahead of me.

Could even be some girl as hot as Savannah Sellars, that’s gonna piss her off, dude...
But- they do this stuff to guys CONSTANTLY.
NOW, she’s gonna think about it AFTERWARD...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

So, UNLESS you adopt the mentality to just keep doing that...?
She’s just gonna keep gettin’ upset. However- THIS ENTIRE CONCEPT IS “GAME”
Chances are, if she really likes somebody that does this...? She’s just gonna go home and go to bed...
Cause you just caused her to be really fuckin’ confused. Dudes hit on her ALL THE TIME, but YOU...?  
Well, now you’re stuck in her mind for some reason, so then when you aren’t available...? 
It reinforces the idea of SCARCITY.

Basically the same thing, you want the game of Monopoly to continue going on and on...
...so you have to allow yourself to LOSE sometimes, and your PARTNER or PROSPECT has to ALSO do this.
That keeps the GAME (alive/going).
So, you really can’t be 100% HONEST all the time, but that doesn’t mean that people should be IMMORAL.

If some of these concepts sound like “Oh man”...?
Then, you need to wake the fuck up.
Cause, until you can tell yourself that you know at all times, that it doesn’t matter how hot some girl is, 
you are going to expect them to be deceptive because that’s how it is... 
...then you won’t have any BASE REALITY CERTAINTY.
That’s important to be able to determine when someone is LYING. 

Because, people lie. Expect it. But- determine what TYPE of LYING you’re dealing with, is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.
The reason why it is DANGEROUS to ASSUME that EVERYONE LIES ALL THE TIME, is because in many cases, people will
be telling the truth, and THAT truth will be considered a LIE that doesn’t fit into the LESSON PLAN AT ALL.

Wanna know why…? Because the TRUTH sometimes sounds like a LIE, ESPECIALLY when someone has RELIED on a FOUNDATION 
OF LIES for a very long time, for instance, the NIST 9/11 report. That is a perfect example of a foundation of lies.
As for the type of LYING you’re likely to deal with…?

Is it more of a [HA HA, JUST KIDDING AROUND] type...? Or, a [FUCK OFF, and BURN IN HELL FOR ETERNITY] type...?
Cause I’ll tell ya, JAMES BOND had to determine this shit every time he met some broad...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Bond : Ya know, this bitch right here looks like she could kill me in my sleep...
       But- I really wanna bang the snot out of her, too.
       Decisions, decisions...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Obviously, humans have evolved over hundreds of thousands/millions of years, so, try to think about things like:
___________________________________________________________
| What would a cave man do...? (← BEST WAY TO LOOK AT IT) | 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
If you allow those emotions to control your decisions, then you might FEEL like you want to believe her because 
she’s fuckin’ hot man... cause everyone wants to have some PEACE in their life and not constantly WORRY.

So, they will actually lie to themselves and remain in denial, rather than to (accept/admit)... 

...that someone ELSE is probably banging the snot outta that hot girl, like, right now. Cause YOU would.
Operating on your assumptions. Dumbest fuckin’ way to live, actually.

Doctors, Lawyers, Police officers, Judges, Teachers, basically, a lot of people do this. Even investigators.
They’re not SUPPOSED to do that. They are SUPPOSED to determine with SHEER CERTAINTY, and yet they will fuckin’
lazily drag their dick around sometimes, appearing like they give a shit.    (← Don’t even try to tell me they don’t)

Anyway, until you accumulate enough [BASE REALITY CERTAINTY] at all times...?  
Then, a hot girl could say something FALSE to you, and EVEN if you [KNOW] it’s false...? 
You’ll believe her, because your EMOTIONS are in control of your DECISIONS.
UNTIL you put PRINCIPLE BEFORE PERSONALITY... you will NOT have a constant state of [BASE REALITY CERTAINTY]

ONCE YOU DO however, you can literally say stuff like:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

You  : Yeah, well...
       How would you like it, if I just...
       ...whipped my dick out...
       ...and smacked you across the face with it...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Because if you don’t say it like Bill O’Reilly...?
If you SAY something like that, they’ll SWITCH to being SUBMISSIVE. 
...cause that’s hot to them. 

Yeah, if a guy says that to another guy (obviously not gay), they’ll get pretty pissed:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Guy  : I wouldn’t.
       *assaults that dude*
       How’d you fuckin’ like that...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

But, girls will suddenly be like: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Girl : Whoa. 
       Yeah. 
       I kinda WOULD like that a LOT, actually.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Obviously, don’t go around saying shit like this unless a girl is throwing non-verbals that she’s interested.
Regardless, they will actually exhibit SOME of these non-verbal cues, without even realizing it. Such as:
  ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
  | Smiling | Laughing at your jokes | twirling their finger in hair | moving their feet | facing you directly |
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
That is why you have to expect that they will do this, and take command.

But, the philosophy behind ALL of it is, everybody has PREDICTABLE BEHAVIORS.

So, until you put PRINCIPLE before PERSONALITY...?
                  ----------------------------       
...then PERSONALITY, REPUTATION, or APPEARANCE will override every single interaction you have with people.
        --------------------------------------      ------------------------------------------------------
Therefore, you’ll have no certainty about anything. Because, your principles will slide around aimlessly. 
           ---------------------------------------                ---------------------------------------

$Book.AddSection(3,"Principle vs Emotion",@"
PRINCIPLES are not supposed to SLIDE AROUND AIMLESSLY, because those aren’t PRINCIPLES. 
Those are EMOTIONS, totally different fuckin’ thing. 

PRINCIPLES mean that no amount of time can change the way you feel about something. 
                    ________________________________________________________________________
                    | When you go to sleep   → you will       feel one way about something | 
                    | Then, the next morning → you will STILL feel the same way            | 
                    | Then, a year goes by   → you will STILL feel the same way            | 
                    | Decades go by          → you will STILL feel the same way            | 
                    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
EMOTIONS change from moment to moment. This ALSO considers “STATE OF MIND”.
You go to bed feeling one way...? You’ll wake up the next morning feeling VERY DIFFERENT. 
That’s why you shouldn’t base JUDGMENT or EXPECTATIONS, on EMOTIONS, because of how WILDLY they FLUCTUATE.

Most people in society have: PRINCIPLES that slide around aimlessly (They’re not principles, they’re emotions)

Just like how SO MANY doctors, lawyers, police officers, judges, teachers... they all think that they’re 
fuckin’ smart (they probably ARE, no doubt about it). BUT- IF they talk to each other, and grade OTHERS 
based on how they APPEAR... that literally cancels out how “SMART” they are. That means → No integrity.

I may be generalizing that statement to a large degree, HOWEVER, I have OBSERVED this PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR.

It’s why UNDERSTANDING LOGIC and how ALL of this works toward PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION will NEED to be

Gonna say it again. 
This is SUPER CRITICAL, if you’re going to [read this entire document] and [take it seriously].

The objective isn’t to fuckin’ tell Ted Cruz that he likes gettin’ drilled between the ass cheeks for a 
cool `$500M. Nah, dude probably doesn’t realize that he’s committing a serious crime because he’s that 
stupid. So, you gotta CONSIDER THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT ACTUALLY KNOW THAT THEY’RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG.             

However, don’t ASSUME that. PROVE it.

If that MAY BE the case...? Then, you really wanna catch him in the act.
What helps, is having a SERIES of <PSYCHOLOGICAL STRATEGIES>

With some degree of certainty at all, we can prevent additional mass shootings from happening, and additional 
victims popping up, because, the people that should be taking accountability for shit like that are guys like 
Ted Cruz. 

Doesn’t make any fuckin’ sense to me, at all, that the dude in Uvalde, TX on the press conference had to make 
excuses for Ted Cruz not being more proactive. That’s the beginning and end of the fuckin’ conversation. 
            ---------------------------------

Are there OTHER people to blame...? Yes. 
However, leaving it at JUST that, is foolhardy, as there is PLENTY of blame to go around. 
Ted is the MOST critical one TO blame, besides Abbott. Why...? I’ll explain.

Part of the strategy involved in KNOWING WHO TO BLAME, is going straight to the top.
So if I think that JAMES LEONARD at SCSO is basically a lazy cocksucker...? Go above him → MICHAEL ZURLO.
If MICHAEL ZURLO doesn’t respond to me, but CAPTAIN JEFF BROWN DOES...? Record that conversation.

| Already planned on talking about Ted god damn Cruz, cause he’s been getting fat stacks from Exxon Mobil for a |

| and since he invested a lot of his Exxon Mobil earnings into a particular company in Sierra Nevada...? Well,  |
| he’s gotta determine for himself whether he’s wasting his money... or not. He did take a page from Benjamin   |
| Franklin, and he wants to give HIS stamp of approval. Probably just had his bathroom floor remodeled, brand   | 
| new floor tiles that heat themselves up so the floor is never cold in the winter, even though he lives in     |

|===============================================================================================================| 
| Here’s the bottom line. The strategy here, is that, Ted, is going to distance himself from the problem that   | 
| just occurred. If I directly compare Chuck Schumer/Kirsten Gillibrand to Ted Cruz/John Cornyn. Yeah, I might  | 
| be able to get blame shifted over to them too, considering the incident at Tops. It wouldn’t REALLY be that   | 
| fair for Ted, to single HIM out, but he’s been accepting bribery from Exxon Mobil for years. He’s gotten like |

| Psychological Strategy # 4 | “Goodie Two-Shoes” → Well, let’s just see how good those two shoes really ARE... |
|===============================================================================================================| 
| Chuck Schumer doesn’t seem like he’s the type of dude that’s accepting bribery, but I would surely change my  |
| opinion if I knew that’s what was going on. The best way to know for sure if Chuck Schumer was doin’ that, is | 
| to watch and listen to the news. But also, scavenge C-SPAN type stuff every once in a while or read the Times |
| Union. Rex Smith, editor in chief. Telling falsehoods to fuck off... That’s the Times Union for ya. Even then |
| you won’t get a real, up close view, like the documentary I just listed. Not gonna talk about Gillibrand or   |
| Cornyn for long, Kirsten Gillibrand has always been like a younger version of Hillary Clinton, but one with a | 
| conscious. So, not in a bad way at all. I remember back in 2008 or 2012 she first ran when Hillary ran for    | 
| president, I voted for Kirsten Gillibrand, and still do.                                                      |
|                                                                                                               |
| It’s been awhile, Gillibrand stays relatively low key. Not showing up as often as Ted god damn Cruz does.     |
| Chuck Schumer shows up quite a lot and recalling specific examples of stuff that he has worked on, I can      |
| really only recall the infrastructure bill with Biden and Pelosi. Chuck did a lot of that with Pelosi when    |
| Trump was in office (still does). If Chuck hadn’t been there at all? The Earth would have already experienced | 
| a cataclysmic, nuclear event that wiped out all of mankind. Practically certain of it. Idk man. Trump was a   |

| I’m not gonna blame that dude from that Sheriff department from the Uvalde incident.                          |

| Maybe I’m just adding insult to injury on Ted, but considering that I’ve been writing this document since     |

I could really go on with an entire book laying out strategy after strategy, however it all breaks down to 
philosophy, morals, and their ethical implications, which I’ll discuss more about in:
[Chapter – See no evil, Speak no evil, Hear no evil (Malice)]

That dude, from the Sheriffs in Uvalde, will probably not understand why I’m sticking up for him, and a lot 
of people are gonna be fuckin’ confused.

Suppose, if you would... that Michael Zurlo EVER showed up on TV. At least Craig Apple, I’ve seen him on TV a 
couple times. Never once seen Mike Zurlo one time. Pretty difficult to have empathy for somebody that’s been
constantly ignoring me, for *checks watch* about 2 years now. But then again, it’s also difficult to know for 
certain that the dude isn’t just busy as hell. (← BULLSHIT)

Regardless, I have issues with SCSO. Craig Apple, at least I don’t have outstanding issues with Albany County, 
but- that is where Cuomo spent most of his time. Just, invitin’ girls over that didn’t wanna fuck at all... 
and then Hochul APPEARS to be doing rather well. In comparison...? Cuomo would show up and fuckin’ rip a chain 
of nasty farts and have the sign language dude convey THAT somehow... I’m exaggerating.

Imagine the sign language (dude/lady) made all that commotion:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Sign Language : So, Governor Cuomo JUST ripped another nasty ass fart...
                Now, it smells like...
                ...burnt tuna fish...? 
                ...now Fabreeze.
                He just sprayed some Fabreeze when nobody was looking...
                Or wait, the person sitting next to him is the one spraying the Fabreeze, my bad.
                He’s going on and on about some bullshit about COVID...?
                It’s really, not worth translating any of this shit, to be perfectly honest...
                This fuckin’ dude JUST FARTED again, holy shit...
                Now, it smells like Dr. Scholls anti-fungal spray...
                ...or, tough actin’ Tinactin...
                or, somethin’ like that...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Point being, I really don’t blame Abbott in Texas, nor do I blame Hochul or Cuomo...
...as much as I do Ted god damn Cruz, for a really fuckin’ sinister incident after all. 

Now, TEXAS is FUCKIN HUGE. NEW YORK is also rather LARGE, but comparing the stories here, Tops considers a 
kid driving 2 hours away to scout out the location... (just like the 2 dudes I recorded in IMG_0647.mov 
on my Apple iPhone 8+ [05/25/20 2343 → 05/26/20 0004]) Whereas Uvalde, TX was some kid basically having a
fuckin’ meltdown. Wasn’t even really that old, either. Sounds slightly like Adam Lanza in Newtown CT.

It’s really difficult to make direct comparisons here, because a lot of people keep dying, and it does nobody 
justice to exclude the ACTUAL MANIAC that caused the event... However- I think that’s ALL people keep doing.
The solution isn’t passing additional laws or restrictions, it’s not reducing the 2nd amendment, 
it’s not JUST mental health, but also, the WAY in which PEOPLE are SCREENED and then PROVIDED the SERVICES
that they fuckin’ need.

Yeah, so like, RICHARD TODD LOEBER, SUSAN MCDERMOTT, and MICHAEL ZURLO, should stop working together to label
NON-INSANE people, as insane or delusional. There is an actual, legitimate link between these fuckin’ people.
They’re criminals. Point blank, they may not be CRIMINALS in the sense that they’ve GOTTEN CAUGHT, but they
are performing ILLEGAL, CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES in tandem. (← WHY THE PROBLEMS ARE AS BAD AS THEY ARE)

Do I think for one fuckin’ second that this is a SARATOGA COUNTY ONLY ISSUE? Uh, no I fuckin’ definitely don’t.
However, suppose that MICHAEL ZURLO already MADE THE EFFORT, to DRIVE TO MY FUCKIN HOUSE, and APOLOGIZE for
the NUMBER OF INCIDENTS already...? WELL, that would have resolved a lot of issues by now. There’s a reason why
he hasn’t thought to do that quite yet. Also, RICHARD TODD LOEBER and SUSAN MCDERMOTT, are committing MEDICAL
FRAUD... rather than to EFFECTIVELY SCREEN PEOPLE. What happens is that many of the people that wind up at the 
SARATOGA HOSPITAL MENTAL HEALTH UNIT... have been put there because SOMEONE IMPORTANT was CAUGHT by THEM.

That’s right. It’s basically a “POLITICAL OPPONENT JAILHOUSE.” (← MEDICAL FRAUD)

$Book.AddSection(3,"Solution",@"
There’s a SOLUTION for all of these massacres, I believe that the problem MAY BE BEST RESOLVED, by people 
making a better COLLABORATIVE EFFORT, to talk about how they feel – ESPECIALLY as it concerns (PEOPLE/THINGS) 
they DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT (STIGMA). 
Society has a serious issue where I really doubt 90% of people will openly express how they actually feel to 
another person. I’ll go with Noam Chomski’s percentages here, 80% of people probably tell OTHERS about 20% of 
the things THEY think about. Whereas the 20% that I probably fit into, will express about 80% of the things  
THEY think about. The problem isn’t the 80/20 or vice versa, but stigma, OR, reluctance to talk about these 
things I’ve discussed here in this document.
To be fair, a lot of the stuff I’d typically write on my FACEBOOK profile...? They are typically one-off skits
or stories. This piece involves really everything. Because, what the fuck... People keep dying, and these guys 
at Fox News have the best ratings in the industry (supposedly), and they’re gonna keep saying that climate 
change isn’t real, and not talk about the very real dick-in-the-mouth situation Hannity is in, every day. Why?

Well, it’s because this HIDDEN GOVERNMENT that puts tape over people’s mouths, is definitely an issue. 

That does not mean that Kirsten Gillibrand is fuckin’ bouncin outta state every day, trying to hang out with 
some shadow warriors and scheme a new way to fuck people over... not at all. I’m not gonna make assumptions 
based on her appearance, I’m also not going to make assumptions about Chuck Schumer... BUT A LOT OF OTHER 
PEOPLE WILL DO THAT.

They’ll be like “Ah. There’s Hillary Rodham ‘Who gives a shit...?’ Clinton, at Madelline Albright’s funeral 
service. She is fucking amazing, isn’t she...? Look... at... her. Fuckin’ absolutely stellar and perfect.”
Yeah, I realize people aren’t using those EXACT words, but the context is quite accurate.

Meanwhile, Julien Assange, is in prison. MAYBE, he had some nice things to say about Madelline Albright too.
Nobody was like: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

People  : HEY JULIEN... 
          COME TO THIS FUNERAL SERVICE AND GIVE A SPEECH.
Assange : I fuckin’ cannot actually do that.
          I’m in a literal (concrete+steel) contraption, designed for CRIMINALS that have BROKEN the LAW.
          I don’t fuckin quite understand why I’m here...
People  : Aw, alright dude...
          Guess we’ll just have the procession without ya...
          Toodaloo.
Assange : Who is the service for, may I ask...?
People  : Oh, well it’s for Madelline Albright.
Assange : *sighs* Really...?
          She was basically my best friend, in the whole world...
People  : Oh yeah...?
Assange : Yeh...
          *sighs* She and I...?
          *dramatic pause* We went to kindergarten together.
          Had to put our thumb on the top of the straws...
          ...poking them into the little milk bags.
          Then, we’d play hide and seek...? 
          Red-light, green-light...? 
          Cops and robbers...? 
          We’d actually hold hands and giggle... 
          And even swing on the swing set...
          Ride the see-saw on the playground.
          Eventually, we made it to our senior year together, and we just...
          ...grew apart.
          You have no idea how DEVASTATED I am...
          ...that she’s just... gone.
People  : Alright, you don’t mind if we like, ghost write that into Hillary Clinton’s speech, do you...?
Assange : Yeah, I do.
People  : Yeah, you’re ok if we do that...? 
          Or, yeah you mind if we do that...?
Assange : Dude, are you being for real right now...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Pretty sure that Assange would NOT be okay with someone ghost writing things into their speech...
...but the HIDDEN GOVERNMENT would sure as hell be perfectly content with that idea, I would imagine.

Pretty sure even Ted Cruz has nothing to do with the decisions that they make within the HIDDEN GOVERNMENT, 
I’m not talking about DEEP STATE either. I know that shit exists. Something FAR WORSE than that, is happening.

This process is going to take a long time, but logically speaking, teaching people about what the 
Constitution is really all about, is gonna help.

Because really, if some of these people wanted my respect, one of the best ways they could do that, 
is [SURVEYS]. Just a lot more surveys, really. Can’t be something that’s forced down people’s throats, 
but I doubt that Facebook or even Google has even considered increasing their survey counts.

Back in the day, I would occasionally get these calls form a place called Market Insights, but that was 
typically for business related stuff. Or products/services, or purchasing habits. They could really apply 
that mentality to these surveys, so instead of there being like a single election day or something, have a 
community convention plan. Because I think that the idea of having a public square is a pretty good idea and 
it’s worth capitalizing on, because people will see the red flags a lot more often.

Surveyor : Wow.
           That’s... 16 people right there.

Person   : Heh.
           Thanks.
Surveyor : So, what types of stuff do they say about this kid...?
Person   : Oh, well they say some of the worst shit people could say about somebody...
           Satanic rituals...
           Circles with an upside down star shaped thing...
Surveyor : You mean, like PENTAGRAMS...?
Person   : *snaps fingers* YEAH.
           That’s the word I was lookin’ for.
Surveyor : Oh, wow.
           Sounds like quite a demonic fuck-face to me, alright...
Person   : Yeah, some people think he’s like a serial killer or something.

           This is fuckin’ intense, kid.
           Not gonna lie.

Now, could it be expected to have a conversation like that in the wild...?
Nah. However, FACEBOOK COULD LITERALLY BE DOING THAT... and they don’t.
Ya know...? They have a whole ARRAY of people’s information, and they could very easily say: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Facebook : HEY, FUCKFACE.
Person   : …? Me?
Facebook : Yeah, YOU.
Person   : Jesus. 
           You’re bein’ real rude...
Facebook : LOOK PAL, we see the way you talk to all your friends...
           We’re just trying to be informal.
Person   : Oh, alright.
           I guess that’s better than the formal “What products have you heard of recently...? A/B/C/D”
Facebook : Nah, you’re right, gettin’ right in your fuckin’ face to ask you some shit...
Person   : This is a little too difficult to believe...
Facebook : Look, who among your friends...
           ...strikes YOU as a really psychotic individual who might lash out and fuckin’ kill people...?
           Be honest ya fuckin’ clown boy...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Of course, Facebook doesn’t need to be that aggressive about it, but- the point is to INSULT somebody so 
they’re a little more comfortable to be INFORMAL, and then they’ll be [MORE honest], as it is no longer FORMAL.
Another way of doing that, is to just spam the shit out of people with fake person friend requests, and then,
capitalize on the opportunity after they’ve started a dialog. (← Somebody does this shit already)

Another thing is basic general psychology and teaching regular everyday kids as well as the adults, things like
Jordan Petersen does, his stuff is pretty useful and good. However, just listening to people isn’t gonna work 
because they will probably hit the snooze button on it a lot or outright pass it up to begin with. 
I have no doubt that Ted is not gonna be real appreciative if he reads this document cause... 
I put quite a bit of effort describing what Exxon Mobil’s doin’ to em in a myriad of ways, but- 
if guys like him were like:

Cruz : Man, dude... you’re right. 
       *hands up, wiggling fingers* OoOoHhh I’m a fuckin’ clown...
Me   : Hey, acceptance is the FIRST step.
Cruz : I was being facetious.
Me   : No way bro, that was totally legit.
       You just admitted it...
Cruz : Alright, so, surveys and just having like a community ice cream party or some shit...?
Me   : Well, no, it’d be more involved than that.
       You get like motivational speakers to come along, and just have a more tightly knit community.
Cruz : That’s impossible though, not everybody will come.
Me   : Aha. There ya go, what a useful way to figure out who’s NOT being checked on or being involved...
       Almost like you could like, print out a list of names...
       Have them all check themselves in...
       Make sure you teach all of THOSE people some shit they could consider as helpful...
       Then whatever names weren’t checked in, then you have a list to follow up on.
       Then you could like, fuckin, go door to door and just annoy them to make sure they’re ok.
       That way, people will give somebody some type of indication about things like the RED FLAGS...
Cruz : That’s... actually not a bad idea... 
Me   : Right.

The best case I can make about this hidden government shit, is to compare and contrast laws that don’t make 
any fuckin’ sense. Because, how do they get passed...? 

I can’t find the specific document but Paul Pelagalli and (Neil Weiner/Chowder Lips) apparently hopped on an
opportunity to get me in trouble for recording a virtual appearance, that shit should NOT be illegal at all, 
but since it is... 

I’m tempted to go to this place with some hot bitch, and just rail the snot out of her right outside 
Judge Pelagalli’s office. See if he’ll fuckin’ do anything about that. “OoOOoOOhhH that’s illegal...” 

Probably not that funny that I might have to do that at some point. Maybe I’ll just have to figure out where 
HE lives, and then, bring that girl there, and then, just fuckin’ bang the snot out of her in his own fuckin’ 
bed, see how he fuckin’ likes that. 

I’m probably not gonna do that, but if I write about it, maybe he’ll think that shit is both intriguing AND 
alarming, but... he will probably watch, especially if she’s hot enough. Dude’s gonna take my fuckin’ kids 
away... Gotta make some new ones, ya know...

       Like I was caught off guard when a couple of fuckin’ cocksuckers tried to murder me on May 26th 2020.
       Almost like if I wanted to, I could’ve done something totally different, couldn’t I have...?
       Like, did the same to you.
       Now I’m bangin’ some girl in YOUR bed, dude.
       You’re a fuckin’ judge.
       How am I doin, is this a good pounding I’m givin’ this bitch...?

$Book.AddSection(3,"Multi-Pronged Approach (2)",@"
Cause let’s face it... 
Pelagalli is probably gonna think to himself that he definitely misjudged me for fuckin’ sure. 
It’d been a while since HIS bed had seen any action, so, had to fuckin’ go in there and get a job done...
But, this is gonna come off as real chauvinistic, and, probably degrading in some way... Erotic...? Most likely.
Insulting...? Maybe...

I have determined that if something has both an INSULTING aspect to it, but a HOT BITCH is involved...
Doesn’t feel so insulting cause it has another criteria called EROTIC.
Everyone can imagine some super-hot smokin’ female, they’re gonna enjoy hearin’ about it cause that’s how 
INTEREST works. Whether it’s how Fox News turns news → propaganda, or its financial or social interest...
Interest is important.

But, it is probably difficult to FEEL insulted if a judge committed some crimes, so did his court, 
and then so did the public defender’s office, and so did Dennis Bruce, and then somehow I had to do something 
that ignored all that shit, cause, now Paul Pelagalli’s watching me, destroy this bitches rear end and he’d 
rather watch than to call anybody or whatever. 

He knows I’m not tryin’ to hurt the guy at all... I’m havin’ sex with a real hot bitch in HIS bed. 
Maybe I could bring her to Andy Cuomo’s house too.  

That’s the FIRST part of a multi-pronged approach... it’s not the whole plan though.
Now, what I could’ve done in the story so far, was reach my hand around her body, and start fiddling with 
her clit. Then I’m introducing a multi-pronged approach within a story that just so happens to be the FIRST 
part of a multi-pronged approach story.

Multi-pronged approaches are like loading up a dropship with marines, and droppin’ em on somebody’s 
mineral/worker line in Starcraft, and then sendin’ some siege tanks to the front gate. Either way, it’s an 
effective fuckin’ strategy.

I mean, realistically, has anyone ever thought to write up a story to “get back at” a judge like him, 
with a story like this...? Probably not. I would imagine, people will read this, and some girls will probably 
get pretty wet in the pants. Well, fuckin’ good. They’d better... Especially if I keep describing it too...

Yeah, I’m gonna say that’s bound to probably HUMILIATE him while also INTRIGUE the hell out of him, cause,

fucks the snot outta some hot bitch in my bed, cause he figured out where I live and got in somehow... 
He’s … got some fuckin’ nerve I’ll tell ya... but then he was cool enough to ask her to cob on my knob...
at least THAT part’s not too bad...” 

That’s right. Cause I’m thinkin’ the same thing about YOU (havin’ a lot of nerve) and YOUR GOD DAMN COURT, 
and LAURA HUGHES and CPS, and a slew of names and places realistically, that I know LIED TO MY FUCKING FACE, 
and then TOOK MY FUCKING KIDS AWAY, all cause apparently some moron at SCSO tried to get me killed and failed. 
Cool. Fuck you bro. 

Your court is literally trash. The petitioner wrote NUMEROUS FALSE STATEMENTS on her petition, and the COURT
APPOINTED LAWYER AVOIDED MY FUCKING PHONE CALLS AND EMAILS, and even GAVE ME THE WRONG FUCKING TRIAL DATE. So...

I’m gonna write a fuckin’ story where I talk about how I just find a way to outsmart a bunch of people. 
What the hell.

If Andrew Cuomo can harass 11 women, and gets away with that, then I should be able to bang the snot out of 
this hot bitch in a FICTIONAL STORY. In this dudes bed though, in that fictional story. And in the story, 
you’re like “Damn, that girl just sprayed all over my fuckin’ bed... and I actually like the smell of that... 
then she just sucked me off. I don’t even really know what to say cause you’re confusing the hell out of me...”

That’s probably a detail that pushed it over the top, huh? Sentence me to 20 days in the county jail and then 
don’t mail me the fuckin’ order. Don’t worry dude, I made sure she’ll give you the best head you’ve probably 
gotten in years. You’re welcome. Even Andrew Cuomo didn’t get that lucky. Not even gonna call Judge Paul 
Pelagalli a sausage wrecker cause he doesn’t seem to be one at least from my observations.

^ That’s another part of the multi-pronged approach. Cause if I just tell people like a fuckin’ crybaby, 
‘OooOohH fuckin’ Pelagalli fuckin’ did some real shady shit to me~!’ People will say “Fuck you bro.”
So, I expect that people are gonna do that, I know most people WON’T say that at all, but if I make this about 
CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTIES AND RIGHTS, and how some fuckin’ more-than-just-a-touch-of-gray douchebag that calls 
himself a fuckin’ judge... acts a lot like Andrew Cuomo... Well, if Theodore Roosevelt (the former President) 
were alive today, would probably waltz in there, and knock this guy out, cold. “Million dollar fine, fuckface.” 

He’s written about later in this story, because HE HAD INTEGRITY and HE KNOCKED MOTHERFUCKERS OUT. If the 
president punches somebody in the face, that’s a million-dollar fine right there, now he’s gotta ice his hands 
down. Theodore Roosevelt doesn’t pull any punches, if he’s gonna hit someone, it’s gonna fuckin’ hurt. He can 
only do that in limited quantities, but he’ll do it to set an example. So did Benjamin Franklin, leaders 
and people that call themselves “justice”... they’re not going to ignore when SCSO attempts to murder a civilian.
So, if Teddy Roosevelt is punchin’ somebody in the face, he’s puttin’ everything he’s got into it. 
Luckily, I’m not a president, cause I’d fire you for being careless.   

If this dude truly wanted to earn my respect and not be embarrassed, he could give himself an air of credibility 
by asking me actual questions about the murder attempt that these fuckin’ idiots at SCSO facilitated. But- I 
don’t want to make any assumptions, I’m fairly certain that those kids need to be killed. Won’t be me that 
kills them either, it’ll be the state, or the MILITIA. 

I’m aware of this hidden government. I’m also aware that I might’ve stepped on a number of toes, but, heh. 
Someone stepped on my toes and didn’t think anything of it. That’s ok man. I’ll just fuckin’ write another 
story like the one above, come back while you’re asleep, and just make sure that my nutsack and her ass is 
as close to your fuckin’ face as possible... It’s probably gonna be annoying if I keep goin’ back there and

But the police do not enforce them, nor do they investigate* them.                       (← Not even fuckin’ kidding)
Especially if they commit* them.                                                         (← Not even fuckin’ kidding)
At some point, they may investigate* them if it has an associated DOLLAR AMOUNT.

Or, they may finally start investigating something when someone keeps making a fuckin’ stink after all.
Regardless, I’ve never seen anything quite as severe as either one of these incidents

Rank        : 1
Date        : January 15th, 2019 
Type        : CVE-2019-8936 
Info        : WANNACRY DERIVATIVE RANSOMWARE ATTACK
Sort        : Could be considered a FELONY by a (cop/investigator/judge)
Description : I believe this was a secondary attack that had a PIGGYBACK off of a PRIOR use of the Phantomware 
              package below. As in, there are (3) fuckin’ ways this could’ve happened.

(1) My phone had Pegasus already deployed to it, at or about October 1Xsh, 2018. [at or about Paul Allens death]
    I think this is the case because I mentioned something about it happening DAYS before the event below...
    in a recording I called “The Live Redaction Program”, basically LIVE censorship, for social media.
    Similar to FACEBOOK, but A LOT MORE ADVANCED than that. 
    It’s not like FACEBOOK isn’t ADVANCED, either, it is.
    HOWEVER, it’s SOURCE CODE has an excess of > 1 MILLION characters in (1) line, that’s “ADVANCED”, alright.
    Like, I live a good 2mi + → 5 Enterprise Ave, if I open up the FACEBOOK Source code, those characters would
    easily extend well past the edge of my monitor, go that WHOLE distance... into the horizon.
    That means, NOT WELL WRITTEN.
    FACEBOOK was DUPLICATING some of my POSTS, I’d SUBMIT a post and whoa- 3x copies of it were on my news feed.
    That’s mainly because FACEBOOK was TAKING some of my IDEAS, cause some COCKSUCKER thinks that those IDEAS
    are THEIRS for the TAKING. AKA, somebody who considers me to be PROPERTY was INVESTIGATING me.
    I also saw these same DUPLICATED UPLOADS or ACTIONS, in May 2020. Below.
(2) There is the possibility that when I opened port 3389 for like 10 minutes if not less...
    that somebody got in.
    Pretty sure that’s not what happened.
(3) I believe there was a remote party in Rochester or Syracuse who was using an iPad to connect to the 
    network with TeamViewer. I noticed some strange shit at or about that time. I think Precision Periodontics 
    had something to do with that. Before I wouldn’t have called out a company like theirs and said 
    “Hey, HIPAA leakage...” 
    There are multiple associations with Precision Periodontics actually. 
    Cause I kinda went back there, or at least 146A on May 23rd 2020.

Info        : Most dangerous spyware application in the world | DEADLY
Sort        : Could be considered several FELONIES by a (cop/investigator/judge)
Description : Phantomware is when someone uses a program to commandeer your APPLE or Android device.

0 click sometimes, no user interaction, remains persistent, and low key. (Like Ted Bundy, the serial killer)
If you’re a gay guy, and don’t want people to KNOW how gay you are? Then you will think to use this program.
There was nothing really low key about the activity I was seeing at or about this date, which is WHY I walked
to (SANG/Stratton Air National Guard) a few days BEFORE I started walking all over town.

I really could SHOW people how fuckin’ moronic the guy who runs SCSO is, right...?
SCSO-2020-002998 → I sorta knew a PROGRAM was on my device PRIOR to this event, but I’m surrounded by MORONS.
^ Yeah, this ticket number above is from (05/19/20). 

My stepfather LAUGHED AT ME, when I said: 
“I think someone is planning to kill me, they’ve been stalking me, I’ve seen them about a dozen times”, well...

I had already put a fair amount of thought into the idea... “MAYBE some asshole is using my DEVICE to stalk me.”
His main question that he asked FACETIOUSLY that night was “What would anyone want with a low-life degenerate 
piece of shit like you...?” (← Cause, stepdad... I think that my FATHER was EXECUTED by the SAME PEOPLE)

Anyone who reads that will probably think “THAT IS A DAMN GOOD REASON, ACTUALLY...”
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(3,"Recordings",@"
The COOL thing is, I sorta had a clue that someone was listening to me as far back as January 29th, 2020, OR BEFORE.
But it eventually BECAME a THREATENING PROPSPECT, because I couldn’t EXPLAIN WHY I SUSPECTED what I was SEEING.
I suppose I should go back and review the audio logs I recorded on May 19th, 20th, 21st 2020 …
Said plenty of stuff about a lot of people in those logs, because I was simply throwing everything I could into 
them, since I just had a hunch. You can’t go to the police and say “Someone is stalking me on my smartphone.”
Because they won’t actually give a shit. They’ll laugh at you and say “You must’ve done something to deserve it.”

Sometimes I don’t care to listen to the recordings, as I outgrow some of my (ideas/rhetoric). Sometimes it is more
useful than confiding in people, or even discussing these things with a DOCTOR, or LAWYER, or POLICE OFFICER... 
I don’t listen to recordings I’ve made and have a blast, “OH HERE’S HOW AWESOME I ONCE WAS~!”. That’s moronic.
But, sometimes those recordings contain actual CLUES, and USING THEM allowed me to EXPOSE these SERIAL KILLERS.

I recorded a bunch of stuff and sent this girl Tati, I had a crush on in high school. (← had a good reason)
Wrote a fuckin’ 42 page handwritten letter, talked about a lot of the stuff in this document.
Maybe I should’ve asked HER if she likes the idea of chokin’ on a fat D.
MAYBE what I was experiencing, was a STALKER who wanted to choke on it, instead of her.

I’m not tryin’ to bring up the fuckin’ past, but what the hell man... 
Seems like whatever I do, I am a total fuckface. Not allowed to be HUMAN and make mistakes...
 
Might as well just... give up. Find the nearest rock... and just, live underneath one for the rest of my days.

She was fuckin’ hot a long time ago and she probably STILL is, and … that is a hurdle, right? Best word. 
Hurdle, cause I have no doubt that I may have said some stuff that she … would definitely be down with. 

The point being, people can’t just stick around and “Hope” all the time that something which happened in the 
Past, was finally resolved by making some admissions… cause that’s moronic, gotta move on and live your life.

The problem is that there are ALTERNATE reasons that she is a critical part of this story. I’ll explain later.

The way I see it, I was really opening up a can of worms after I started the business in 10/18
I didn’t expect to get thrown off onto several tangents... 

Learned a lot, but, what did I do for the planet. SCCM is already good enough, so is MDT. 
I learned how to overlay logic and class structures and then start writing a bunch of stuff...
...and throw in some comedy, but who’s gonna pay for all that...? 

Pretty sure that I pissed off all people at Microsoft and Nfrastructure, just by existing...

Microsoft     : This dude exists man... Idk... 
Nfrastructure : Yeah he definitely exists bro. 
                He really could take things to the next level if he … somehow gets some traction.
Microsoft     : Well, he does say that we’re the worlds best software engineers... 
                That’s gotta count for somethin’. 
                He’s not wrong there...
Nfrastructure : Nope, he is... not wrong. 
                He’s right on the money man...
                So, what’s his issue...?
Microsoft     : I think he’s still waxing on, and waxing off... 
                Mr. Miyagi’s car, he said... “You do that until I get back...” 
                Now it’s *checks watch* 3 years man. 
                Holy fuck. 
Nfrastructure : Dude has been waxing on, and waxing off... for 3 years...? 
Microsoft     : Yeah man. 
                Dude never gave up. 
Nfrastructure : Huh. Well... *shakes head* 
                Look, maybe he hasn’t learned the lesson yet.

Too bad neither of these companies understand the connection between my father and at least 1x Pickett.
I said a number of things about JJ Lavery, Microsoft, John Pickett*, Matt Caldwell, Scott Salvadore...
...the thing I’d been piecing together/building, there’s always been a theme where NOTHING seems to happen 
when I’m cautious or keeping to myself, but these (3) audio recordings I had made as I was taking pictures 
of the fiber optic cables around town. 

If this whole entire document reveals anything at all, is that I usually have a good reason to think some 
of the things I do, and if it feels like it’s off base, I stop talking about it. Something I had to deal 
with, was having a feeling that the SCSO vehicles were driving around the Firehouse off of 146

I had a suspicion that I was being heard by someone that has access to this fuckin’ thing... 
Compilation: Bird https://youtu.be/zXkmxtYQ6wQ

The above link is a video of a compilation I made of the thing I recorded multiple instances of. 
I’m not entirely sure what I’m supposed to say or do to get out of this bubble, but I know I’m in one and 
have been in it for a while, because of how obvious they make it – when I say bubble, I mean, I know I’m 
being AGGRESSIVELY CENSORED → That does NOT MEAN IT IS LEGAL TO DO THAT.

Then I get somebody like Dwayne to come around, and he’s like:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Dwayne : Oh yeah...? 
         *scoffs* Mike uploaded a new video, eh...? 
         Well, let’s just check it out.
         ...hit the fuck you button, and take off...~!

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

^ That’s how (Dwayne/Pavel) has always been. 
Idk man, maybe I was a dumbass that whole time. If I was so smart, I wouldn’t have constantly ran circles 
around this dude, so now I’ll have plenty of time to think about how I should’ve slowed the fuck down...
Maybe I’m not even going to try and manipulate anybody about anything, cause, the bottom line could be 
that I should’ve asked more girls if they wanna choke on a fat D. It’s not really that offensive when 
you’re really blatant about it, they’re not gonna say “Huh...? What’s a big fat D...?!?” 

Then you gotta say “D stands for ‘dick’.” Then they might be like oblivious like Melanie strikes me:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Melanie : A fat dick, eh...? 
          Like, a dude named Dick...? 
          Like, Dick Clarke? 
          Host of the `$25K Pyramid
Me      : Nah. 
          He wasn’t fat...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I dunno, never met this woman I don’t think, but that is how Dwayne characterized this lady.
Go to the mall, and pretend fart out loud and just say to each other “HOLY FUCK DUDE.” then just walk away.

That is something I would probably laugh my ass off over. I still laugh when I think about it.
Dwayne wasn’t a TOTAL douchebag, BUT- idk I guess I really was very rude to do all of that work that he 
didn’t have to do, because he made a lot more money when I did that... So, I’m an asshole for screwing that up.
What I should’ve done what HE did... Lie to (most people/everybody), and don’t put any effort into anything.
Just, date some rich girl like Melanie, and then just use that alone to make connections with people.

Yeah, I get it, guys like Daniel Pickett are gonna get pretty upset because I might’ve said some shit that 
pissed him off, or Dwayne, him too... but why not talk about it...? Ya know...?

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Dwayne : Nah... Bro, I don’t have to appease YOU...
Me     : Look dude, don’t you wish you made more money doing what you do...? 
Dwayne : Ehhhh I make plenty.
Me     : You and I both know, I could literally, walk in at any moment... 
         ...and immediately, the second I walk in the door... 
         ...immediately find something to make the business more efficient again...
         ...and then double your sales.
Dwayne : *sneers*

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

He knows this ^ | So does Daniel Pickett
The DIFFERENCE between these (2) guys, is that DANIEL never screwed me over, his BROTHER and Matt Caldwell did.
Unless I’m wrong about that TOO.

I don’t quite understand why people do this, where, as long as they sound like they’re bein’ mad 
friendly, then who gives a shit what you do to somebody...? 
I’m not gonna throw Daniel Pickett in the same camp as Dwayne Coonradt.

Look. The sound of the bird begins at about 35s into the video. 
I was shooting for getting them all into the same video, because, hey... 
…someone seems to think I don’t have legitimate evidence of somebody sending that thing that doesn’t 
sound like a natural bird at all. I can understand if that thing is actually a weapon, and maybe somebody 
was using it to try and bait me, cause it ALMOST worked. 

But at the same time, I had a gut feeling that this thing was WARNING me … of something dangerous goin’ on. 
When I walked to Stratton, maybe they get hundreds of people showing up with something like this, and they 
gotta get ya on a list where you aren’t even allowed to be seen by other people.    (← CENSORSHIP ACTUALLY HAPPENING)

Who gives a shit if that bird in these videos isn’t an actual bird...? Ya know?
Cause I’ll likely get somebody to smack the “fuck you” button on it...

But hey. That shit might be hard to google search, so, whatever man. 
All’s I’m sayin’, is that *I* supported *my* family, AS WELL AS Pavel’s fuckin’ daughter and HIM, 
Lester’s fuckin’ family, Dahl’s family, Alex’s family...

I FUCKIN WORKED MY ASS OFF FOR THIS COCKSUCKER AND HE OWED ME OVER `$4K. 
THEN, after I started my company, he SABOTAGED MY WORK. 

This dude, knew damn well, that I generated more profit for that company than 1) him or 2) vice president, 
every single month that I worked there. 
The reason why, is because I am a smart son of a bitch. 

Not sure if that’s EVIDENT.
But hey. Maybe when these people use these ADVANCED EXPLOITS... 
...they just USE them because they don’t know how to MAKE them, so SKILL OR TALENT isn’t even NECESSARY for these 
fucks to have. (might blow up in their face)

Nah, mom and dad bought em a deadly fuckin’ program called (Pegasus/Phantom), and then... 
They’re committing murders with Michael Zurlo. I’m not even remotely fuckin’ kiddin’ about that.

Idk man, sometimes I wish I was able to talk to Melanie Goldstein directly, and tell her what a 
fuckin’ scumbag Dwayne is. She might not even care... Which cool, I fuckin’ ran circles around her 
fuckin’ lazy ass boyfriend who steals stuff from customers and software distributors, and he got jealous 
that I was consistently running circles around his ass, every day.

Day in -> day out, “Oh, what am I gonna do TODAY, *checks watch* run additional LAPS around Dwayne...? Yep.”
It was actually rather embarrassing when Dwayne found out that I actually met Pavel LONG before his ass did. 

Yeah. I’m sure Daniel Pickett AIN’T TOO PLEASED about some of the shit I managed to say...
Because, hey these people... they’re too scared to say who they are when they attack people. (They’re from SHEN)

That’s cause they need the element of surprise, they’re too afraid to come out in the open and have a nutsack. 
Daniel, might not be a bad dude after all. 
He wasn’t a bad dude when I worked for him...? 

But my god, when Matt Caldwell had Kristen Stangle fire me, I walked into Dennis Schillings office 
and I said, “You’re a spineless cocksucker, buddy. Thought you were tough as nails...?”
This is a dude who was in the Navy, for Desert Storm or something. 
He was actually was a pretty cool guy until he started being a dick to me cause he didn’t realize I was tryin’ 
to do my job one day and he snapped at me. 

I didn’t quite tell Kristen Stangle that I wanted to turn her around, rip her skirt down, and go to town... 
...bang the snot out of her just like in that story above... 
She was pretty fuckin’ hot... and there was always some tension like that between her and I, 
that I had to wave off cause I had a 6 month old child... 

It is bullshit when a girl FIRES YOU for a DUDE who had to like cower in fear from halfway across the building… 
At least being fired was somewhat enjoyable, in the sense that she was still mad hot when she decided to do that…
I never once thought that MATT was hot. Her…? Definitely. Him…? Definitely fucking not. Even the girl in the NOC, 
she was hot too. Can’t remember her name. Anyway…

Suppose I told her there and then, just waltzed in, and just asked her:

Of course we’re talkin’ like *checks watch* 11 years ago, so people definitely change a lot.
I’m recalling a moment where I got fired... none of that stuff was on either of our minds at all. 
At least not on that particular day. 

I never spoke to her like that... 
But obviously I’m still somewhat considerate even in retrospect, ya know?

Who cares if Matt Caldwell would walk into the warehouse naked, having shaved his pubes into the shape of a 
heart, like she would probably do... I know these people heard some variations of what I was saying on 
Facebook, because I had a feeling someone was keeping eyes on me that whole period of time. 

Had no idea that my father somehow knew Jesse from Hudson Valley Community College, my father brought me with 
him a couple times when my mother worked at Dobbs International, and I don’t remember much of it, but I think 
they were in a class or something together.

Look. Melanie Goldstein was probably real pissed that I went and tried to tell her that Dwayne lied to my 
customers and ripped me off, cause he has face to save with her father who owns all the dealerships and the 
bondsman thing I believe. Or at least they did.

Melanie thought I was an idiot one day when I started posting lyrics to fuckin’ “Whoomp, there it is”, bro. 
On Dwayne’s post or whatever. Fine. 
Not everything I post is gonna cause people to piss in their socks. 
That’s why I keep at it. 

Look, I guess even if this ISN’T really a part of a story about the Constitution of the United States of America, 
and the Bill of Rights, or how to FORM A MILITIA and DISASSEMBLE PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION and how to basically   
prove that I have the fuckin’ ability to earn a MASTERS DEGREE by doing so... 

I really don’t particularly enjoy how some people … 
...think I’m gonna allow myself to be a victim, because that ain’t happenin’.
I mean, I’ll BE a victim, but I’ll ALSO put my dick in some dude’s girlfriend OR wife, for underestimating me.
...and I’ll load her up too. 

She’ll probably ask for more.

Yeah, so, it’s literally ME versus *check everything*. Probably isn’t that severe at all, but, it is rather 
severe. Basically everybody that has something to say about me, resents the fact that I’m someone they 
probably enjoy hating or despising, or resenting for some reason. And you know what...? Fine. 
I’ll fuckin’ tell Ms. Stangle what happens next in that scene...

Me      : I can’t visualize it. 
          He’s too clean cut all the time, has high standards.

          We’re not talkin’ about some rag-tag computer shop...
Me      : Nah, we’re talkin about somebody at the top of the local industry.

So the suspense between this woman and I, it’s there... For sure. 
People might not be able to see that necessarily...? But- that depends on the tone. 
What if she’s using a lot of eyebrow movements and can’t help herself but smile... 

Well, this is actually a pretty good way to SEGUE into a slightly relevant topic...

$Book.AddSection(3,"Body Language",@"
If someone of the opposite sex happens to be having a conversation with you that goes a lot like that...? 
It’s cause both of those people probably want to break the suspense somehow. People ought to scope out how
basically every dialog James Bond has with a woman... in basically EVERY James Bond movie... Sorta fuckin’
goes exactly like that prior skit.

So, you can’t be super descriptive about what that means because then you’ve lost the element of surprise, 
can’t just go blabbing about something that has a level of suspense to it, because, there’s a chance that the 
story might be a bit more tantalizing than the one where I’m just already banging some mad hot girl on 
Judge Pelagalli’s bed. He’s was cool with that though, from what I wrote. 

Cause, you’re not supposed to let the cat out of the bag, until you know what you’re really dealing with.
Why...? Well, there may be differing levels of RESPECT or even a hidden element of MALICE. 
Can’t just ruin the fun, nor declare that there’s some potentially evil shit goin on...    (← that’s not in the skit)

However... There are some subtle psychological cues that can be seen in the dialog.
For instance, answering a question with a question, is a pretty good thing to pick up on. 

It’s not LOADED with that, however if someone is saying something very trivial, like, 
“That’s friggen Mr. Pickett’s office right there, isn’t it...?” And they say “Yeah bro.” 

Well, obviously, can’t be doin’ stuff near his office, cause I’d have enough respect for HIM and HER.
But, good luck trying to convey that while accomplishing multiple goals in tandem.     (← Sometimes it’s too obvious)

Style and word choice, probably made that scene a bit more tense than it appears, then again.
maybe the dialog sucks ass... but everyone’s gonna have a different opinion about it. 
Pretty sure it’s plenty good. 

Maybe she’s conveying in the dialog that I should be more AGGRESSIVE in the conversation.
Ya know? Maybe she wants to hear, “Wanna choke on a big fat D?”

She probably DOES wanna hear something like that, but, having RESPECT for other people, and being CONSIDERATE 
is how I’ve always been until someone has sorta screwed me over...

The truth is, you really don’t want to let the cat out of the bag, as that is the element of surprise.

$Book.AddSection(3,"Analogy [~] The cat’s outta the bag",@"
You can say things that might cause the cat to pop it’s head out of the bag, and look around...
Now the cat sees ya. Cat goes “Meow”, maybe the cat’s hungry- and it needs to be fed.

But, you can’t just go ahead and feed every cat that occasionally pops their head out of the bag... 
...cause that would be insanity. 
Think about how many cans of cat food you’d have to carry around with ya, to feed em all. 

Doesn’t mean you can’t play with the idea of asking questions about what might happen... 
...if the cat popped it’s head out of the bag, was hungry, and you were willing to feed the cat. 

Will the cat say “Nah. Fuck that, bro...” and then go back into the bag...? 
Or will the cat lick it’s lips, say “Oh wow! I’m comin’ out alright~!.” and come all the way out...?
People really should consider that the cat may have different emotions day-to-day.

The answer is that, once a cat makes its way out of any bag at all...? 
It can’t go back in without a damn good reason.
And if it does come out, then it stands to reason that it’s an opportunity that needs to be capitalized on.
Otherwise, who the hell even are ya...?

Maybe the cat was starving, and would occasionally come out for a bit... 
Whether it was starving for attention, or actually hungry, who knows...? (You’ll know)

Sometimes you might even be left with a situation where the cat won’t tell anybody about how often it’d come 
out of the bag, and destroy entire stacks of cans of cat food... (If the cat is eating the food, there’s a 
chance that its gonna stick around. But that can change...)

Maybe one say, maybe you looked at the cat the wrong way or somethin’...

Even if you have all these empty cans of cat food...? That cat was kinda rude.
“Oh, the cat food just ate itself, didn’t it...?”
They’re not all like that at all... but some of them definitely are.                         (← what divorce is like)

Well, who’s REALLY gonna expect that cat to put their paw on a friggen bible, and swear to tell the truth, 
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help it god... when asked about eating all that food...?
Nobody in history, has ever had a cat, swear to do all that. I can tell ya its not realistic either.

Even if the cat says anything at all, cat might say “Bro, I’d never eat THAT dude’s cat food. Fuck outta here...”
BUT-, if the cat food was AWESOME AS FUCK... they’re gonna be like

      Not even gonna deny that.

$Book.AddSection(3,"Respect is a TWO-WAY-STREET (1)",@"
Look respect is a TWO WAY STREET, and even disrespecting someone YOU might think could never matter ever, in 
the world, at any point in time, space, existence...? 

Someone might fuckin’ make an example out of *points* you. 
They won’t do that if they don’t have a damn good reason.

When people to FAIL to realize that RESPECT is in fact, a (← TWO WAY STREET →) ...?
Well, make sure you get your point across in a way where people will be A LOT MORE CAREFUL...

Someone misspelling an address or a SCSO plate number may not indicate that person is 
INTENTIONALLY fucking that up. So it is easy to see how that is a MISTAKE.

However, what about NON-MISTAKES...?

Sometimes people may not realize that there may be a PUNISHMENT for making CERTAIN MISTAKES.
Sometimes CERTAIN MISTAKES are NON-MISTAKES.
For instance, UNDERESTIMATION is a pretty shitty NON-MISTAKE to make... 

So, if things like NON-MISTAKES are detected, that causes a PATTERN to form.    

So for instance, if I write down the owner of Trickshot Billiards and Wicked, Timothy Berlin’s 
personal cell phone number 518-944-6X9X, and then distribute this material all around the state of 
New York, he’s gonna have to wind up changing his phone number when thousands of people start 
calling him every day, if they run through all those possibilities right there...

“Hey, I saw this phone number in this cool book I read... one where a guy who lives down the street 
from ya wrote.”

So, then Tim’s gonna be ANNOYED, that someone with 0 dollars to his name, found a way to manipulate 
him again. He won’t be the only one being manipulated though... 

However NON-MISTAKES are pretty easy to avoid.
UNDERESTIMATION is a pretty HUGE, NON-MISTAKE people might make.
Still, people will call him and have a conversation like this...

Tim has relatively a LOT LESS to worry about than someone who is a county sheriff, like Michael Zurlo.
But I suspect that these two have had DIRECT INVOLVEMENT SOMEHOW, typically when you’re in an AREA...
...where you’re near somebody’s PROPERTY, BUSINESS, or even BOTH... it’s not a bad assumption to make.
Same goes with DWAYNE COONRADT.

Though, suspicions change quite often. Maybe all of the people I’ve mentioned, had nothing to do with 
anything, anywhere, ever. 

Dwayne Coonradt have had conversations with this guy Michael Zurlo, and maybe even Dan Pickett.
Maybe Daniel Pickett and Tim Berlin, they hang out and play pool sometimes.

DWAYNE COONRADT have had conversations with this guy MICHAEL ZURLO, and maybe even DANIEL PICKETT (UNLIKELY).
OR, maybe DANIEL PICKETT thinks DWAYNE COONRADT is a REAL cocksucker, too (PLAUSIBLE). 

I’m not putting any words in the guy’s mouth or anything, *hands up* I’m just sayin’, sounds PLAUSIBLE to me.

However, I have nothing to adamantly conclude as such.
DWAYNE COONRADT and PAVEL ZAICHENKO JR. would say “I’ll smack the shit out of you, bro...”
If you think I’m even remotely kidding, I am slightly exaggerating.

PAVEL ZAICHENKO JR. used to be a mixed-martial arts fighter, and... he would tell me all the time: 
_______________________________________________________

|         ...you’ll shit your pants, bro.             |

But then if YOU are like me, and you know that PAVEL might get caught with a rather unexpected blow to the 
temple if he decided to do that...? And, you keep that to yourself for a really long time, running HIS 
company...? ...instead of like, HIM doin’ that...? (running HIS company...)
...attempting to run that business as if it were your own...? 
...generating more profit for the business than HIM, or anyone else...? 
...watching the guy collect the lock box content...? 
...while that dude spends NO TIME teaching the other employees the things I was trying to teach them...?

Well, at some point you might say to this dude who’s twice your size:

PAVEL constantly (said/did) stuff that caused me to think... “This dude strikes me as bisexual or somethin’...”
DWAYNE never ever ONCE gave me that impression.
Might be a bit of a lying cocksucker here and there, but... never really thought “Oh, he might be a little gay.”

It’s not like I was completely innocent in terms of me not expressing “Oh, I’ll hit ya dude...”
Cause, I said shit to him to manipulate him plenty of times.
But, things came to a head back in October 2018. PRECISION PERIODONTICS, and the SCHENECTADY store.

PAVEL, was trying to be slick, and he wasn’t fooling me.

I am exaggerating, because all of them combined is a lot of money. 
It didn’t change the fact that I was the best salesman and technician in the company.

Anyway, I have to consider that when I am open and honest with people, that some people will actually EXPLOIT 
me, for choosing to do that. My dad was shot to death when I was a kid, so that must make it ok for people to 
go ahead and exploit ME, right...? Well, no because when I do it in return, it’s a whole different ballgame... 
they don’t like that.

The reason that they don’t like when I do it, is because if I decide to manipulate someone, I’m gonna use 
techniques that sound like I was hiding an insane person that whole entire time... The truth is, I will 
remember the things that people said to me, exploiting me, treating me like I was garbage, and all of the 
most manipulative things I can think of, will surface.

MAYBE, I’ll apologize to this dude Tim Berlin, at some point. I never went remotely far with him.
Stephen Leon found that out the hard way. I dwelled on that shit for days.
Pavel found out the hard way, I dwelled on that too. 
So did Matt Caldwell.

These people just don’t realize that I will actually kick the shit out of a man for treating me like that.
It won’t be for a ridiculous reason, it’ll out of sheer principle.
And, I will translate that ass kicking to mental strategies if they’re not gonna be a man and put up their fists.

That’s the ol’ RESPECT IS A TWO WAY STREET situation.
People can manipulate me or lie to me, or treat me however they please, but when I return the favor... 
I happen to cause people extreme fear SOMEHOW.

At least, even if I feel like flirting with Kristen Stangle in a dialog, I’m still not going to disrespect 
her in that particular story, because she did nothing to deserve being disrespected, Matt did. 

HOWEVER, that may not be the case in reference to someone that’s EARNED that status where I will casually or 
even aggressively insult someone. Insults I’ll cover shortly...

As it stands, telling Paul Zurlo that I stole a package off of his porch... is a PRINCIPLE that pisses me 
off. Among other things. Cause I didn’t. I sure as hell remember that, don’t I? It’s because the PRINCIPLE
is what left a permanent impression. Because the way I see it, if I tell somebody that a couple of fuckin’ 
queers tried to murder me, or if my neighbor provided false testimony to Mark Sheehan on June 13th, 2020, 
well... nobody does a fuckin’ thing HELPFUL.

Mark Sheehan “helped” me alright, he fuckin’ saw me treadin’ water in the ocean, and tossed me a brick.
But that’s not really HIS FAULT, that Saratoga Hospital has a dude that literally could be blowing dudes 
randomly every day, in the Mental Health Unit, and for some reason... nobody fuckin’ gives a shit.

I think the reason why, is because some people like Tim Berlin can casually lie to people, and convince 
Paul Zurlo to come to MY FUCKIN HOUSE... accusing me of stealing a package. Rather than anyone at SCSO 
investigating someone who tried to murder me outside of Tim Berlin’s property on May 26th, 2020.
Purple Samsung Galaxy S9+ may have been owned by a VICTIM of this serial killer, in all seriousness.

Someone attempting to murder somebody else is worth getting really pissed about.
That’s why Michael Zurlo doesn’t feel like he has to talk to me.

Which means that if I would like to have a conversation with this guy, I will have to FORM A MILITIA and 
just show up someday at his office. Probably does not sound like a good situation if I suspect that he 
had something to do, with facilitating an attempted murder near Catricala Funeral Home, Computer Answers,
Trickshot Billiards... (05/25/20 2343 → 05/26/20 0004).

Most people may not realize that I have multiple reasons to suspect that Michael Zurlo would do that.
And the way it appears to me, is that he hopes that I lose my cool.
I SUSPECT that MICHAEL ZURLO, MAY have been the one driving the blue truck.                      (← Maybe not though)

So I have to draw up a CORRELATION between him possibly being a Russian spy...
...or, like GEORGE LAZENBY, following orders from his majesty’s service.
I SUSPECT, that MICHAEL ZURLO has had a lot of people killed... and there’s a lot of other agencies that do 
that too.

Luckily for Tim, I just think he had a lapse in judgment of my character from his perspective (if that isn’t 
fuckin’ obvious), and that this repeated itself as a PATTERN. I do not suspect Tim Berlin would be like 
“Alright, lets kill this motherfucker.” Cause I had respect for Tim Berlin for a real long time. But, respect 
is a (← TWO WAY STREET →). Speaking of TED ETOLL, he’s a cool guy, and although he’s never screwed me over,
his business partner at Lou Communications/Metroland STEPHEN LEON certainly did.

$Book.AddSection(3,"Story [~] Ted Etoll, Lou Communications/Metroland",@"
I worked for over 7 years at Lou Communications. Ted, was actually the owner of Metroland, and didn’t feel 
like calling the shots, he just paid Stephen Leon to run Metroland. Stephen Leon, wasn’t always a bad guy, but 
sometimes he’d be a condescending dickhead that needed to be pulled down several pegs.

This guy KARL, who like, somehow took over for Michelle, was the guy they chose to replace Michelle. That sorta 
upset me but whatever. I called Karl to see if the money was in the account so I could cash my check. 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Karl  : Yeah bro. 
        The money’s there. 
Me    : Alright. 
        Cool. 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
    
I go pick up the check/papers, immediately went to Citizen’s Bank to cash it.
You’ll never fuckin’ believe THIS, but guess what...? 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Clerk : Fuck you, buddy.
Me    : *mortified, delay* Pardon me...?
Clerk : You heard me.
        *hands it back to me* This fuckin’ check is BOGUS, bro.
        Computer screen is LITERALLY telling me “Insufficient funds in the account.”
        Who the HELL do YOU think you’re foolin’...?
        Huh, tough guy...?
Me    : Uh... 
        ...that’s my paycheck.
Clerk : Nah, bro. 
        Don’t be playin’ games like that. 
        Just cause it says some company name here, doesn’t mean that it’s a REAL check...
        You get on outta here, or... 
        I’ll climb over this god damn counter, and smack ya senseless.
Me    : Dude. 
        I come here every week to cash this thing...
Clerk : Says you.
Me    : ...you cashed it last week...
Clerk : I don’t remember you.
Me    : Bro, I even have the damn stub ya gave me...
Clerk : It’s probably fake. 
        Just like this “check”...
Me    : *sigh* Alright. 
        Fine. 
        Whatever bro.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

The clerk said nothing of the sort, they’d definitely get fired for that.
Just trying to make it sound cooler. However, the context is accurate.

So, time to go to the building they moved the office to off of Western Ave.
I had to go have a fuckin’ conversation with this dude, Stephen Leon, in his office. 
I walked right into the office, and said: “Hey. My check wouldn’t clear. What gives...?”

Stephen Leon actually thought that I was just being annoying.
Probably didn’t realize I was pretty fuckin’ pissed.
A lot more pissed off than usual, normally I would’ve found some other way to get by for a day or two.
However, Metroland had some serious issues with finances.

Ted Etoll did not have serious issues with finances. 
Etoll had plenty of money, and he was a pretty cool guy.
He didn’t feel like throwing money at Stephen if he couldn’t sustain the company.
Stephen saw me standing in his office.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Leon : Oh well, here’s … fuckin’ IDK bro, like 8 bucks, here ya go.
       Make sure this never happens again.
Me   : Thanks. (Ok fuckface. I’ll make damn certain of it.)

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I then drove home and left the papers I was supposed to distribute in my vehicle for like 3 days 
until Michelle Rathke calls me, and says “Hey. Sup Mike?”

She was not the problem in the least. Had a real good working relationship with this lady. I kept a lot of 
things under the radar over the 7 years that I made every effort to sustain the company’s bottom line. 

Exactly like what I did at Nfrastructure, Times Union, Mild Wally’s, Spinners, and Computer Answers.

But- you know, pretty sure she would’ve taken offense if I said “Yeah, Stephen Leon’s a cocksucker.”
She called to say “I’ve gotten a few complaints, people are telling me that they didn’t get the paper...?”

Then I say “Yeah it’s cause I didn’t feel like delivering them. Still don’t.”
Then she knew what was up, but she probably didn’t know the part where I was about to knock this fuckin’ 
ungrateful prick out, for like, waving me off the way he did.

You’re not really allowed to tell people “Here’s your paycheck.” And then when you get to the bank, the check 
doesn’t clear. That is actually illegal. But this cocksucker did that all the time.

The reason why I put up with it for so long, is because I cared about the company a lot at one point.
But the thing is, at some point people need to be insulted like Stephen Leon insulted ME that day... by 
saying: “Make sure this never happens again.”

Ah. Ok fuckface. I made damn certain of it.

$Book.AddSection(3,"Insults",@"
INSULTS are EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE, when people CARE about their REPUTATION
On the contrary, if you aggressively insult somebody you will earn the reputation of someone that lacks respect.
But, most people won’t understand WHY, nor will they CARE why...

There might be a damn good reason for someone to be insulted, and the reputation of someone that appears to LACK 
respect is COMMANDING THAT THEY BE RESPECTED. Doesn’t mean people should go around insulting people for no    
“compelling” reason. There are plenty of people that do that, and then people try to say that’s what I do. Nah. I 
don’t go around insulting people unless they DID something, to deserve that.

For instance, I have an email conversation with the ASUS Corporation, because they have actual morons that work 
there. In their Support Department, R&D Department, Human Resources... cause if I go to install chipset drivers 
for a device that Asus made, that has a PROCESSOR AND CHIPSET THAT THEY MADE... Then it should work. No fuckin’ 
excuse whatsoever. 

So, if I download the CORRECT chipset drivers for that particular device, DIRECTLY from Intel’s website... 
...and then go to install those drivers, then the program should not have an installation error like: 
“This installation is not supported by this processor type.” Cause the processor in the laptop was specifically
listed for that specific package and it was not supported. The reason WHY, is because they put the firmware for 
the UX560 in the spot where the Q504UA UEFI/BIOS was. 

And, they were attempting to manipulate me into sending my device in for a “return merchandise authorization.”
Well, the people at Asus, will show me repeatedly that they don’t know how to fuckin’ read.
I mean, they actually get offended when I tell them the truth “Been doin’ this a lot longer than you, fuckface.”

Yeah, I have a video of this shit. Asus has actual morons there. Not only have I fuckin’ bought Asus products...
...since *checks watch* like 1998, with a P3V4X motherboard, but I also sorta had a fuckin’ clue about how 
these programs, drivers, and chipset packages work, going way back to like 1996.

These programs weren’t as complex as they are today, but... if you have hardware that says “Intel” and you 
go to download drivers from “Intel”, then, they should work, every fucking time. But- Asus kept trying to 
say “OooOOoooHhh bro, gotta download the drivers from our support site, not theirs.” (← Moron)

Most people don’t just start saying shit to people for no fuckin’ reason. 
Someone like myself that has MORE certifications than a guy who owns a computer repair shop, contacts an agency 
like Asus, and they feed me a line of bullshit... I have to let them know “I’m an actual expert dipshit. Used to 
make warranty calls when I worked at Nfrastructure. I called Hewlett Packard and Dell on a nearly every day 
basis to get warranty parts shipped to the warehouse.”

But if I say something like that to Linus Sebastian, that I did this shit long before you ever even had a 
“whole room water cooling project”... that should tell you that I know what the fuck I’m saying/doing, and even 
what cool shit YOU’RE doing, too. (← probably gonna confuse some people, that I’m insulting AND complimenting in 
a single sentence... But, it should make plenty of sense, actually.)

If the person refuses to do so (provide someone respect or just general, all around, not treating an expert with   
respect), there’s an actual chance of a physical confrontation at some point. Pavel will probably be happy to go
that route, he’s not a wimp like people think. Just has a bit of an “occasional sausage wrecker” vibe sometimes.  

And THAT’S when they act afraid of somebody.
Yeah. Basically, they really don’t like the fact that mommy and daddy bought all their shit till they had a 
really nice business or reputation, right...? But they don’t like it when someone tells them that they might 
wanna consider cutting the fuckin’ attitude. Those words “mommy and daddy bought all their shit” manipulates some 
people a little too easily... cause someone that worked their ass off that got ahead, they’re gonna be far more
appreciative of the work they did for themselves, and those words don’t work at all on THEM.

In other words, someone that DESERVES RESPECT, is actually willing to provide a command.
The alternative is basically fucking that person’s girlfriend or wife, and just, makin’ her orgasm all over 
the place. Ya know? They’re gonna enjoy that. Some people deserve to be insulted, is the bottom line.

You can actually insult people and get paid a lot of money to do that if you’re not being CENSORED or limited.
Because if you ARE being censored or limited, then the solution is... 
...to acclimate the situation, by making THREATS.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(3,"Threats",@"
They differ in severity just like CENSORSHIP also ranges in severity.

Threats are seen as INDICATIVE of AGGRESSION, and therefore, society frowns upon them because they can be 
DANGEROUS. Don’t use serious threats for things that aren’t serious.

Example: Telling RICHARD TODD LOEBER that I’m surprised he hasn’t broken his own legs yet...?
That’s actually not a threat at all. 
Dude wants to commit MEDICAL FRAUD, that’s fine. That’s why I’m surprised his legs are still intact, ya know?
[Blue 2017 Audi S7 | VIN # WAUWFAFC4HN118855 | Plate # NYS/JFP-9643 ] ← That’s why I’m surprised

There’s a time and place where they become pretty fuckin’ useful, but you really need to blend in many various 
aspects of psychological manipulation so that...
    1) the person who hears it makes a favorable decision, 
    2) the words aren’t illegal, nor do they convey explicitly stated terms

Bad uses of this strategy... 
    - Threatening to KILL somebody IS BAD
    - Threatening to HURT somebody is ALSO BAD
    ------------------------------------------ … so don’t use these. 
Good uses of this strategy...
    - Being surprised that <insert name here> hasn’t <insert something a moron would do>
    - I’ll bet that <insert name>‘s (wife/girlfriend) would prefer <insert something erotic & indicative>, huh?
You can really slip in so many various terms there, or in her, or THOSE multiple hers.

Yeah, saying stuff about somebody’s female partner is usually a good way to get their attention.
Cause they might not understand the 95% success rate a strongly stated, sexually suggestive approach, has.
It’s not really a THREAT though, it’s just letting someone know that you have a real big fat one...
...and you’ll use that thing when needed. She might need it more than they think...

So saying "I will fuck your wife/girlfriend", is TECHNICALLY a threat, to the person you’re sayin’ that to...
But at the same time, the likelihood that she CRAVES that idea, is very fucking high. (it’s an exploit)

Sometimes people will ACT as if they are afraid of someone, and USE THEIR REPUTATION to cause UNDERLINGS to make 
ASSUMPTIONS, if they’ve heard something that sounded THREATENING...

There’s a difference between "making threats" and "sounding threatening"...
...but ultimately people will use the term "threatening" interchangeably.

Low:
----
 - TIM BERLIN at Trickshots not having a fuckin’ honest conversation with me about MEGHAN PURTCELL
 - Feidens, Feiden Appliance Center asking me to leave when I asked about security footage (Karel works there)

High:

 - MICHAEL ZURLO not talking to me about the incident that took place near Tim’s property

maybe the business world thinks it’s OK to roll over on as many people as possible and think nothing of it.

$Book.AddSection(3,"Cyberattacks (2)",@"
The truth is someone is using stuff that kills people, and then playing games with that stuff, and if they do 
it again, they won’t survive. Cause if they want to take the easy way out and just take someone a lot more 
talented than they are, out of the game, then just fuckin’ do it already. Why make me wait...? Ya know...? 

Like, do what that bitch Zontell Gordon did to my father, and send a bullet in my head from behind... like a 
fuckin’ coward, basically.

That’s apparently the route Michael Zurlo wants to take, so why not man...?
The truth is, nobody wants to do that anymore. 

Like, I could tell Melanie Goldstein, that I’m sorry if I hurt her feelings...
...by trying to tell her that Dwayne bangs a lot of girls that aren’t HER, in: Hotel rooms, his car. 

Maybe he doesn’t ANYMORE, but he DID...
Then he lies to HER about it, while also BRAGGING about it to everybody else, then he’ll lie to the CUSTOMERS 
about STEALING SHIT FROM THEIR COMPUTERS, or HACKING THE SOFTWARE so he doesn’t PAY FOR THE LICENSE. Ah.
This is why I get extremely frustrated with how OBLIVIOUS people in my community, REALLY ARE.

As for DWAYNE having sex with the STRIPPERS or GIRLS FROM NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS...? 
Whether they’re from Narcotics Anonymous/Ciro’s/Double Vision, that’s what he used to do when I worked with him.
That dickbag lied to EVERYBODY about ME, instead of having his fucking LEGS BROKEN. 
He should really be GRATEFUL that I never did that.

But when you’re a father of (2) children like me, you don’t necessarily wanna have sex with strippers. 
Cause that’s a questionable field of expertise where “bitches be lyin’” all the time. | ← Jay-Z, Eminem, Etc.

I hate to break it to people who might not know this, but *whispers* everybody lies.
It’s harder to tell the truth though. And that’s why life is a lot harder when you hold yourself to that.

I hate to say it, but Dwayne is a shallow bastard and this dude, has half the talent I’ve got.
Cause lets face it, maybe I was meant to be an author and eventually break the whole entire system of hidden
government. A lot of people in the business world don’t actually have talent. 

Allow me to rephrase that...
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(3,"Excerpt [~] Raw Talent",@"
There are plenty of people with (ACTUAL/RAW TALENT), that exist in the business world.
But, many of them have what’s called “ass kissing skills”.

For instance, Marquese Barnes, would spend an hour talking to a customer and make a `$30 sale.
That’s a pretty terrible use of one’s time.
You don’t really need to know what the hell you’re doing if you have “ass kissing skills”. 

Not saying Marquese was BAD at his job, he just had a problem staying MOTIVATED and TIMELY.
Like for instance, if I had to tell myself that Marquese would be the guy that made damn certain that everybody
in the company got their FULL 100% paycheck, each and every fuckin’ week that went by...?
I would laugh in this motherfuckers face, even today.

Not really HIS fault, to be 100% perfectly fucking honest.
That’s more of the [COMPANY OWNERS FAULT].
A company owner should be a lot more active than anyone else IN the company, at → educating/training people
to use their time effectively to do their job.

So, unless the owner is doing something A LOT MORE IMPORTANT...?
That is the perfect candidate that should’ve been on Marqueses’ back, saying 
“Why aren’t you bringing in enough profit...?”

I am slightly exaggerating here, however- at the same time, I’m definitely not kidding.

Regardless, if you use that as a way to offend some of those people, they will cry to their buddies and ask for 
help. But- there are far fewer people out there that have [RAW TALENT].

So like, WILLIAM GATES, perfect example of someone that has always had [RAW TALENT] 
Or, ELON MUSK, another perfect example of someone that has always had [RAW TALENT]
DWAYNE COONRADT and PAVEL ZAICHENKO have what’s called “ass kissing skills”.
Big difference. 

They EACH have a percentage of (1) versus the other (1), WILLIAM GATES has basically 100% [RAW TALENT], 
and so does ELON MUSK.
It’s not like WILLIAM GATES or ELON MUSK don’t occasionally kiss peoples asses too... 
They can do that.
But they would PREFER, to have more [RAW TALENT]... believe it or not.

Gonna go ahead and add DANIEL PICKETT into that category too, because there’s a reason why his company had 
so many NYS contracts. 
Wasn’t JUST cause he got lucky
Wasn’t JUST cause the dude worked his ass off back in 1992 doing installations for Key Bank,
Wasn’t JUST cause the dude knew how to tear apart a Lexmark printer with his eyes closed...
...and throw it back together. 
There were other components, such as [RAW TALENT]. 

Yeah I did my research before my interview in September 2010.

But, all of those guys have something ELSE in common, too.
If they get offended by something, they MAY hear it and just ignore it. 
Cause they heard that shit from a lot of people, they won’t ignore everybody.

It actually requires MORE EFFORT/ENERGY to respond to EVERY NEGATIVE thing, a person has to say.
Some of those things may slip through, but those instances appear to be rather RARE.

The problem is, sometimes people might not know the weight of their own words. 
So, the party they’re saying something negative about may take MORE offense to something that was casually 
stated in error, or they may not have known better.

So like, if DWAYNE COONRADT said “Fuck ELON MUSK, his fuckin’ TESLA company sucks ass, bro...”
ELON MUSK is NOT gonna give a flying fuck. Why...? DWAYNE will have to figure that one out.
I have no idea what DWAYNE thinks, but, I would immediately disagree. 

Cause, TESLA is the most profitable car company in the world right now. (I think)
They also make the fastest production car in the world. The TESLA MODEL S PLAID. 
Still waiting for Tesla to come out with the 2020 Tesla “Tire Roaster” Roadster but they could always update 
the model year, so, no big deal. 

The new Roadster is bound to kick the shit out of EVERYTHING...

But, if I spent a while, researching a report on how somebody did so well for an industry, and I happen to 
later insult them... then they will probably take that negative thing a lot more closely.

On the other hand, people with no inkling of RAW TALENT, they will actually use their reputation to slander 
people, which causes a lot of communication issues between people. Because they didn’t get where they were for
being “talented”. 

Guys like the people I researched that are in this report, aren’t really gonna need to worry about doing that.
But others that just so happened to find themselves floating around in the S&P 500 or some shit... that were
“DIPLOMATIC”, then they have to worry about someone’s personality kicking them out of whatever position they 
find themselves rising or falling to... that’s because RAW TALENT is the thing that industry leaders LOOK FOR, 
but the HR departments typically don’t know how to do that. So.

People who have a lot less talent, they will take action on basically every negative thing they hear.
(Like, Andrew Cuomo, for instance) Some people who aren’t nearly as skilled or have as much RAW TALENT, they 
will just ask buddies to abuse stuff. Like, exploits and cyberattacks, complicated stuff that they can throw 
a stack of cash at, like an advanced persistent threat. YEAH.

Wanna know how someone gets a really good job and makes a lot of money...?
When you know all the things I know, and then you find out who’s censoring you, and then break their fuckin’ 
fingers, all of em too (pretty sure that won’t be necessary). Cause nicely asking them to stop, doesn’t work. 

The identity thieves are probably the reason why I am in this predicament, but also... 
...some of my own peers that wish they had as much experience or talent as myself. | ← Braggadocious, however.

Being nice, is fine. Nothing wrong with mutual respect at all. And if I have apparently insulted the entire 
stack of people in the S&P 500, I really hope that they realize that I don’t actually think they got where 
they are for their ‘ass kissing skills’, alright...?
___________
| Dilemma |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
It’s a problem when people think you have to like, kiss somebody’s ass in order to get ahead in the business 
world. Cause, let’s look at it like this. Let’s say that I found out that DANIEL PICKETT had something to do 
with this shit. I don’t think he did (his brother might be a different story), but, SUPPOSE that were the...

...case. How would I be able to get myself out of the predicament...?
Well, I think that there are obviously (2) ways to do this.
___________
| 1st way | 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Somehow get his attention, whether that’s having a conversation with his daughter (telling her how 
hot she is), or casually stating things in documents and just distributing them where ever... and at some 
point, if this guy DOES decide to have a conversation, I’m gonna resolve my differences with the man. 

Because, being honest and forthright can actually do both sides some favors. 
I tried repeatedly over the years, to resolve differences with this company and this dude. 

And you know, if Matt Caldwell JUST SO HAPPENED to be around, ask him if he’s down for a game of pool,
or some shit. MAYBE, go fishing. Why not...?

But that probably doesn’t ALWAYS work, because people will remember: 
“Oh, the guy that said some WARRANTED shit to somebody?” 

Whether something is WARRANTED or not, a person’s REPUTATION is more important to SOCIETY...
...than whether they do extremely questionable shit.

They rarely ever (know/care) if that shit was WARRANTED, or not. 
If it WAS WARRANTED, “Oh well, man. Fuck you.”

I guess saying that someone with “raw talent” is a form of “ass kissing skills”, but at the same time...
...no it isn’t. 

Because I explain later in the document how/why some people deserve special recognition for their work, in: 
[Chapter 5 – If you were smart, you’d be rich by now]

Gates and Musk are two noteworthy entries that I also discuss alongside Warren Buffett, Mark Zuckerberg 
(to some extent), and Jeff Bezos. Everybody does something where if they make a mistake, it’s no less 
important than the things they did correctly.

Some industries change though. 
All of THEIR industries, change RAPIDLY.

At the same time, if you do something really well and deserve some recognition, then that’s important.
When someone tries to take that away, that will piss some people off to no end.

Here’s why: what if EVERYBODY put on their resume:  
      ____________________________________________________________________________________________________
      | swears a lot | fucks mad bitches | tells people to fuck off here and there | has a lot of talent |
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Well, who the hell would ACTUALLY see that resume, and be like: “I’m hirin’ THIS dude right here, man.” 

Some people will actually see some of that stuff written on a resume, and find it funny. 
Those are things people might deserve some recognition for.

Most people don’t know what humor is (or at least how to pick up on it if it’s subtle), so if they see it 
they’ll just be like “this dude’s gotta be fuckin’ kiddin’ me...” and that IS what they’re doing, but they 
never think... “Maybe this dude’s tryin’ to make me laugh...”

No PROFESSIONAL is going to put something like that on their resume, but- an EXPERT might.

That’s because society demands FORMALITIES and PERFECTION, even when the people themselves are far from it.
Exposing their mistakes is a pretty easy job, highlighting their accomplishments is a lot harder to do.

Regardless, it stands to reason that a person’s reputation may be as great as it is, BECAUSE they can do 
these things in the shadows... Nobody says “Oh, Elon Musk is the richest dude in the world cause he fucked 
mad bitches, swears a lot, told people to fuck off here and there, and had talent the whole time.”, even 
though, that is the truth. William Gates did that too. So did Buffett, and Bezos, and Zuckerberg. 

They’re not gonna TELL people, “yeah, I’ve sworn a lot, AND told people to fuck off here and there... also 
fucked mad bitches...” Cause, those aren’t FORMALITIES. Even if all of those things ARE TRUE... they’re not 
a FORMAL way of communicating what they’ve accomplished. Although, guys like Jay-Z or Marshall Mathers WILL.

Might even write a song about it, whether it’s:

“You havin’ girl problems I feel bad for you, son... I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain’t one.” -Jay-Z/Resume
“Bitch you can beat me with any spatula thatchya want, blow on your Bagpipes from Baghdad”  -Eminem/Resume
^ both songs have a theme called “bitches be lyin’ about somethin’...”

It’s not something I’d ever expect Warren Buffett to go around tellin’ people:

Awesome. Those are fuckin’ impressive accomplishments, aren’t they?                                       (← SARCASM)

What if Andrew Cuomo put those things on his resume...? They’re fuckin’ true as hell man.
Well, Cuomo might actually have gotten so pissed about that, that he asked a number of people to slander me, 
and might’ve even attempted to have me killed (I don’t know the last part) I’m not even exaggerating that at 
all, I believe it. However, the oil industry will do more than just slander somebody’s credibility... they’ll
actually have a guy killed. Yeah, sometimes they’ll ask someone at the FBI to do it for them.

So, then there’s a second option where Jeffrey Epstein hangs himself in a prison cell even though he 
was a billionaire. Dude had so much money, why did he hang himself...? Oh... cause he didn’t.  (← CLINTON BODY COUNT)

Someone was able to use a technique where I occasionally flaunt about how someone manages to do that to 
themselves, and that is what THEY did to him. In other words, someone wanted to make an example out of him.
I don’t really have enough details to determine whether the guy really deserved that or not. I know he wasn’t 
innocent.

As for Dan, I don’t think Dan is a bad guy after some of the clues I’ve seen. 
The fact that the clues happen as often as they do, tells me that. 
I really do not think Dan deserved a lot of things I said about him. But obviously someone else does.        (← JOHN)

Until PAVEL ZAICHENKO JR. had to start shorting me my wages, and had me driving my OWN fuckin’ car for ASURION, 
and IFIXURI, yeah... Me and one other dude putting `$15K into the company revenue stream. PAVEL would take `$12K
out of that check to use toward COMPANY PAYROLL, then keep `$2K for himself (so `$14K so far), and give me and 
CHRIS FLOESER `$500 each... The other `$12K PAVEL would also keep, on the books. The rest of it just went “missing”.

Now, the true number WAS higher than that, for me and Chris.
But, might as well say that THOSE WERE THE REAL NUMBERS.           (← WHICH IS PRETTY MORONIC CONSIDERING EVERYTHING)
Which would mean that Chris and I were actually LOSING money, to do the job. 
Yeah, Pavel is an idiot, he didn’t quite grasp the concept of how I used to get paid a LOT MORE THAN THAT...
...to deliver newspapers for the HEARST CORPORATION from (2006-2009)

It’s why I said: (`$200/day which would’ve covered so many of my expenses), and PAVEL agreed to DO that. 
He was supposed to pay the both of us, (`$200/day).                           (← STILL VERY WELL BELOW WHAT I’M WORTH)
AFTER he agreed to that, he wasn’t payin’ us anywhere REMOTELY CLOSE to that... because he would use the whole...
“the company just needs to get caught up dude, we need a couple of really good weeks, man.”

However, that is what someone who caresses many penises with his mouth, will say.
In other words, this dude is not a real “great guy” if I’ll be perfectly honest.

If anything, PAVEL is an actual SAUSAGE WRECKER. He’s got 2) skills.

    (1) collect lock-boxes at ALL of the stores that HE, HIMSELF, never does ANY work at...
    (2) (lying to people/wrecking sausages) in a 69 position with former Gov. ANDREW CUOMO, blowing each other.

I don’t think DWAYNE does that. He lies to people. He doesn’t do (1), nor does he do the 2nd half of (2).
Pavel sure as hell does, I think. It’s a fuckin’ free country. Imagine that, what if Pavel called Michael Zurlo, 
and he’s like...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Zaichenko : Dude, Mike Cook knows me and Cuomo suck each other’s dick, man...
Zurlo     : Oh really...?
Zaichenko : Yeh.
Zurlo     : That’s basically illegal.
Zaichenko : What, sucking each other’s dick, or him saying that’s what me and Cuomo do?
Zurlo     : Using the First Amendment of the Constitution... that’s basically illegal.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

It’s totally legal to call someone a sausage wrecker, even if you think a governor IS one, long before the 
sexual harassment allegations were brought into the public frame. And, that is exactly what I kept doing... 
“Cuomo’s a fuckin’ sausage wrecker alright.” | ← This dude, took offense to the many times I said it, too.

Here’s the thing. Even PAVEL ZAICHENKO JR. gets some pussy, alright. So... 

Even if he IS able to OCCASIONALLY be found in a 69 position with former governor ANDREW CUOMO...? 
He still has SOMETHING to hold over Cuomo’s head, such as “able to get some pussy, basically whenever”

So, PAVEL can’t even be CONSISTENTLY referred to as a SAUSAGE WRECKER, but rather an OCCASIONAL SAUSAGE WRECKER. 
Cause if he’s gonna say to himself one day:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Pavel : You know what...? 
        It’s time to wreck Cuomo’s fuckin’ sausage...
(...then, later that day...) 
        That was a... bad idea. 
        *shakes head* Time to get some pussy...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

...he could actually pull that off. 
I’ve SEEN this dude chase girls down, and they will talk to him and start flirting with him.
I’ve never once seen girls do that with Cuomo.

In fact, I can reference 11 times that women actually went to the police, and told the police that the governor 
was trying to get his candle waxed, and they didn’t want anything to do with that. I’ve never SEEN Pavel wreck
anybody’s sausage, and he’s always had a girlfriend, and he has a daughter. Look at Cuomo. I have seen Pavel get 
overly excited around me. Not being aware of someone elses’ personal space, is what caused me to believe that he 
might actually be bisexual. 

One way you can get an impression like that, is by detecting patterns. Seeing a dude with his hot girlfriend, 
and his daughter that looks a lot like him, is a great way to tell “Alright, obviously he fucks bitches.” 
At the same time, invading somebody’s personal space, or like... having one of your aides respond to me on 
Twitter “Seek help” after I fuckin’ insulted this douchebag... that tells me that maybe Cuomo doesn’t like the 
idea that even Eliot Spitzer gets bitches, man. 

Being oblivious to someone elses’ personal space, AND appearing to be overly excited COULD indicate that maybe a 
dude with a hot girlfriend AND a daughter, COULD be bisexual. He never like pinched my ass or whatever, nor like 
leaned in for a kiss or something. Cause that would be a dead giveaway, and I would fuck this dude up if he tried.

I am fine with GIRLS doing that, but- not some scruffy ass dude. 
Cause that’s gonna be grounds right there for me to tell other people, “That dude is definitely gay.”
I’m not gonna go around telling everybody that some girl and I fuckin’ got in each other’s personal space, and 
then got into a heated exchange where I ripped her pants off, turned her around, told her to get against the 
fuckin’ wall, and then just demolished her rear end... 

Obviously, the girl isn’t gonna act overly excited and get in my personal space if she’s not thinking about 
choking on a big fat D. And if I get in HER personal space, and she’s still overly excited, then you know right 
there and then, that there’s a really good chance that she wants to be fucked.

Cuomo, doesn’t understand that.
Now, suppose Andrew Cuomo WASN’T an actual sausage wrecker... 
Would 11 women accuse him of sexual harassment...? No, because they would’ve probably been cool with the idea of  
having sex with Andrew “Don’t touch me, grandpa” Cuomo.

Suppose that Pavel Zaichenko wasn’t an actual sausage wrecker either... would he owe me over `$4,000 in backed 
wages, or be investigated by the labor department at any point...? No.

Anyway, when the HIDDEN government has to use these SERIOUS EXPLOITS, to try and contain ME, being a 
fuckin’ dude at a computer shop, I start to think that maybe they’re fuckin’ jealous about SOMETHING.

These two guys, that I recorded on video, they’re prior customers of that business. 
They were talking about Kristina Czaikowski, who’s the sister of a guy I went to school with… his name is...
Chris Czaikowski. I... don’t ask me why they would name them both some form of “Chris” … but- hey, this girl
was as hot as the girl in the Judge Pelagalli story, WAY hot.

At one point. I got in an argument with her brother, and I didn’t want to get involved with the police or whatever, 
and he misunderstood what I said, I never once thought anything bad about this girl. She was... a lot more than 
just fuckin hot... not the hottest girl I’d ever seen in my entire life, but definitely enjoyable to look at and 
talk to. Anyway, the point is, these (2) dickheads know who SHE is, and SOMEONE could like, show me some fuckin’ 
MUGSHOTS or like, COLLECT THE PICTURES I TOOK, but mysteriously, some sausage wrecker runs SCSO. Yeah.

He doesn’t appreciate being called one... but he plays this same game that so many other people play where they… 
they fuckin’ heard what I had to say alright, but I never hear back. And that, to me, is OFFENSIVE.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(3,"Hidden Gov’t and Corruption",@"
Further to that point, requesting transcriptions from the court is bogus. 
Why do they do that, rather than the audio recording? 
See, something like that sounds incredibly questionable. 
It causes me to think that’s the type of stuff that the hidden government would not like to have repealed.

What the hell is the reason...?
There does not appear to be a good fuckin’ reason in my mind at all, as to why that law exists in the 
first place. Trump actually did have a solid strategy (← give credit when credit is due) as it related 
to eliminating laws that are complicated where there could be much more efficient laws in place, or like, 
eliminate 2 regulations to make 1. That’s a fuckin’ genius idea.

I really do think that the whole justice system is … in need of a “wipe and reload” 

When I ran Computer Answers, wiping and reloading meant CLEANING EVERYTHING and STARTING OVER.

Suppose we did that with legislation...? Ya know?
That would really fuckin piss off the hidden government I’m certain of it.

Because people will have all of these “body motions” where they go to do something, but that law doesn’t 
exist anymore, now they have to retrain their brain to do something a lot less complicated...

The other approach is to gather all court records throughout the state, and to classify how many people 
are being processed by each court and for what, and then aggregate all that data. Once it’s all in a system, 
start ripping some of the laws apart, top to bottom. Like, look at Family Court, half of the laws it operates
on are highly unconstitutional, why not just merge county courts with OCFS...? 

So like, Saratoga County Family Court, doesn’t need to be open anymore, right...? 
Just kick all of those people outta that building and start from scratch.
*wipe your hands clean* Good, took out a huge ring of corruption right there.

Cause, it’s not like they do anything there other than SPAM PEOPLE WITH THE WRONG TIMES ON THEIR COURT 
DATES, and then LIE TO THE PEOPLE THAT TRY TO GO TO THEIR OWN COURT APPEARANCES, and then APPOINT PUBLIC 
DEFENDERS THAT ARE TERRIBLE AT EMAILING/CALLING CLIENTS BACK... that sort of stuff. 
So, why have a Family Court at all... ya know...?

Even Sergeant J. Hildreth will say “I’ve seen WORSE cases, where the children stayed in the family.”

I believe that the other side of the coin, isn’t to eliminate the courts or laws, or the employees or 
whatever, but to determine how much of the system is corrupted. With Windows, you run a tool that runs 
an “integrity check”, and I don’t think they have that shit in real life.

Same thing needs to be developed for all of the people in the government, basically. 
Cause I don’t even really think it’s the PEOPLE so much as it is PEOPLE OPERATING ON THEIR PREDECESSORS 
WORK, and if some MISTAKES were “added in real quick”...? 
WELL, were they MISTAKES, or NON-MISTAKES...?

They’re gonna say that, but they don’t know if they were HANDED a corrupt system already. | ← PROBLEM
The thing is, I’m gonna make the ASSUMPTION, about Saratoga County Family Court...

Lets say I was an EXTREME case where they had to ACTUALLY work REALLY hard to ignore me.
In ALL of their opinions, they “protected my rights”.
In MY opinion, they’re fucking morons to say that, unless they used “air quotes” every time they said it.
That would actually make perfect sense.
And, it isn’t just an OPINION when it’s ALSO a FACT.

VIOLATING my rights – is NOT the same thing as PROTECTING my rights.
Nah, I don’t think Dennis Bruce understands what the word “PROTECTING” actually means.
His idea of “protecting my rights” means: Screwing up ALL the things they sent me, and etc.

What if they do that to everybody, and I’m no exception...?
First off, I fuckin’ highly doubt most people are as observant as I am.
But- even IF it was atypical, I’m pretty sure that the court system is still rather unconstitutional, 
AND, it forces itself to be like that because of (3) things,
(1): Corrupt politicians not actually getting prison sentences for committing felonies
(2): Corrupt police SELECTIVELY enforcing CERTAIN laws for SOME people, not ALL of em for EVERYBODY... 
(3): The system has to “adjust” itself to make up for the standard of living, 
     but doesn’t realize that if they … fuckin’	arrest the politicians that are taking bribes,
     or committing racketeering, then...? 
     They could like suddenly have `$500M outta of like, nowhere... 
     they could like share it with the people they didn’t need to do these fuckin’ sheisty things too...

I gotta consider that Dr. Loeber at Saratoga Hospital doesn’t actually know what medical fraud is...
I gotta consider that Laura Hughes at CPS doesn’t know what CPS fraud is...
I gotta consider that Judge Pelagalli doesn’t know what mail fraud is...
I gotta consider that Michael Zurlo doesn’t know what obstruction of justice is...

They may all be doin’ that shit, and have no fuckin’ idea that what they’re doin’ is worthy of compiling a militia
...so that they can be ARRESTED... 
...cause the police aren’t doin’ that.

I’m gonna convert ALL of the things I’ve said, into the notion that know they’re doing these things anyway. 
The only way to accomplish anything when considering this mentality, is to FORM A MILITIA.
Laws matter, and I’m not gonna put a whole lot of thought into having to escort all of these people to jail.
Because I have a feeling that, I just made a discovery I didn’t want to make. Which is that they:

$Book.AddSection(3,"Tyranny",@"
Tyranny appears to be in full swing, and there’s something wrong with this guy. (← CHARACTERIZATION)
An extremely useful tool, is to consider characterizing a problem as an actual person.

I’ll tell ya, Tyranny is a fuckin’ ugly motherfucker and he’s there, at all times. 
Riding on people’s fuckin’ negative energies and causing people emotional distress and pain...

It helps when people give a shit. 
The human condition is quite fucked, but I don’t think it’s a lost cause.
The problem is that I think people are doing illegal shit, knowing that people aren’t going to do anything 
about it. Not unless they’re ready to put their life at risk.

When I say “doing illegal shit”, I don’t mean the small petty shit like “stealing less than `$20 worth of stuff
from a store”, or like “buying illicit drugs”, because those are problems that may be problematic...
...but they are INDIRECTLY CAUSED by SERIOUS crimes being ignored. 

Most people aren’t ready to put their life at risk, and most people probably will think that this rhetoric 
is insanity, because once I start talking about the system doing illegal things, I’ll have to explain that 
maybe that’s the primary goal of the people I just listed. As many crimes as they can possibly commit. 
They haven’t come across anybody that was able to slap the cuffs around their wrists and arraign them.

So, if they know how to exploit people into thinking they’re taking your kids away for a GOOD reason, well, 
nah... wasn’t for a good reason at all. It was for a really BAD reason, cause they know that the Captain’s 
2 sons that live off of Farm to Market Road, aged 27-32, white approximately 6” tall, glasses... Oh man. 

They tried to kill me between (05/25/20 2343 → 05/26/20 0004) and then for a while after that. They are 
gonna try again, because I’m going to continue manipulating them into doing so.

       I could imagine if they had a nutsack, they could actually try to attack me AGAIN...
       ...cause if they succeeded, they could totally put in my dead pooper.

She’ll probably be entertained by all this... 
I’m glad that Kristen Johnson was so concerned about shovin’ a dildo up her fuckin’ asshole, and taking

Rather than for the kids to be around if that happened, best to provide them to somebody who’s gonna look the 
other way when serial killers come around. 

Suppose that’s the case, hidden government has these people that hunt citizens down, and if the people they send 
get killed, then whoa, that’s jail time cause they’re probably being watched... Basically, serial killers that 
nobody has any defense against. (Covered in [Chapter 6 - Hidden Government])

Sometimes people will USE THEIR REPUTATION, to cause people to make ASSUMPTIONS.

are not. I talk about that later on.

| Q : How can anybody define the term “Evil”...? |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Evil, is when you ask yourself hypothetical questions about “if this person did this, then what...?”...
...and as long as those questions involve those people, but OTHER people cannot be swapped in to make the 
same level of sense... that is a great way to define “evil”.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(4,"Identification",@"
So for instance... 
Condition 1: “IF Michael Zurlo facilitated an attempted murder by using Pegasus, 
...then can Captain Cooper’s (2) adult kids kill me...?”                            (← Not sure what their names are)

If someone is stupid enough to say “Yeah.”... switch the “people”, or “actions” around.

Condition 2: “IF Michael Cook facilitated an attempted murder by using the Constitution, 
then can A WELL TRAINED MILITIA kill Michael Zurlo AND Captain Cooper’s 2 adult kids?”

Well, if EITHER of those questions sound QUESTIONABLE already...?                            (← That is fuckin’ evil)
         ------                    --------------------------

If someone wants to ABUSE the Constitution, it becomes a LOT fuckin’ harder for someone to JUSTIFY doing 
something that was pegged as EVIL. The truth is, a compelling argument has to be made in this particular 
scenario, because people will try to say “There’s no way condition 1 is even a reality...”          (← FALLACY ALERT)
Another fallacy is “Too good to be true”                                                            (← FALLACY ALERT)

There is in fact a way after all, if it is EXTREMELY OBVIOUS, by their lack of cooperation or action. 
So having EVIDENCE, is a great way to PROVE that, and if they don’t allow any of their officers to COLLECT any, 
that means they are being provided an ORDER to do so. Which, that can be considered a CAPITAL OFFENSE.

Whatever the case may be, a compelling argument has to be considered PLAUSIBLE by other people. 
Typically, a MILITIA will already agree with the MILITIA LEADER, because that is WHY it is part of the 
Constitution, because the Brits did this shit too. “Oh, I don’t see the problem...”                  (← Yeah they do)

Sometimes, people with military training who have been embedded with “anti-interrogation techniques”, they 
know how to follow a protocol that was developed by people who’s job it is, is to kill people. 
If the core central focus of this document is about “legally killing people”, it stands to reason that I’m 
talking about it for a damn good reason. But- it’s gonna scare the shit out of some people when they read it, 
even people that AREN’T DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

But, they need to be EDUCATED, on how to determine with SHEER CERTAINTY, that these EVIL things become GOOD 
things, and vice versa. MORALITY and ETHICS play a HUGE role, in determining ONE from the OTHER.

$Book.AddSection(4,"Moral Dilemma",@"
Example: Moral Dilemma: Train track (Covered by Michael Stevens from Vsauce) 
You just so happen to see (5) people that are somehow tied to a set of train tracks.
You just so happen to see (1) person that is somehow tied to a parallel set of train tracks.

You ALSO see that a train is inbound... on those very tracks. NOW, you’re nervous... and your heart is racing, 
cause, who the hell would tie people to train tracks like that...? You know these people are in trouble...

CONVENIENTLY, you just so happen to ALSO see... there might be a way to switch the tracks and save some lives.

Nobody questions how this is possible, or how conveniently arranged these circumstances are.
Cause that’s how society operates... ANYWAY...

You have very little time... those (5) people’s lives can be spared/saved...
However, the other track JUST SO HAPPENS TO HAVE, (1) person tied to the tracks.  
You have the CHOICE, of NOT DOING ANYTHING, and those 
(5)         deaths remain  on your conscious for the rest of your life... 
    OR, you can DO SOMETHING, hit the switch, and prevent a net loss of (4) less people.
(1) persons death  remains on your conscious for the rest of your life...

Once you instantiate that above scenario, that means it is NO LONGER HYPOTHETICAL.
It is a METAPHOR, and doesn’t necessarily mean that a bunch of people are gonna get THEMSELVES tied to the 
fuckin’ train tracks, because it would be ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS to NOT consider how they got there to begin 
with. So the death of those people should NOT be on a particular person’s conscious, HOWEVER... people do 
that every fuckin’ day.

For instance, the hidden government causes Americans to suffer, and actually laughs about it too. 
 _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 | Hidden gov’t : Wow, LOL. Those fuckin’ 19 kids and 2 teachers, they deserved that shit in Uvalde, alright.  |
 |                We should really put an additional `$100M in Ted Cruz’s pocket so it happens more often.      |
 |                These Americans have NO FUCKIN CLUE that we laugh about this shit every god damn day.        |
 |                If they KNEW THAT WE EXISTED, they would probably exterminate us with extreme prejudice...   |
 |                See no evil, Speak no evil, Hear no evil.                                                    |

Probably sounds EVIL to hear all of that, right...? Well, police officers are OK with that. 
So are doctors. And the judges, and every lawyer, every politician, everyone is OK with this scenario 
occurring right under everyone’s noses.

Nah. (^ Meant to be highly manipulative) 
That probably sounds fuckin’ ridiculous. Nobody will openly state that they’re OK with that shit at all.
But, it is actually a real thing that needs to be taken SERIOUSLY.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(4,"Determining Seriousness",@"
Sometimes these people aren’t afraid at all, they’re deadly and have actually killed people before.
The more people they are involved with killing, the more “dead” the look in their eyes becomes, when they lie.

Some people have no conscious at all, because they’ve conditioned their conscious to “Shut the fuck up, dude.”
Military, specifically has this. Not everyone that joins the military, can pull it off.

Many veterans often kill themselves, because when they make it back into society, something is “off”.
This never goes away, either... They remember the scenes of their buddies being blown up, just like in...
___________________________________________________________________________________
| The Hurt Locker | Jeremy Renner | https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hurt_Locker |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
(^ One of the best fuckin’ movies ever made)

The movie apparently perturbed many veterans that were actually over in Afghanistan/Iraq, because it was 
not consistently accurate, however- I can’t think of a MORE compelling movie, as to what the fuck actually 
happened over there.

Maybe American Sniper could be more realistic, but it wasn’t as well received. Still a good movie...

There are trade-offs when making a movie that is (historically/specifically) accurate, AND interesting.

Regardless, the idea or theme here, is... Once you’ve seen people getting blown up, shot to death, or 
eviscerated by shrapnel, or even... one of the most disturbing things about “The Hurt Locker”, is the 
scene where the dude is just standing there, and then “poof” then his buddy turns around and he’s like 
“...dude, where’d ya go...?”

Oh. It’s because he fuckin’ basically got vaporized, in like *checks watch* less than a second.
Once some people see shit like that, then they may eventually tell their conscious: “Shut the fuck up, dude.”
Cause I’m sure it’s a deafening voice.

Regardless, this doesn’t necessarily make these people EVIL either... 
But- people should consider that some people really are that damaged, scarred, or emotionally numb...
...and they make perfect soldiers, military contractors, police officers... and members of a militia.
So it makes perfect sense to understand their motivations and relate to them.

Look, she was not the only person that had this particular conversation with a guy like Craig Apple, 
I have no doubt that Apple is probably a good law man. 

But, I have a serious issue being able to apply that to OTHER county sheriffs. 

In order to deal with acclimation of the SEVERITY of a given situation...
...as well as allocation of SUSPICION

You won’t likely talk about stuff like this IF the SEVERITY isn’t HIGH ENOUGH. 
Because, something has to be PRETTY SEVERE to get as involved as I did in developing this entry.

SEVERITY can be determined by a SINGLE incident, or it can actually be a PATTERN or MULTIPLE incidents.
--------                        ---------------                          -----------------------------

Patterns can effectively determine severity pretty easily, that’s why SERIAL KILLERS always follow a PATTERN.

...05/25/20 2343 → 05/26/20 0004 outside of COMPUTER ANSWERS @ 1602 Route 9, CLIFTON PARK, NY 12065.

If I’m going to unpack, discuss, or examine this, to convey my THEORY, and it’s associated PLAUSIBILITY...
...it stands to reason that I have to make a PRETTY FUCKIN’ COMPELLING ARGUMENT.

Because, MICHAEL ZURLO wasn’t the only person involved in something like that... No way this dude was flying 
across the county at the speed of Goku, being in 10 places at once, and somehow being asleep in his bed at home 
near (New Country/Falcon Trace). Known or suspected associates ranking in likelihood or possibility.

This LIST above, means that ALL of these people, are SUSPECTS. (***** Indicates HIGHEST LEVEL, or RED HERRING)
That does NOT mean that they are GUILTY, could mean that they are INNOCENT and the REASON WHY they’re INNOCENT
explains how SOMEONE ELSE IS GUILTY.

Pretty substantial. I can say with SHEER CERTAINTY, that PAUL ZURLO, is a gay guy, but he is not a 
bloodthirsty killer at all. I can ALSO say that about TIMOTHY BERLIN, not GAY, but innocent.
Same goes for ANTHONY AGRESTA, not GAY, but innocent.

As I go down that whole list, I can say either GAY or NOT GAY, and INNOCENT, or GUILTY
By using (2) properties like sexuality and intent, I can convey to OTHER people, what they may agree with.

Like, most people will agree, PAUL ZURLO, he’s gay. But, doesn’t really make sense that he’s a 
cold-hearted killer. TIMOTHY BERLIN, not gay, hard to believe he would be a cold-hearted killer.
ERIC CATRICALA, probably not gay, probably NOT a killer, but could be PLAUSIBLE with specific context.

BRUCE TANSKI, pretty sure he’s not gay, probably NOT a killer either, he is ASSOCIATED with someone who 
DEFINITELY is. JOHN HOFFMAN, stays low key, probably not a killer himself, but is associated with someone 
who is.

CENTER FOR SECURITY, deadly → Pretty sure they crack safes and locks, to perform home invasions.

This is a lot like determining someone’s PERSONALITY, there are a lot of fuckin’ properties and variables 
to consider. Most people suck ass at deriving intent from someone’s personality. Like, JEFF BROWN, an 
investigator at SCSO, as well as SHELLEY ZEITSKE... I was able to determine by interacting with them 
(1) time, that [they’re not very good at what they do*].                         (← I MAY HAVE CAUGHT THEM OFF GUARD)

Doesn’t mean that they fuckin’ did anything remotely as bad as someone else...? 
But- if they wanted to “win me over”, they failed to do so. When I write these documents and make them longer,
and longer... someone that’s an intelligent bastard is gonna read ALL of it, and agree with me, that I’m not 
someone that should be underestimated- I have made a SERIES of compelling arguments.

Are they ALL correct or accurate...? Maybe not. However, some people will be impressed by the thorough nature
of this entire story. Some people might even say “OoOoOhhHh he was wrong about (1) thing in the BILLION things
he talked about, and THAT MEANS, totally wrong, fuckface. Oh well. Ya almost got me. Time to throw ya in jail...” 
-MICHAEL ZURLO

...then when I’m stuck in jail, I’ll be thinking to myself “Damn. If I had just swapped (1) of those words 
around, might not be in jail forever. Oh well. What can anybody do?”  (← people who wrote the Constitution knew this)

That sounds like a joke, because it is. However, a lot of people have been victimized in this fashion.
The truth is often stranger than fiction.

The truth is that even the police make mistakes, like writing the incorrect address on an incident report.
Sometimes that is done INTENTIONALLY, and it just APPEARS to be a mistake.
Other times, it is a LEGITIMATE MISTAKE, and you can derive if it was a mistake by repeated exposure, or like,
someone may show signs of dyslexia or some shit. 4184 or 4148, they may remember the NUMBERS, but the ORDER, 
might be off slightly. Or 1763 Route 9, versus 1769 Route 9... which one is Business Products Company,
and which one is Zackary Karel’s residence that used to be a doctors office...?

These strategies probably sound pretty easy to understand to everybody, however... uh, douchebags will use 
them as a means of “throwing their tail”. Like in the movies or on TV,

           ...nobody followed me HERE... 
Main Guy : *sigh* There could be microphones here somewhere, ya never know.
Spy      : OH REALLY...?

I may have pegged SOME of those people on the list as PLAUSIBLE at a point in time, 
(I.E. Agresta, at or about July 14th, 2020)

When I talk to people, I’m not just listening to WORDS, but also ^ those elements. 
I ALSO consider previous OBSERVATIONS I’ve already made, and PARALLEL OBSERVATIONS I am currently making.

In other words, I’m multitasking like a motherfucker when I talk to people. 
I don’t have a photographic memory, which fuckin’ sucks.

If I did, I could scroll around and say: 
“Kid had glasses, backpack, and a tattoo on his left bicep that looked like <drawing>...”

| “What the fuck was that last part, dude...?”                                                              |

| [You can substitute ANYTHING ELSE that is supposed to EVOKE a response*]                                  |
| So, if someone responds: “What the fuck was that last part, dude...?”                                     |
| THAT means, they heard ya and they’re payin’ attention after all.                                         |
| If that happens, apologize, and say JUST CHECKIN’...                                                      | 
| The reason why you have to CHECK people, is to determine if they’re being ABSENT-MINDED                   | 
| In some cases though, you’ll determine whether that person is (SUGGESTIBLE/NOT-OFFENDED)                  |
|___________________________________________________________________________________________________________|
| FALSE AFFIRMATIONS/NODDING/SMILING, NOT TAKING NOTES, MIRRORING... usually indicates ABSENT-MINDEDNESS    |

| Responses like: UH-HUH. COOL. AWESOME. GREAT. I HEAR YA BRO. HEY, IT IS WHAT IT IS. WHAT CAN ANYBODY DO?  |
| Those indicate a “yes man”, using ONLY these responses typically means they’re not registering (1) word.  |
| So, throwing an occasional “then, suck my dick I guess...”, and they say “HEY, IT IS WHAT IT IS MAN...”   |
| (^ What the fuck do you think that means...?)                                                             |

I have not collected records from the NEW YORK STATE POLICE for a KEY REASON.
I do not suspect the NEW YORK STATE POLICE of attempting to murder me on May 26th, 2020, and that is DIRECTLY 
BECAUSE, of Shaemus Leavey, and the (2) girl cops that spoke to him on 05/26/20 near Stonecrest/Werner.
Shaemus Leavey knows that the video existed on my device, I showed him a portion of it, the very next morning.

I know SOMEONE IN THE NYSP is compromised, it’s not: Leavey, O’Neil, Rizzano, Dickson, Ennist, Borden, 
nor Carter... NONE of them were involved in the MURDER ATTEMPT.
BORDEN did cover shit up, and asked questions about CATRICALA and the pictures I took.

NYSP TROOPER/INVESTIGATOR ROBERT MESSINES… as well as his SON DEPUTY/TROOPER MESSINES, who was reported
as a STATE TROOPER in THIS TICKET 2020-040845, who just so happened to show up at the EXACT same time…
…as ANTHONY AGRESTA, and PAUL ZURLO. Wanna know why…? It’s because he was IN HIS COUNTY SHERIFF UNIFORM.

Being reported as a STATE TROOPER when you are in fact working as a SARATOGA COUNTY DEPUTY…
…SHOULD BE A HEINOUS CAPITAL OFFENSE. Because then you could just FLIP-FLOP between being a Sheriff ONE 
second, and then the next…? Now you’re a State Trooper. What if the FBI could do that between one minute
being an FBI investigator, and the next minute, now they’re a fuckin’ judge. Ah man. That is why this 
MISREPORTED INCIDENT, 2020-040845, needs someone with a lot of power/authority, to SCRUTINIZE THE LOCAL
POLICE FOR CONSISTENTLY BEING CARELESS.

So, they’re prime fuckin’ suspects, alright.
In addition to TROOPER RUFFAS, as well as SERGEANT BOSCO, and even… Sara DeRusso. 
Who made an UNLAWFUL and UNCONSTITUTIONAL ARREST on 06/28/22 when I informed them that I had an AUDIO RECORDING,
Of the ENTIRE INTERACTION, between MYSELF, and my MOTHER… and the AUDIO RECORDING DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS THE STATEMENT
that my MOTHER, FABIENNE S. COOK MADE, to the POLICE, which is a FELONY. That’s right. 
KNOWINGLY PROVIDING FALSE TESTIMONY TO A POLICE OFFICER ON A WRITTEN INSTRUMENT IS AN ACT OF PERJURY.

Then, ERIC CATRICALA attempted to kill me a couple days later on FATHERS DAY in 2020.
Yeah, that dude was driving the white SUV, I’ll discuss that in: 
[Chapter 7 : USA-Patriot Act of 2001 and Surveillance Capitalism]

$Book.AddSection(4,"Resistance",@"
Pretty easy to tell when someone WAS, however. When someone IS involved in something like that, they will act...
...like a dog that just shit in the house, and then you try to put their nose in the shit pile. 

The dog knows it shit there... It doesn’t wanna look at it... “I know I shit there dude... c’mon...”
There will be RESISTANCE, so when people OR (officers of the law) fully COOPERATE and are openly discussing 
things, then I can DERIVE INTENT from that conversation... Joshua Welch, is someone at SCSO that has good 
intentions each time I’ve spoken with him, he has told me the TRUTH, and it’s pretty easy to tell by their
RESPONSES... that they can be trusted.

Sometimes it is the TIMING of the DELIVERY of their RESPONSES, that indicate that they can be TRUSTED.
So, long dramatic pauses COULD be them knowing they heard ya... and they’re tryin’ to be slick, and pretend...
...like they didn’t hear a comment at the tail end of a description like I described above...
...if they don’t even REGISTER that they heard that...? 
...that can mean MULTIPLE things.

If it’s some girl that hasn’t SAID ANYTHING, she may actually be thinking about it... that’s why she’s silent.
...might’ve gotten her pants all wet. Now you’re an asshole if you don’t let her do it... but then again... 
...if she doesn’t say anything, and like, doesn’t act on it, then what the hell is she mad about...?

If it’s some guy, same thing, but- don’t tease em cause then they’ll be like “Oooh, but you said...”
That’s why it is actually HELPFUL, to know whether someone IS a SAUSAGE WRECKER after all.

As far as I know, JOSHUA WELCH, JEFFREY KAPLAN, MICHAEL WHITEACRE, MARK SHEEHAN, and ANTHONY AGRESTA... 
...none of them have made any indication whatsoever, that they’re SAUSAGE WRECKERS like (PRINCE/ANDREW/CUOMO)…
...and they have ALL made it VERY CLEAR to ME, that they can be TRUSTED.
...but just cause PAUL ZURLO is a SAUSAGE WRECKER, doesn’t mean he can’t be TRUSTED | He can still be trusted

However, whether THEY know, or they don’t... someone at SCSO pulled some funny business, and tried to get me 
killed. And, they might even work with a bunch of queers that have blown PRINCE/ANDREW/CUOMO at some point.
Or other dudes.

The listed parties above in the ZURLO/Association list, are NOT New York State Troopers, are they? Nope.

SCSO was definitely involved in trying to kill me, I wouldn’t suspect it if I didn’t see so many indications
or FEEL like SCOTT SCHELLING was trying to do that. Yeah. Dude was TRYING TO DO THAT, which is why I asked 
JEFFREY KAPLAN to follow him when bringing me to my house. JOSHUA WELCH and JEFFREY KAPLAN arrived MINUTES after
SCHELLING did.

Typically being the FIRST OFFICER TO THE SCENE, wouldn’t tell me much unless there were additional observations.
SCHELLING was actually a somewhat reasonable guy at first, he made no indication that he was trying to hurt me. 

In fact, I thought that JEFF KAPLAN was quite a dickhead. However, SCHELLING asked for my ID. First time in my 
life, where a police officer was like “OooOoOohhhHh, let me see your ID.” and then I handed it to em, and that 
dude didn’t need to run it at all. Never went back into his vehicle to run the ID. 

He knew who I was based on a PRIOR INTERACTION (SCSO-2020-027797) the night Niskayuna PD MARRA WALTER drove me 
home. That ticket number, has an EXTREMELY DIFFERENT NUMBER than ANY OTHER RECORD, MOST of the incidents start 
with (2) 0’s. That PARTICULAR record starts with only (1) 0. Something seems VERY SHADY about that.

After SCHELLING saw my ID, he didn’t need to run it, and KAPLAN like asked him, “How come you’re not runnin’ 
his ID...?” Well, SCHELLING said “This is the guy that walked to Stratton the other night.”  
So, apparently the entire roster of SCSO heard about me. 

AT THAT EXACT MOMENT, the roles between these (2) guys (← Reversed/Switched →)
...so SCHELLING went from COOL cop, to DICKHEAD, and KAPLAN went from DICKHEAD, to COOL cop.

I don’t typically say “HEY, THAT DUDE’S A DICKHEAD COP, ALRIGHT....”
Nah. I am typically very cooperative and I don’t try to cause or stir trouble.
However, something was bothering me and I already had a prior incident with ANTHONY AGRESTA and how am I going 
to be able to let the guys in SCSO know “Hey. I think somebody’s trying to kill me...”

Observations I made beforehand and SINCE then, reveal all of the details to ME very clearly.
Plus, it’s helpful when an actual New York State Trooper like Shaemus Leavey, fuckin’ sees the existence 
of a piece of evidence I had (the video I recorded that night outside Catricala Funeral home).

Because, even if AFTER that, someone using PEGASUS DISABLES my iPhone 8+ which had that VIDEO on it...? 
Trooper Leavey KNOWS I’m not bullshitting anybody, that video existed. And, I know he had nothing to do with 
locking me out of the device OR the evidence, because I had many interactions with him afterward. 

However, I DID think he had something to do with my device being disabled, until he and another trooper spoke 
to me at Fred the Butcher | 07/05/2020 @ 1400 ← this interaction and their NONVERBALS sorta told me everything.

He knows I was disturbed by SOMETHING, I can tell that dude is TRUSTWORTHY by many other interactions I had,
but I actually walked to the FBI field office May 27th 2020 because I was NOT SURE.
5 minutes after I showed Trooper Leavey the video, MY PHONE WAS DISABLED

Before Trooper Leavey saw the video...? Not disabled. 
After  Trooper Leavey saw the video...? Not disabled.
            5 minutes after he left...? Disabled, screen TOTALLY BLACK, still powered on, I had to pull the battery.
After I powered it back on, “THE DEVICE IS DISABLED, FUCK YOU BRO, NO COOL SHIT WAS ON IT ANYWAY, HAHAHA.”

(3) factors here that tell me - someone compromised their equipment.
    1) 3x Audio uploaded BEFORE attack, 1x file named “Capital Digitronics”, all 3 uploaded at ~11:30ish 5/25/20
       from Computer Answers wireless network that I configured back in 2018
    2) Cars for “Capital Digitronics” coincidental spots, like at 203D Halfmoon Heights, and Dr. Len/Cohoes.
    3) Scott Schelling asked about the files I uploaded.

I told Trooper Carter this way back in December 2020, BEFORE I ever spoke to Mr. McCabe. 
Trooper Carter → “I don’t really fuckin’ care about anything you say man, really, I don’t. 
Schelling is a good guy.
I trust HIM over YOU... you might’ve handed him the device, but he’s a good guy.” ← NOT verbatim. 
Carter was not involved at all, he just TRUSTS that dude. I can tell that Carter doesn’t fuckin’ like me. 
But, I can say with total certainty that he literally had nothing to do with the event, by the way he’s talked to me.

Same way that I know Carter had no involvement, is how I know Mr. McCabe had no involvement. 
Either THAT, or fuckin’ he … didn’t know I was a target or something. 
But I doubt it, reason being... I recorded the conversation I had with him. 
The impression was that this dude was actually cool as fuck, and I saw the kid that lives across the street 
from me with a puzzled/concerned look on his face when he came outside. 

One of the 3x AUDIO FILES I uploaded to my Google Drive account from the WiFi network at 
Computer Answers 05/25/20 ~2330, is SPECIFICALLY named “Capital Digitronics”. 
Those files were uploaded about 20 minutes BEFORE I saw the FIRST kid who just so happens to be a 
SERIAL KILLER. In one of those recordings, I remember someone was trying to hit me with their vehicle 
ON THE WAY TO MOBIL. I sorta forgot about it. But, I uploaded the audio recordings and then heard something 
in the woods behind Catricala’s building (the “bird”).

Prior to this, I walked around the building behind the Catricala Funeral Home, and took some pictures.
Then I walked back out to Route 9, and attempted to record a video, but forgot it was still on picture mode.

Then I switched it to video mode, and I just continued to talk, eventually, the kid walks up to me. 
This “kid” is a “SERIAL KILLER”. One that attacked Computer Answers BEFORE. Like on January 15th, 2019.
Then, I recorded the VIDEO that I showed Trooper Leavey.

Also, my neighbors that live across the street from me ...they work for Capital Digitronics. 
Coincidence...? Coincidences do happen. But not as often as I have seen them.
When I spoke to Mr. McCabe, he appeared to have NO idea who I was. So, I think he is TOTALLY innocent.

Facebook post # 1: [Class Action Lawsuit vs Spectrum/Charter Communications, Verizon Communications, and more...]

I have evidence of these companies working together to prevent fair competition. Verizon, is formerly known 
as Bell Atlantic. The phone company known as Bell, has faced multiple class action lawsuits throughout history.
It was split up resultant to the first lawsuit Bell faced.

Unfortunately, when you have stupid, lazy, or ignorant people in the government that can confuse a cruise 
missile for an airplane... then they will ALSO confuse Bell Atlantic for Verizon and AT&T... cause they’re 
both the same company too. Competition is like this... you buy a burger from Burger King or McDonalds... 
...they source their own “everything”...

Not the case when you have Spectrum, you’re paying for Spectrum to use Verizon’s fiber optic network...
...it’s the same network that its wireless branch uses, to extort people into paying (2) separate bills:
                     __________________________________________________________________
                     | 1) for cell phone service | 2) for landline home/business etc. |
                     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Spectrum hikes up the rates too, in the town of Selkirk, you can receive [Verizon FIOS 1GB US/DS] for:
- `$150 a month which includes home phone and cable

The reason THAT service is not available here, is because some people need to be [BANKRUPTED] by lawsuit 
that can’t fail. Because, you might think `$500B is way too much of a targeted amount of monetary relinquishment
capability, but I have news for you. 

That’s chump change, I may have to crank it up even higher than that.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Spectrum : We can avoid this for as long as possible but we will fail. 
           Because...? 
           Bell Atlantic will repeatedly face ADDITIONAL class action lawsuits again, and again, and again... 
           And when they change the name again, from Bell Atlantic to Verizon...? 
           ...then the defendants in the case should be referred to as Bell Atlantic for the 3rd time...
           AKA, Verizon Communications.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Yeah. You can change the name of the company, you can also pretend like the communications companies aren’t one 
big massive company that lies to everyone... But what you can’t do, is prevent me from forcing your company to 
go bankrupt resultant of this lawsuit. 

Why? Because cornering the market is something that only drug dealers should do... not internet service 
providers or telecommunications providers. Also, you won’t be paying the fines from this lawsuit with free 
HBO, not this time...

You’ll be shut down permanently because ALL of YOUR revenue was taken, ASSETS got frozen, and then the people
that COOPERATED in AIDING and ABETTING a RICO, THOSE people have THEIR assets frozen, and THEY ALSO go to prison,
where everybody gets ASS RAPED, and then gets FORCED to suck some dude’s DICK. 
Some people actually LIKE that idea, like (JOHN PICKETT, BRUCE TANSKI, JOHN HOFFMAN).

Some people that should’ve went to prison finally made their way there, in addition to the judges that assisted 
you this whole time (like LESTER WORMUTH, and maybe ROBERT RYBAK)... and the POLICE OFFICERS that also assisted 
you this whole time... (like MICHAEL ZURLO, JAMES LEONARD, COOPER)

Spectrum: `$500B is actually enough to bankrupt us immediately. 

Which is my goal. It wouldn’t be if I could go to the Verizon FIOS website *right now*, and order FIOS from 
Verizon, and tell SPECTRUM to: “SUCK A FUCKIN’ DICK, BRO.”

But the reason that can’t or won’t happen is this simple... They have to be forced to do so by a HIGHER court 
order that can only be provided when I make the program that showcases a live example of the justice system 
and law enforcement system working directly with these companies to assist them in [AVOIDING LAW FOLLOWING*].

Another term for this is called: Racketeering, (and/or) extortion. THOSE are illegal for EVERYONE to do.
Except... the USA-Patriot Act of 2001 takes the edge off of having to do the [FOLLOWING OF LAWS*] for certain 
people, which is why I seek to also relinquish its existence, OR, have the fucking thing AMENDED.

Because it allows RACKETEERING and EXTORTION to be PERFECTLY LEGAL… 
…until of course, people actually see LIVE EXAMPLES of it happening.

...via the program I am building that will override whatever a corrupt judge would say.
Because that corrupt judge would be shown talking to someone from these companies, planning a way to secure 
their money. maybe they just MAIL EACH OTHER INSTRUCTIONS, and they never have to SAY any of this shit at all.

In the same manner as (Rybak/Wormuth) in Clifton Park, NY.
THEN... the law will be totally fucking useless to these people that depend on its existence...

[AVOIDING LAW FOLLOWING*], when the government has a job that it sucks ass at, but somehow they continue 
to have the job, because they’ve sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth...
...and then they immediately lie RIGHT AFTER MAKING THAT OATH. (← What some of them actually do)

However, someone like me, sees the game being played. 
I think everyone should have access to landline+mobile, same service, but just created by someone a lot smarter.
So, you only have (1) bill to pay for BOTH. Verizon and Spectrum don’t want you to build infrastructure that 
takes their revenue away...

Offering the best that they both have to offer for a lot less money...? Such as `$10 a month...?
For your 10GB fiber optic connection...? AND, your global tethering which will still have your phone number...?
Offering something a lot FASTER and BETTER than the most premiere companies out there...? 
For... a LOT less money...?

THEY DON’T LIKE THAT IDEA... but THAT’S JUST TOO FUCKIN’ BAD, ISN’T IT...? 
It is. Too bad. Time to cry like a little bitch. -Spectrum/Verizon

It is NOT competition, when a company SAYS it is competitive, however, it still provides this pathetic service 
to people and does the same thing to the connection that Mr. Gates did with CP/M... 

Or what JESSE PICKETT did to my father MICHAEL E. COOK in 1988-1989

...slap your name on it, call it a fuckin’ day. (← I later explain why that happened)

In the case of (Kildall/Digital Research/CP-M) → (Gates-Allen/Microsoft/Q-DOS,86-DOS,MS-DOS)... 
Kildall was a little careless with his work, and was living a rather lavish, indifferent lifestyle.

Gates called Kildall for help, because he was looking out for the best interest of Microsoft, for the IBM deal.
They didn’t COPY+PASTE the original code, they did something ELSE. (I’m not going to elaborate on that)

As for Jesse Pickett, I really don’t know if he STOLE MY FATHER’S COMMODORE 64 DISKS FROM HIS CAR...?
But- I vaguely remember my father talking about that when I was a child.

Return from tangent... As for Spectrum/Verizon, they’re basically cooperating in a way where they look
nearly identical to (2) grown ass men in a full-on 100% 69 position, making choking/gagging/slurping noises. 
Basically exactly like SEAN HANNITY sucking on RUPERT MURDOCKS dick. 

Descriptive isn’t it...? 
That’s Spectrum/Verizon for ya.

That’s exactly why Verizon will more than likely require another corporate monopoly splitting...
The problem is, I have to finish building this program, because... they can have any judge do the same exact 
thing that they forced Spectrum to do, which was a pathetic slap on the wrist...

Because, whatever judge was involved in the class action lawsuit that was already placed against 
Spectrum/Charter for false advertisement of service speeds...? That judge shouldn’t be a JUDGE. 

Because paying off a class action lawsuit for a `$15M fine is just a slap on the wrist. 
You’re likely to look nearly IDENTICAL, to a woman with a huge penis in her mouth... 
...by providing a punishment like that. (← gay looking)

I intend to raise the stakes to a much higher amount. And I have to finish building this case against 
Verizon and the NYS government, because they’re working TOGETHER to commit RACKETEERING and EXTORTION.
Just a large, harmonious interchange of bodily fluids and internet connectivity.

That’s why Spectrum was able to walk away with paying the last fine with free HBO for customers... 
...rather than to provide a refund for services that weren’t received by customers...

Because when I threaten to wage a `$500B lawsuit against these companies, it will bankrupt them when I 
have enough evidence (shown above) to override the sentencing of any judge that has been proven to assist 
Verizon and Spectrum build this corporate monopoly over the internet backbone in this state.

So, THEN you won’t even be able to go to this website anymore and see that FIOS isn’t offered in my town... 
...even when I have pictures of the Verizon branding on the fiber optic cables all around town.

That is a monopoly. 
That is a Sherman Anti-Trust act of 1890, fully legitimate, PERFECT, golden deluxe exhibition, 
...showcase example, of CORPORATE and GOVERNMENT EXTORTION.

It should be ILLEGAL, for JUDGES to PRETEND like they’re not involved in this... (like Judge Paul Pelagalli)
...and I intend to have THEODORE ROOSEVELT show you how fucking stupid it is, to do that.

End of Facebook Post # 1. 

Obviously, that is not VERBATIM to the post I originally posted, as I’ve added the “bits” and “pieces”, that
I didn’t quite have on hand at the time... However, uh, during the rest of this thing I’d like to refer to as
[Chapter 5 – The “Week”], I had to do this thing where I made a bunch of queers that get paid a lot of money,
look like the lazy comestain dick riding queers that they are.

The problem is MUCH WORSE than I originally anticipated, basically there’s like (5) CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS that
need to be filed and compiled at the same time so that Kerberos, the hound of hades, the METAPHOR (not the 
actual network authentication protocol), the cut-one-head-off-a-hydra-two-more-grow-back mentality, has to
effectively bankrupt MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS, and PEOPLE, at the same exact time. APPLE is one of them.

Facebook post # 2 : Spectrum/Verizon, pictures... 

I’m sure that someone thinks I’m just kidding around about this `$500B class action lawsuit that I intend to 
file, here are pictures which illustrate my reasoning and ONLY A MINOR PORTION of the evidence vault I have 
been collecting of these two organizations working directly with Nfrastructure, as well as the LAW ENFORCEMENT
SYSTEM for the state, as well as the JUSTICE SYSTEM for the state. (Nfrastructure is too low level, not a high 
priority really. They’re involved, but it’d be like me trying to pin DJ THOMPSON with facilitation of murder,
instead of MICHAEL ZURLO.)

Because, that is what the PRISM program protects, and allows to be a thing.
So when the last judge provisioned Spectrum with a ‘weak-dicked slap on the wrist...’ AKA, a `$15M fine that 
was paid for with free HBO..? I intend to exponentially increase the likelihood of these companies just going
bankrupt INSTEAD (A great way to do this, is to manipulate these serial killers into attacking me again, and
they sure as hell will.). Which, will mean that the last judge can not be involved in this, because, they were 
paid to reduce the sentence to include the possibility of free HBO.

Not sure about anyone else, but it sounds like there is some MUTUAL penis (stroking/sucking) going on between 
all of the judges that could just shoot any class action lawsuit down and call it free HBO.

I intend to prohibit that from being a possibility. 
Because the judge can’t have any involvement with Spectrum, or Verizon, nor receive bribery to go with such a 
light sentencing, that, maybe all class action lawsuits should be able to be paid with Free HBO instead of you 
know, bankruptcy or prison...
Restricting fair competition, it is the same thing as extortion. 
It is why Theodore Roosevelt had to tell people...
"Walk softly, but carry a big god damn stick."

He probably said it so many times, that Rockefeller shit his pants every single time.
Then people will take you seriously.

Facebook Post # 3 : “Theodore Roosevelt”
Theodore Roosevelt was the 26th President of the United States of America. When I was in middle school, I
learned a lot about this awesome son of a bitch, and the presidential terms in which he served. He was the 
type of president, that physically went places and performed this thing called “actual hard labor”. This man 
literally used his bare hands, and helped build the Panama Canal, because ships spent a lot more time having 
to go all the way around the southern tip of South America in order for goods to make it to other places in
the Pacific or Indian oceans.

Theodore Roosevelt was one of the greatest Presidents that has ever lived, the man kicked ass, and took names.
Probably thought Benjamin Franklin was an awesome son of a bitch, too.
Probably went everywhere he could think to go, with his safari hat and monocle.
That’s just cause it was his “look”. Tough son of a bitch, didn’t even need the monocle...

I don’t see George W. Bush touching that type of legacy. Anyway, no known modern presidents actually perform 
physical hard labor, nor do they care what information is true or false anymore, unfortunately. (← on the fence)

Teddy Roosevelt played a pivotal role in the establishment of the food and drug administration.

Prior to that, Upton Sinclaire’s “The Jungle”, painted a real vivid picture of what type of cocksuckerisms 
would/could occur when people can just do whatever the fuck they feel like...
...sort of in the exact same fucking way as internet service providers, the FCC relinquishment of Internet
Neutrality, and… a bunch of data analytics companies that can help generate ISP’s additional revenue off of 
the data that their customers provide them for free. (← Ohhhhhhh, maybe THAT’S the point I’ve been making~!)

We could highly benefit from a [Theodore Roosevelt v2], where a president could provide this thing called:
A universally accepted definition of an outstanding fucking job. (← things changed over the last couple years)

However, that wouldn’t be acceptable to the people that are currently in control… who are fucking terrible 
at controlling anything. Such as: Finances… `$24T of national debt (2 years later it is `$30T) is a dead 
indication that your government sucks at managing finances. 

It SHOULD be legal to break people’s fingers when they EMBEZZLE taxpayer money, and then they use this money 
they EMBEZZLED to build UTILITIES such as CELL TOWERS with TAXPAYER MONEY, but then only PRIVATE COMPANIES 
have LEGAL ACCESS to those UTILITIES, and they can EXTORT anyone for WHATEVER AMOUNT of MONEY they feel like
CHARGING. (Like, stealing Nikola Tesla’s intellectual property, like A/C and wireless radio)

Theodore Roosevelt was the type of president who thought:
“that should be grounds to fire a lot of incompetent fuck faced individuals”. 
Which is why he went around carrying this big ass stick, because… asking people nicely...? 
Well… it could be ignored.

However, when you have a very dangerous looking stick… 
...and you have a pretty mean look in your eye like Teddy did… 
Then, the cocksuckers have no choice but to do what the fuck they’re told.

Now look… this word <unspecified>… it’s a derogatory term, and I shouldn’t use it so loosely to describe the 
<unspecified> that happens to be going on in terms of what fuck faced individuals get to 
‘pick and choose when to enforce the law’ or 
‘when to ignore the criminal activity you can do as often as you fucking please’… 
...in the same manner that 1) Verizon, 2) Spectrum, 3) the FBI, and 4) Nfrastructure… do.

Here’s the thing… I’m sure that by now, Judge Wormuth is getting sick of being called a cocksucker, so… 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

L. Wormuth : Look Mr. Cook, I don’t particularly take too kindly to being called a cocksucker… 
             ...because I’m not.
Me         : I really don’t care, dude.
L. Wormuth : While I AM a gay guy, and I DO accept bribery money from these companies that you’ve suggested…? 
             I don’t suck dick. 
             I make Judge Robert Rybek do that… sometimes I put it in his butt, but whatever. 
             I just wanted to clarify, there are gay guys out there that don’t actually suck dick. 
             Like me.
Me         : Well, OK Mr. Wormuth. 
             I won’t call you a cocksucker anymore...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

But anyway, can’t expect the judge to be THAT honest.

Theodore Roosevelt was the type of president that wouldn’t hesitate to take a hatchet to the thickest cable 
that you see in the picture here that is next to the highway. 

That is a major internet backbone in which all of this areas internet connectivity flows through... 

Which means that if Mr. Roosevelt felt like coming back from the dead real quick, to take a hatchet to that 
fucking thing, and then went back to his coffin to go back to sleep...? 
Well, then a great deal of people would be looking at some 404 errors... 
On any web page they went to. 

Because, when you take out the VERIZON FIBER OPTIC CABLES... then what happens is that Spectrum has to fix 
the problem or else all of their customers abandon ship.

Let’s say that Theodore Roosevelt wanted to end a corporate monopoly that exists and is showcased in these 
series of pictures... 

I’m fairly certain that the highway you see here would have to be shut down, so that they can install ANOTHER 
fiber optic backbone cable that would cost in the hemisphere of "a lot of fucking money..."... because the way
it works is, fiber optics aren’t just a ‘plug and play’ type of thing. 

The equipment that relays the transmissions is quite expensive... and so is the cable.
But when they made that investment many, many years ago, and then they failed to upgrade the speed 
capabilities for the consumers...? They cornered the fucking market on “available bandwidth”.
Like, in nearly an IDENTICAL WAY to: (PABLO ESCOBAR/COLUMBIAN DRUG CARTEL) → (MIDDLE MEN/AMERICAN DRUG DEALERS).

Well, it allows some douchebags to sit around collecting residual checks for cornering the market like a 
drug dealer would. Which is why Theodore Roosevelt REALLY wants to climb out of his grave, take a hatchet to 
THIS fucking thing whereby chopping it in half, saying “what a bunch of morons”, gracefully climbing back 
into his coffin, and then going back to sleep. (← What a REAL patriot, would do)

Help me prevent Theodore Roosevelt from coming back from the dead.
I can’t do it alone... and he can only be reasoned with when people give a shit about what’s fair.

Which, the people that stand to generate the most revenue off of this line NOT being cut...? 
They don’t care about things such as what’s fair, or what is true or false.
They should care...? 

Because, people like me are going to show up and prove to everybody what a lazy cocksucker you are... 
And then when I officially prove that these lazy cocksuckers get to extort everybody...? THEN, they won’t 
have anymore business to worry about... cause they’ll be suckin’ on some dude’s dick in prison.

End Facebook Post # 4.

Sometimes, SOME of the people that watch me 24/7...? 
They don’t realize how fuckin’ moronic they are, nor that they made a big mistake by closing my word editor.

So, then I have to carefully re-examine everything I did the day PRIOR, because closing the word editor will 
eliminate many of the changes I had made in a prior version of the document. 
They did this on June 20th, 2020 at about 530AM, after I had a dream about how William Gates had 
Michael Philipsak take a picture of me back in 1995/1996, and then after a bunch of years went by, he decided 
to let the cat out of the bag, and say that I was his brother. 

THEN, I might actually VERBALIZE those words WHILE I AM SLEEPING... and then THAT is when the people listening
24/7 realize, I’m sleeping. So at that point they think: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Idiots : OK, this dude is NOT William Gates’ brother. 
         If he JUST SAID THAT...? 
         Then, that means he’s sleeping, so... 
         Let’s go ahead, and close the application. 
         He won’t fuckin’ notice what we’re doin’.
         When he wakes up...?
         Oh boy, HE’LL be fuckin’ pissed alright.
         *chuckles* Heh. 
         You wanna fuckin’ poke fun at President Bush...?
         Oh, we’ll fuckin’ ruin your whole day, buddy...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Then they’ll leave certain aspects of what I was working on, OPEN... like, NOTEPAD. 
The word program closed itself, but the fuckin NOTEPAD program didn’t close...?
Huh. Seems like something a real lazy cocksucker from Nfrastructure might’ve done~! Weird. 

They don’t realize that while I may not have a photographic memory...? 

I still remember the main components of what I wrote the day before. So... the subtle little tricks that used 
to work don’t really work anymore. They should know this, but they have to try their damndest to throw me off
course, because someone like MARK ZUCKERBERG would make such an OBVIOUS mistake.

I’ve decided to include this audio log that I recorded on 05/19/20, because there are a number of things written
in it that are actually VERY PERTINENT to what I’ve discussed so far in this material, AND...? 

I was pretty pissed off when I recorded that audio recording up above.
I openly admit that I may have gone the full mile in insulting:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
| the government | the Department of Homeland Security | a lot of other people that deserve to be insulted |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
But, those people probably have a lot less to worry about, compared to George W. Bush... 
...because it might actually be true that George Bush Sr. thought that his son was a fuckin’ dumbass before
he died in his bed on November 30, 2018. So I imagine that his LAST MOMENT IN LIFE went like this... 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

GHWB : *faint* George...
GWB  : Yeah, dad...?
GHWB : *faint* Come here...
       Gotta tell ya somethin’.
GWB  : *approaches his father* What’s up dad...?
GHWB : *faint* You really are... 
       *gasping, faint* ...the biggest disappointment...
       *gasping, faint* ...in my entire life.
GWB  : *puzzled look on his face*
GWHB : *faint* You really are... 
       *gasping, faint* gonna go down in history...
       *gasping, faint* ...as the WORST fuckin’ president, in history.
       *gasping, faint* Unless of course someone WORSE comes along...
       *gasping, faint* ...THEN, you won’t be.
       *gasping, faint* But until THEN...?
       *gasping, faint* You really are a stupid son of a bitch, George...
       *flatlines*

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

The truth is, that guy was already in the oval office. Donald Trump. 
Worst president in the history of the United States. George W. Bush should be thankful...
...that at least I recognize that. 
Still comes right in 2nd fuckin’ place. Easily.

The rest of the people I’d insulted in that recording...? Some of them deserve an apology... 
Some people in the government did nothing wrong to be thrown into a category full of lazy, incompetent people,
and Chuck Schumer is one of them. Dude’s like a role model example for how politicians should strive to be, or 
act like.

Regardless, I spend quite a bit of time making audio logs. This particular audio log, I recorded when I was 
pretty heated. While I don’t outright recommend staying in this frame of mind on a constant basis, it is 
still productive at times, in moderation. Because it is ALSO just as unhealthy/non-productive, to keep these 
emotions bottled up and never expressed.

Thinking along these lines is what causes someone to think a lot like, or become... a leader.

While it is true that these audio recordings/logs can be supplemented by talking to a DOCTOR, or getting some
COUNSELING or THERAPY...? Chances are that these recordings are MORE helpful, than talking with THEM. Why...?
Because they typically do not have enough time to talk about all of these things, and then you’ll have to pick
back up where ya left off and then re-explain a number of details which gets to be pretty fucking annoying and 
wasteful with time, considering that any GOOD doctor or counselor will charge a nominal fee to appear more 
genuinely concerned... whereas the individual will have PLENTY of time.

In other words, making audio logs and recording one’s own thought process or rhetoric, is helpful. 
Sometimes I will spend several days in a row doing this. Each time I am done making these recordings, I will
immediately listen to them. Walking around making these recordings is difficult to do without being DISTRACTED, 
and if I get DISTRACTRED, then I will often fail to return to a prior point that I had made... so I gotta listen
to the recording again and then write stuff down, like BULLET POINTS.

But sometimes those distractions are HELPFUL. Why...? 
Well, if I walk around, and record these audio logs... and the SAME SUBJECT pops up enough times...? 
Then, I will actually sit down, and chisel out a DOCUMENT that covers ALL of those subjects.
Though, it would be pretty RARE, for someone to draft an outline that spans about 500+ pages...
...such as this book. 

However, I’ve done this over and over enough times to be able to teach OTHER people, how do to it too. 
Doing this will help ANYONE to be more AUDACIOUS, or WILLING to discuss subjects that the normal every day 
person may find too difficult to talk about. 

Repeatedly exposing yourself to this, develops strength in a similar manner to how Arnold Shwarzenegger 
became the strongest body builder in the world. The guys that used to win every body builder competition...? 
They thought they were the best there ever could be. 
Then one day, an actual tough guy from Austria came along by the name of Arnold Shwarzenegger.

He saw what the “strongest men in the world” had to show off, then he had to show the best in the world: 
“How a REAL man, lifts weights”. 

Most people might think “Arnold doesn’t have a mean bone in his body...” but they don’t understand...
This dude didn’t JUST smoke his competition... Nah, he did a lot more than that.

He made them look absolutely ridiculous, WHILE talking mad shit to them.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Arnold : Look guys, what you really wanna do...?
         Is not curl the dumb bell like a whiny little bitch.
         See how I’m doin’ it...? 
         THAT’S how a REAL man, curls some fuckin’ dumb bells, dude.
Them   : *getting more and more pissed off as they watch, unable to stop watching*
         How the fuck are you even able to lift that much with one arm...?
Arnold : Oh, well, I’m literally showin’ ya how to do it...
         
\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

He went around talkin’ mad shit to every one of them, started making ALL of the toughest guys in the world, 
look like whiny little bitches. Day in...? Day out...? Making the strongest men in the world look like a 
line full of menstruating teenage girls. Seriously, that’s the synopsis for the documentary “Pumping Iron”.

Apply the same concept to ME being the newcomer, walking into a room full of psychiatrists, that all have
a doctorate in psychology or psychiatry, and then I show up, and then I start diving into topics that they
don’t know how to unpack or examine... I’m gonna catch some cocksucker like RICHARD TODD LOEBER, who might
actually suck at being a doctor.... and he’ll misdiagnose someone who’s naturally a lot more intelligent,
AND a lot better at psychiatry, than his ass will ever be because of it.

The resistance that society develops is because people don’t know how to talk about something UNLESS other 
people are doing it. Then society sorta shapes itself to draw these ridiculous lines about whats ‘allowable’ 
or ‘not allowable’. That’s not because the subject isn’t necessarily worth talking about, but rather, the 
subject may be too EMBARASSING, UNIMPORTANT, UNINTERESTING, or not COOL enough... but those are all OPINIONS.

That means that those topics are always subject to change at a moment’s notice.
The reason why they may have those DESCRIPTIONS associated to them, is mainly because most people suck ass 
at knowing how to do this on their own. MOST people gauge whether something is worthy of discussion, based 
on how OTHER people will respond to it.

If you do this enough times, you’ll be able to focus on or further develop arguments or points of discussion 
in reference to things that matter the most to YOU. So, if it happens to be a subject that few people are 
daring enough to talk about...? Then, that means it becomes a stigma. Then, nobody talks about it... it just 
becomes an ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. 

That can happen for multiple reasons, but typically it means that most people CANNOT, or WILL NOT, think of 
their own original thoughts NOR further develop their own ideas, or be more CREATIVE.

Sometimes, to make the story a bit more entertaining...? 
You just have to take a page out of the book written by Arnold fuckin’ Shwarzenegger himself...
There’s really nothing like getting inside of your opponents head, doing what THEY do, while ALSO talking shit.

Because, every story revolves around a conflict. 
Typically that conflict involves: PROTAGONIST vs ANTAGONIST.

But, sometimes you gotta get a little more (creative/descriptive) about the characters in that (story/conflict).

Sometimes you might find yourself getting involved in a story about the somewhat-slightly-jaded PROTAGONIST,
getting into a heated exchange with the not-all-too-concerned ANTAGONIST. Sometimes you might even hear bits 
and pieces about the 3-days-a-week good guy, in a constant state of battle, against the 4-days-a-week bad guy.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Person : ...I’m actually rather interested in hearing how this story would play out...
Me     : What story...?
Person : The story about the 3-days-a-week good guy, versus-
Me     : the 4-days-a-week bad guy...?
Person : Yeah.
Me     : Oh.
         Alright.
         Well, the 3-days-a-week good guy and the 4-days-a-week bad guy are basically the same guy...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
       
The point is, sometimes the conflict revolves around the CHOICES that people make. Breaking Bad is a perfect 
example of how a character goes from being the “good guy” to the fuckin’ “bad guy”. The problem is that most 
people who watch the show, they stick up for Walter White well past the end of the show. Even the creator 
himself, Vince Gilligan thinks:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Gilligan : I just, do not quite understand it.
           I created the character...?
           He’s a BAD dude...?
           But- people still root for him anyway.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

The truth is that Breaking Bad earned itself a LONG FUCKING LIST of AWARDS because it focused on a relatively
SIMPLE IDEA...? And expanded upon it, over and over until they had themselves a pretty obnoxiously good series.

Then again, Vince Gilligan worked on the show X-Files back in the day, and had some sidekicks like 
Moira Walley-Beckett, and even Gale Ann Hurd, who was involved in the original 1984 Terminator movie with 
James Cameron AND Arnold Shwarzenegger. So... you have a whole entire football team of people that know what
they’re doing... and they decided to write up a show about a high school chemistry teacher who got fucked over 
by his best friend, going on to earning themselves a Nobel Peace Prize, and being a billion-dollar company.

So... the point I’m trying to make is that “Big things start small.” -Jeff Bezos

I’m not going to write about everything I posted to Facebook, but I had been recording some videos of birds.
Back in February or March of 2020, I recorded a video of what I believed was a Peregrine falcon.

Then, on 05/21/20 at approximately 2:45PM, I recorded multiple videos of multiple TURKEY VULTURES flying above
ASTOIA VUCETICS’ property. After posting the videos on Facebook, a friend of mine (Kris Wacikowski) told me 
that they are TURKEY VULTURES, and they feed on CARRION. In other words, dead bodies... 

Now, maybe it’d be a bit of a stretch to say “Ah, dead bodies must be nearby.” after seeing (1) TURKEY VULTURE.
But I literally recorded a video where there are (6) of them circling AT or ABOUT, 15 Fern Lane/ASTOIA VUCETICS
property... THEN, as I was writing up these last couple of paragraphs, it appears as if WRITING THESE LAST 
COUPLE PARAGRAPHS REALLY PISSED SOMEBODY OFF either at FACEBOOK, or like, LOCALLY... because I had to REFRESH
THE PAGE, and somehow a couple of posts I wrote on Facebook that day...? Man, it’s like somebody didn’t want 
me to find something out in particular from that day.

Now, I can’t get an exact fix on the creation time/date for these videos, but the LAST one I recorded after
going to the Microsoft website and saw a bunch of flying orbs comin’ at me. The TIME is visible WITHIN that 
particular video. So, by itself...? It might seem TRIVIAL. However, when I take the things I posted on THAT
particular day...? (Jim Keller/AMD/GlobalFoundries), Zen, (Bryan Kryzanich/Intel Meltdown/Spectre), Hillary 
Clinton, James Comey, Julien Assange... hm. I gotta say, I talk about a lot of things, but I am able to see 
VERY CLEARLY, that I’m pretty sure I pissed off Jeff Bezos…

Maybe I don’t know the weight of my own words sometimes, but I really do feel as if Amazon has historically
done a great job. But there’s a guy that kept stepping on Elon Musk’s toes at every corner, trying to one 
up this dude who was already knee deep in shit with the other car companies run by morons like Bob Lutz.

Maybe I hurt this dude’s feelings, and I should apologize to him for having a company that sends a lot of 
defective products to people. OR, tries to sell the idea of an Amazon Snowball, which will clone all of a 
particular company or client’s data, and THAT means that several tractor trailers worth of storage databases
get to show up... rather than to use a bunch of techniques that COMPACT the total size of that large storage
pool of data... 

Basically what I’m saying is that maybe, in some cases, to get ahead in life, society, or America...?
You literally have to SPAM THE SHIT OUT OF PEOPLE... with shit that doesn’t work, is defective, or wastes
a lot of energy, time, or money... because, why the hell not...?

That’s not ALWAYS the case however.
Look at Bob Lutz, the former director of General Motors, who ran a company for 50 years.
Everyone thought: “Jesus Christ, Bob, you really do make the best cars money can buy, don’t ya...?”
But then Bob woke up, cause nobody ever fuckin’ said that. 
Nah, I’ll rip on Bob Lutz later, cause Elon Musk did a splendid job of “showing us mortals how to run a 
car company.”

You can capitalize on really BRILLIANT ideas like Elon Musk has... but, obviously that’s just a lot fuckin’ 
harder to do. Anyway, I don’t want to focus on Jeff Bezos being like a kid in a candy shop, but he acts like
one quite often. He’s done the world a number of favors, but when Amazon literally started shipping BRAND 
NEW LAPTOPS with BAD HARD DRIVES IN THEM... 

I had these conversations with the customers: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Customer : Yeah, I just bought this laptop from Amazon.
Me       : Oh yeah...? That’s cool.
Customer : Why is it acting so SLOW...?
Me       : Ohhhhh... well it’s cause the owner of Amazon wants to build rockets...
           ...instead of selling his customers computers that have good hard drives in them.
Customer : What does that mean...?
Me       : It means that Amazon sells a lot of defective products, and doesn’t give a shit about it either.
Customer : Wow. 
           I can’t believe that AMAZON would ship me a BRAND NEW LAPTOP with a BAD HARD DRIVE IN IT...
Me       : Well, believe it man.
           This is like the 100th time I’ve seen this.
           That is... fucking HIGHLY impressive...
           Right...?
Customer : Well, no. It’s not all that impressive at all...
Me       : Ah. 
           Well, Jeff Bezos wants to build a company that makes rockets that aren’t anywhere remotely
           as COOL, as SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets. 
           So...
Customer : ...so that’s why I got a brand new laptop shipped to me with a bad hard drive in it...?
Me       : Basically, yeah.
           Look, you can tell them to replace the hard drive, but I can go ahead and sell you the 
           performance and protection package.
Customer : Oh really...?
           Just what the hell is THAT...?
Me       : Oh, well, it’s where you get a deluxe package of a solid state hard drive, warrantied for 3 years,
           if it fails in that period of time...? Bring it back and you get a replacement free of charge.
           It’s got PERFORMANCE, cause it’s a LOT FASTER than a regular hard drive... and PROTECTION because
           its got the warranty, AND comes with an installation of Windows 10, and then...? 
           Whatever I can retrieve from your old hard drive, basically the data transfer is included.
Customer : Now, THAT sounds like a HELL of a deal...
Me       : Hey man...That’s what I’m here for.

In the audio recording I had recorded earlier that day, I spoke about a dream that I had about the PowerShell
console. I talk about a wide range of subjects related to application development and my experience with 
technology.

- next version of Windows
- penetration testing obsolete
- penetration sealing
- engineering back doors
- graphics driver flashes black, disengages, and then reengages (basically this is what PEGASUS does to a device)
- application development laundry list 
- building a processor requires like, at LEAST 5K employees (Or, [1] badass like Jim Keller)
- many other things that I’m gonna leave out, or talk about in a separate book

| [0001]: I took this picture by ‘accident’, but I don’t think it was accidental anymore. This was taken  |
| a couple minutes BEFORE I recorded the sound of the bird, below. There’s no way that I didn’t hear the  |

| At some point I heard the sound of this “bird”, didn’t sound natural, hence the recording.              |
| Audio recording I made near Snyder’s (pretty sure that’s not a natural bird, 05/21/20 2359)             |

On my way back, I saw a guy walking down 146 with a red flashing thing and kinda scared the shit out of me, 
cause it gave me the impression that I should follow him and head to Schenectady, not sure why.

| [0001, 0002]: Guy walking down Route 146 toward Schenectady. This gave me a bad feeling. What might be  |

I kept walking home, and I could hear the bird going off behind the building across from Snyder’s.
This thing LITERALLY sounded like a bunch of different car alarms were going off. Like, when I was a kid
they had these little guns that had a sound effect and each time you shot the gun, it would change to a 
different sound. That’s basically what this thing was doing. Didn’t sound like any bird I’d ever heard in 
my entire life.

I began to take a closer inspection, when suddenly 1 Sheriff coming off of Fire Road, turned left at the
intersection. No fuckin’ sense cause there’s a shortcut to go that other way where Peddlers is, avoids the
light. I was standing there, right in front of the old county courthouse, and this dude either didn’t see 
me at all, or just fuckin’, didn’t give a shit. 

This happened with a 2x more units actually, same exact behavior. (AKA “PATTERN”)
Then, after ALL (3) of those guys did the same thing, the BLUE TRUCK drove right past me, following them...

The OBSERVATION here, doesn’t necessarily mean any of them SAW me, but it feels rather DUBIOUS that none of 
them did. I then got closer to the sound of this bird coming from BEHIND the fence. Had an unshakable 
suspicion that it might’ve had something to do with the book I left for this girl, though I’m not sure HOW.

I’ve completely forgotten about the book and what happens in it, but I do remember little hints. 
It’s a book about a kid named Andrew, a dude, and some woman, and the dude/woman bang it out... beyond that?
I really don’t remember.

They were on some type of journey but really I have a pretty big issue with remembering something 
like “a whole book” that I read maybe 20 years ago. 

I think a bird, I think there’s something else representative of Cortana in it. Not the game Halo Cortana 
or the Microsoft voice assistance Cortana, but the actual spirit or guardian angel, Cortana. The book was 
about some gypsie type stuff. Some lady from O’Connell and Aronowitz recommended it. 

She knew something about my grandmother that kinda seemed too good to be true, but it was accurate.
I was working at my uncle Thomas A. Cook’s deli (Cook’s Deli @ 46 State Street, Albany NY), and then my 
grandparents came in to eat the very next day. It wasn’t typical for them to come in, all that often.

I had a feeling that someone kept an eye on me that whole fuckin’ time, cause they tried to kill me many, 
many times earlier in life. *I don’t know that for certain though*. I just know somebody’s been watching me 
since... like fuckin’ 2002. Maybe not intently, not daily, but I had a hunch that somebody who USED to watch 
me cause they were afraid of me, started watchin’ me again. 

Felt like the fuckin’ evil spirit of Shenendehowa, the [queer/English Assassin] that killed many American 
colonists, otherwise known as the “boogeyman”. I had a premonition of this son of a bitch when I experienced 
my first panic attack, when I was in the woods with my friend Sean Tumsuden near Koda/High School West, across 
the street from the entrance near the (orchestra room/auditorium). Same side as the transportation/bus lot. 

Basically, a PREMONITION is (although a SPIRITUAL term) effectively having a DREAM or a VISION. 
They’re real alright, ALL people have them when they feel like someone is watching them.

I almost went into the fenced in area behind the old county courthouse across from Snyder’s, (trees were ALL 
still there) luckily I didn’t because it was making the same noises that are in the recording I later recorded 
at College Park Hall “DANGER, DANGER”, as the blue truck drove by. 

Pretty sure that this “bird” is NOT a bird. (link to the evidence listed below)
Although, I believe it is a weapon (a deadly one that someone has been using)... I believe it is ALSO a tool.

The reason why it felt like it was trying to protect me, is because I know that when something feels too good to
be true, it’s also too evil to be false. The Uncanny Valley is basically what kept me alive. I had this feeling 
that someone I knew was calling out to me. Not really sure how else to put it into words, but it felt EXTREMELY 
FAMILIAR, and felt like it was reading my thoughts. I had a suspicion that this thing was trying to tell me where
to find some dead bodies, like, unintentionally leading me to them.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Bird : Hey buddy, it’s almost your 35th birthday...
       Come check out this spot where someone else has already been killed.
Me   : Nah, I’m all set.
       Thanks though.
Bird : C’mon dude, come closer. 
       You KNOW you wanna figure out what the hell I am...
Me   : *chuckles* You’re probably a hell spawn or the ghost of somebody who’s been killed already.
Bird : Maybe I am. 
       Maybe I’m not. 
       Could be WAY cooler than that bro...
Me   : Well, something doesn’t really feel right to me though.
Bird : Dude. 
       Don’t be a douchebag. 
       Lots of COOL people to hang out with, in here.
Me   : ...really?
Bird : Yeah dude, totally.
Me   : Like who...?
Bird : *shakes head* Only one way to find out, dude...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Like, people that have already been murdered and disposed of, basically. 
I didn’t really know that at the time...
Just so we’re clear, I still don’t KNOW that, either. It is simply a SUSPICION/THEORY.
Honestly I think this thing might’ve been from the 4th dimension. Cause it felt like it was from the future.
Then again, I don’t really wanna go with that as a definite, because there may be another explanation.

It’s a good thing I didn’t see the gate at all, cause I would’ve went in there. And, I am absolutely certain 
that someone WAS watching, and waiting for me to do that. I am absolutely certain that HAD I done so, I would 
have been killed and then went missing THAT night. (Which, strangely enough, is what I had recorded in the 
audio log earlier that day...)

I’ve had visions of that, too. Where had I gone into the fenced in area, being stuck like a caged animal, and 
then getting arrested and thrown in jail, or simply stabbed to death.

I went into the stone quarry and sat in one of the stone piles, cause I would often do that. 
I laid there for about 10-15 minutes listening to this thing going off. 
It made no fuckin’ sense to me that this thing HAD to have been going off for like *checks watch* like a couple 
hours almost, and nobody was like “HEY THIS THING IS MAD LOUD AND I CAN’T SLEEP DUDE, WTF.” (← NOBODY did that)

Didn’t stop me from recording additional audio that seemed a lot less relevant, but it consisted of this bird. 
I had a feeling that it might be an (enemy/killer) piloting a weapon that sounds SO INTERSTING, that people are
compelled to get closer. I believe it may be a weapon that China or Russia developed if it isn’t US based, OR... 
dare I say it, alien based drones. I will explain why I believe that later.                   (← it is probably that)

I began to study the audio recordings I had. I thought they were interesting but knew that there was no way 
in hell anyone was gonna give a shit or take me seriously without some context, or <something>.

I started walking behind Cheryl’s Lodge and almost walked into the woods as I normally would have, and I 
heard a very strange noise in the woods that felt fuckin’ threatening. The sound of the bird was INTERSETING 
and COOL, but- this OTHER thing sounded like:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Sound : Hey- You better... *shaking fist at me* 
        Stay the fuck away from HERE, buddy... 
        ...or else.
Me    : *pause* ...alright.
Sound : You’re not even gonna say “or else what...?”
Me    : *pause* ...nah.
Sound : Well, good...
        I probably sound like I’m real threatening or somethin’, don’t I?
Me    : *pause* ...yeah.
Sound : Well, I could be something dying in the woods, but you’ll never really know, will ya?
Me    : *pause* ...no.
Sound : Alright buddy.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I don’t really know what it was, it could’ve been something dying in the woods, but I’ve never heard anything 
like it. It was dying for quite some time. Like, 5 minutes at least, I stood there and literally was able to...

...determine that it was (moving/walking) down the path in the wooded area that starts near the tire swing at 
the top of Cokey’s Canyon, and heads to the rear of Hoffman’s water treatment buildings/area. 

If I had a PISTOL, LOADED with the CORRECT AMMUNITION, SAFETY OFF, READY TO FIRE AT A THREAT...?  
I would’ve definitely checked it out. Unfortunately, I had no pistol on hand, I’m afraid...

It was coming from a portion of the woods where I would often walk through. I don’t scare easily, if ever. 
So, for a sound in the woods to cause a fuckin’ grown ass man to stop and not wanna get any closer...?

...well, it did cause me to think it was very dangerous and worth going to a military base because of the 
recording I made, AND that. Cause I actually started to think I was in a fuckin’ Hunger Games event or 
something... not exaggerating. I knew damn well how ridiculous I would’ve sounded calling the police and 
saying that, but I wasn’t on drugs or anything. 

Applying some common sense, it might’ve been a deer or something other animal like a wild fox... idk. 
It didn’t sound SMALL at all, it sounded like a (COUGAR/MOUNTAIN LION).          (← best characterization I can make)
I used to go there and record myself memorizing “The Uncanny Valley”, a poem I wrote.

    | Pretty sure it wasn’t Ken’s uncle who lives adjacent to this property and ALSO has a white SUV.       |
    | (It was ERIC CATRICALA, but I wouldn’t know that until MUCH LATER)                                    |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | I was closest to the food shack under the wooden deck, and this White SUV was headed straight for the |
    | garage... SO, that is how I know someone was watching my GPS tracker on my device with NO SERVICE.    |                                                            
    | Which, scared the shit out of me. (← This is AFTER 12x incidents with the BLUE TRUCK stalking me)     |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | Now, should I have been on the property...? No, it’s not mine. However, not only was I not damaging   |
    | shit, I was looking for CLUES because this dude just went MISSING. Nobody leaves a property in that   |
    | condition, unless they had a pretty good reason to say:                                               |
    |                                                                                                       |        
    | Astoia : Fuck it.                                                                                     | 
    |          None of that shit even mattered to me, anyway.                                               | 
    |          I only owned this property for like 35 years...                                              | 
    |          So, who gives a shit...?                                                                     | 
    |                                                                                                       |
    | I wasn’t damaging anything, BUT, other people definitely fucking were. I was trying to clean the      |
    | garage up, because it’s been trashed. Could be a nice, sellable or usable property, if the people who | 
    | OWNED it, gave a shit about it. After that happened, I have been terrified of going back there.       |
    | It isn’t the first time that I’ve seen people come onto the property, either.                         |

    | | I witnessed 3x vehicles drive up to the garage, and the kids driving those vehicles said that the | |
    | | OWNER of the property said they could just go on the property and do whatever. Can’t remember if  | |
    | | this was in October or November 2020.                                                             | |
    | |                                                                                                   | |
    | | They came onto the property, and trashed the place, and took a bunch of wood and raw materials    | |
    | | laying around, smashing every pane of glass or window they could. Now, I’m pretty sure the people | |
    | | who own the property didn’t say “Go ahead and do THAT shit.”                                      | |
    | |                                                                                                   | |
    | | But I noticed that whoever abandoned the property ALLOWED people to go in this dude’s house, and  | |
    | | smash up the Sheetrock and tear shit out of the walls, smashing glass and whatever, I had a       | |
    | | feeling that Astoia was probably a victim, UP UNTIL, the house, food shack, & wooden deck were    | |
    | | demolished. THEN people were actually taking care of the property.                                | |

    | Days afterward, or perhaps the following month, I walked by this area and somebody had gone into the  |
    | food shack and left the door WIDE OPEN. I was walking by, and I saw a dude and his wife, in like a    |
    | convertible looking at me, and the dude driving the car looked a lot like Eric Catricala, and he was  |
    | shaking his head with disapproval or something. So, I had a feeling that dude knew I was going onto   |
    | the property, but I didn’t leave that fuckin’ door open. Someone else did.                            |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | Just so I make myself clear, [I have lived adjacent to this property for *checks watch* 35 years*].   |
    | I don’t randomly think it’s a good idea to go scanning (someone’s property/the scene) for clues.      |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | I found a substantial amount of clues in every building, that led me to believe the man was killed.   |
    | However, SHAEMUS LEAVEY told me he is fine, and I WAS skeptical of that for some time until 07/05/20. |

At some point AFTER this happened, I started walking to Schenectady, and whoa. Holy shit. 
There’s a fence that looks like somebody got mad pissed about the sound I heard, and maybe they just IDK.
Somebody drove into that fuckin’ fence AFTER I left.  (← someone with telemetry footprint went where I did)

ALMOST LIKE IT WOULD’VE GOTTEN ME KILLED, to go in there, so, it’s a good thing I did NOT do that.
Cause I’d probably have gotten killed. No longer able to live. Met a condition where I WAS alive, but then,
I experienced my final moment... and then my stepfather would’ve been pissed until 3 months later.

THOSE are the (2) reasons why I walked to (S.A.N.G./Stratton Air National Guard), because I believe it...
was a deadly ass-drone.

Literally walked from where I live, to fuckin’ Stratton. Wasn’t a real fun walk. 
But I got there, and this was in the early stage of COVID when social distancing was still a thing people 
were still figuring out. No one was at the gate. So, I just sat there and waited cause I know they saw me. 
When I tried to talk to them about it:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Guard 1 : Hey bro, what’s goin’ on...?
Me      : So, not sure how to say this, but, I think I found something really important/dangerous.
Guard 2 : What is it?
Me      : I think it’s a drone.
Guard 3 : Yeah, so what...?
Me      : Sounds like a bird.
Guard 2 : NO WAY, bro... nuh-uh.
Me      : Yeah way, actually. 
          I have an audio recording of it...
Guard 1 : Bro, maybe somebody in Washington will give a shit, ya know?
Me      : You aren’t even gonna bother listening to it...?
Guard 2 : Nah, look pal. 
          You’re somethin’ else, let me tell ya...
Me      : I’m sayin’, I think this thing is dangerous.
Guard 1 : Look, WE’RE dangerous, alright...?
          Take you, and your *hand wavin’ around* bird recording, elsewhere.
Me      : Alright...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I couldn’t convey all of this shit to them without ya know, requiring complex machines, doodads, and algorithms.
They probably wouldn’t even give a shit if it was being used by serial killers, even if that’s what I knew then,
and even still, I could go back there right now, and they will say the same thing.

After I left Stratton, I walked toward Schenectady, and where the entrance to CP Rail is, a guy on a bicycle 
came out and said “Good luck on your journey, brother.”                                             (← FORESHADOWING)

So, check this out. Not only did these people think I was insane...? But I would go right ahead, and collect
ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE THAT THEY DIDN’T REALLY TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT.

It’s such a RECURRING THEME... Me...? Being more intelligent than most people. Them...? Thinking I’m insane.
Me...? Not being insane at all, just being a lot more intelligent... Them...? Failing to admit that’s what it is.

How many dozens of ways should I slice this...? I’m not insane... 
I’m just a lot more intelligent than most people. That’s ALL it is.

Look, I might be overgeneralizing some shit. The people at Stratton probably would care if they knew what 
the hell I was onto. The problem is, people expect you to have all the answers ahead of time, before you
even know what the hell is going on.

That is the main reason why you can’t just walk to a military base, and try to tell them that you’re worried
that some serial killers are using advanced weaponry made by the Central Intelligence Agency, or something.
Because, yeah. Without whipping out a security clearance or something like that, anyone hears you talking
about DEEP FAKES, or MIKE BAKER, or EDWARD SNOWDEN, or JULIEN ASSANGE...? People will IMMEDIATELY assume 
that you’re fucking insane, and they’ll start wiping their hands off too, *solved that fuckin’ problem*.
But no. I run into this problem quite a lot. Maybe someone should hook me up with a BADGE or a SECURITY
CLEARANCE...

$Book.AddSection(5,"Flashback [~] Gary McQueen",@"
The reason why I was thinking about heading to SCHENECTADY before I even went to STRATTON, is because I was 
certain that some dude who works at Rivers Casino, was using these fuckin’ remote code executions on the Acer 
Veritons back in 2019 when I was running [COMPUTER ANSWERS - 514 Main Street Bennington, VT 05201] between 
(01/29/19 – 07/04/19?). 

I still have to settle up with Ryan Hassett at some point, he’s the guy who runs Bringing You Vermont, it’s 
basically a shop and a deli with some pretty good food, across the street from the Cinema Theatre, and the 
Bennington Blotter, the newspaper company that has a cool painted horse sculpture in front of it.

Side point. I had a feeling that the computers (Acer Veritons) that I had in my shop kept REBOOTING themselves
cause some smart son of a bitch would cause them to RANDOMLY reboot themselves. I knew that’s not what was 
happening. But- sometimes people that know how to do shit like that, they get real cocky. So, they’ll cause 
the computer to reboot, and THEN, they may cheekingly message you on Facebook. 

A guy that works at Rivers, was fuckin’ with those computers remotely. I don’t know that for certain, but he 
got cocky and sent me a message on Facebook, after these things just rebooted again. This dude was using 
(RCE/Remote Code Execution)’s to do that, it’s basically proving that you can shove a large cucumber up your
ass, and then like some sick fuck... you just don’t really care if people wanna see you do such a thing. This
dude at Rivers Casino, had no problem, he’s like “Here, I can shove a cucumber in my ass.” But- I didn’t care.

Anyway I had a feeling that Gary McQueen was looking out for me at one point back around Easter in 2019. 
I don’t think GARY was actually doing anything malicious, I think he just got curious when I first called 
him back in October 2018 after I was managing the Schenectady store at 1119 State Street.

Gary and I used to work together at (17 Corporate Woods, Albany NY | KeyCorp). Gary, thought he could type 
as fast as I can... a lot of guys I worked with, thought they could. Strange thing is that my management 
NEVER PUT ME ON CHATS. Anyway, whatever. I type really fast, never once was offered the opportunity to run
the ERC position I had under the company chat feature, which is how most people contacted the ERC.

Regardless, all of those are side points. Someone was using these RCE’s to cause the Acer Veritons to 
suddenly reboot themselves. I don’t believe Gary was the one doing that at all, but he WAS warning me, and 
it was a very chilling warning...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Gary : Hey bro.
Me   : How’s it goin’, bro, long time no see...?
Gary : Ehhh, livin’ the life man.
       Bangin’ mad bitches.
Me   : Cool. 
       What’s up with you...?
Gary : Secure Digits Plus, eh...?
       Tell me about this “security” thing you’re doin’...
       *at the time I wasn’t sure how to explain it to people, wasn’t remotely close to what I’m doing now*
Me   : Uh, well, network security, building a program that does cool shit with VMs and MDT.
Gary : Bro, anybody can do THAT...
       To me...?
       Security is all about curb stomping identity theft, cybercrime, and stuff like that...
       Anything else...?
       That ain’t security, buddy.
Me   : Yeah...?
Gary : Yeah.
       All that stuff you said...?
       It’s all stuff *taps chest* I, Gary McQueen, can do with my eyes closed, practically...
Me   : Bullshit. 
       Prove it.
Gary : Nah, can’t right now, got the Feds watchin’ me.
       Not allowed to even LOOK AT, a computer...
       Let alone HAVE one...
Me   : Oh, wow.
Gary : Yep.
       Bein’ a badass’ll do that to ya.
Me   : So, how are you having this conversation with me, if you can’t even LOOK AT, a computer. 
Gary : Magic. 
Me   : Bro, I’m no idiot.
Gary : Alright, so you’re learning how to program with Pshell, eh...?
Me   : Yeah buddy, takin’ shit to the next level.
Gary : *sneers* Buddy, you’ve got a lot to learn, I’ll tell ya that much...
Me   : Yeah...?
Gary : Yeah buddy. 
       Long road ahead of ya.
Me   : Alright bro.
       So, I need a sensei to show me the way, then.
Gary : Ok.
       Let me see what you got goin’ on.
Me   : <sends script>
Gary : Oh wow, your code just gave my computer AIDS, bro...
Me   : C’mon dude.
       Let’s be realistic here.
Gary : Alright, so... the way that I, an actual EXPERT at programming, write my Pshell...?
       I don’t follow the conventional order that everybody else does.
       I’m like a fuckin’ code magician.
       Like, David Copperfield merged with Jesse “The Body” Ventura...
       A keyboard warrior, nonetheless.
Me   : Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh.
Gary : Look, a lot of people’s morality swings around and slides around aimlessly...
       The answers lie within the infrastructure of our hearts and minds.
       Remember that.
Me   : Alright man. Got it.
Gary : Hey, before I go though, I just wanna let you know...
       The people you think are your friends...?
Me   : Yeh...?
Gary : They’re not your friends.
Me   : Alright, who...?
Gary : You’re gonna have to find out, pal.
Me   : *pause* Uh, you know that’s not real helpful, right?
Gary : Oh well. 
       They’re there, man...
Me   : *pause* Dude, what the hell, bro...?
Gary : *hands up* I’m just sayin’.
       What else do you want from be bro...?
Me   : Uh, dude just says “Trust no one, Scully. The truth is out there.”
       ...somehow doesn’t realize how ominous or vague he’s being.
Gary : You’ll know when the time comes, dude.
Me   : Oh, cool. 
       Thanks a lot bro, mad helpful.
Gary : No prob. 
       Later.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

At least Gary gave me some pretty good advice after all. He probably does type mad fast by the way. 
Regardless, it might deplete most people’s sanity if they take it as seriously as I did. I think Gary 
was using a remote access technique that doesn’t use a [program*]. It just uses a [PROTOCOL*].

Then again, he could’ve been bullshitting me, and it could’ve been a conveniently arranged coincidence, where 
he just APPEARED to be messaging me at nearly the EXACT MOMENT that I felt like somebody was watching me...

Probably sounds like SCHIZOPHRENIA to think somebody’s watching you ALL the time. I didn’t think that was 
happening to me at the time, at all. HOWEVER, it WAS a SPORADIC thing BEFORE (01/15/19), because that was 
when I learned about how mass surveillance programs can be ABUSED and then USED against people that run a 
a business. 

I don’t imagine that MICHAEL ZURLO has anyone on staff that knows what a CVE, DDOS, or RANSOMWARE attack is.
If he does...? Then THOSE people need to be INVESTIGATED for COMMITTING CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES from BEHIND THEIR
BADGES. That’s a FEDERAL matter, not just a COUNTY or STATE matter. It became a FEDERAL matter when I went to 
BENNINGTON VT, and the some MORON decided to use the SAME EXACT EXPLOIT... but, uh-oh. I was in VERMONT, then. 

It crossed state lines. That’s now a FEDERAL matter. Not long after that, it BECAME a 24/7 surveillance team. 
Not SCHIZOPHRENIA, but- actual people that do real dirty shit that they don’t get arrested for, because of how
RICH/COOL/AWESOME/etc. they are. Why would someone do this to me, specifically...? 
Well, I think it has something to do with my father’s death, and (Nfrastructure/Pickett) is where to look.

Regardless, Gary got in trouble for something... I lost contact with him. 
Didn’t stop me from being curious about what the hell he meant.

When I got to Freeman’s Bridge Road, I took a left toward Schenectady. Already planned on going there, anyway.
When I got to Schenectady, I took a video of the Riverfront area, as at the time, 
I had a feeling that an FBI man, was keeping tabs on me all the time.                      (← CHRIS MURPHY/RYAN WARD)

When I got to Rivers, it was obviously locked down, but whatever... I heard the bird in the distance, from 
the lobby area around Rivers. It was in front of [COLLEGE PARK HALL - 450 Nott St, Schenectady, NY 12308]
I once had a lawyer named Ron Deangelus, and we were driving through Schenectady.
He kept making this joke:

Ron : Nope. 
      But, you see *points* that street right there...?
Me  : Yeah.
Ron : Well, guess what street that is...?
Me  : ...is it Nott Street...?
Ron : Sure is.

Something drew me to Union College, not just the bird. The only link I can make between the Old County 
Courthouse 1719-US-9 across from Snyder’s Restaurant, is the historical society land markers.

| [0003, 0004, 0005]: Basically, taking some pictures of S.A.N.G. from the other side of the river. Moments   | 
| prior, I saw this huge rock that looked like it might be more comfortable than passing out on the grass     |
| somewhere. Wasn’t comfortable at all. Anyway, I started walking away and then took these 3 shots. Then, (2) |    
| units from Niskayuna P.D. came up to me, MARRA WALTER and a dude stopped and spoke to me. I don’t remember  | 
| the entire conversation, but MARRA was really nice and she offered to give me a ride home to CLIFTON PARK.  |

Marra talked with me on the way to Clifton Park, I told her what I was researching regarding IDENTITY THEFT and 
CYBERCRIME, she seemed intrigued. Though I didn’t really quite understand that someone was knee deep in planning 
to kill me pretty soon. 

I had a HUNCH, but it’s pretty difficult to convey a HUNCH to other people without coming across as some type 
of ALARMIST or something. I told her about the audio recordings of the bird, she seemed to believe that it 
probably existed. 

She was actually pretty hot by the way. Considering the circumstances, I was pretty distracted.
I thanked her for the ride home and left it at that.

Sometimes I wonder if maybe people really are absent-minded. 
I’m sure people really AREN’T absent-minded at all, they just have a very difficult time thinking outside
of the box. For instance, people will say ‘If you were so smart, you’d be rich by now’. 

Not really... George Carlin is a prime example of someone that was probably smarter than all of the current 
top 10 billionaires in the world. That dude, knew philosophy inside and out. He also had a pretty good idea
that he was censored in the past. Another example of a smart bastard who was never RICH... Noam Chomsky.

Yeah, look. There are some smart bastards in that top 10 richest people in the world. But- that’s not the
only factor that got them to where they are. I discuss reasons why in 
[Chapter 5 – If you were smart, you’d be rich by now]

Regardless, it’s fuckin’ weird how people will read SOME of the shit I’ve posted, and say nothing. 
I would imagine, that if I made a 500 page book that describes how CENSORSHIP actually works, and why some
people do it... that it might alarm some people when they realize:
“They’ve been doing this to me my whole life, which means that I never had a fair chance at all. 
 Then, my father was murdered after HIS intellectual property was stolen. Pretty cool, huh...?”

However, this concept can be used to manipulate people, especially people that think they OWN everybody.
For good reasons or bad reasons, their intent can be derived.

I decided to go on the offensive, to basically take a bunch of pictures and raise some hell.
The reason why I did all of this...? Is because, I could already be a millionaire, I’m certain of it.
The reason why I’m not...? Is because a lot of people have stolen ideas I’ve had.

Just look at Anthony Russo, Adirondack Technologies. I used to hang out with that dude’s daughter, Nicole Russo.
Nicole used to date my buddy Peter Repp way back in the day.
Anyway, he had an office in the chocolate factory in Ballston Spa. 

Seemed like a cool guy, he told me about how he would set up DVR recording equipment back in like 2003. 
Then one time he like brought me out to Boston to install DirectTV for a place that makes submarines or 
something, and the dude never paid me for my time. I told him: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me :  You know, if you wanted to do things like an actual professional would...? 
      You could TOTALLY build a computer that works as a DVR.
Him : *eyebrows intrigued* Really...? 
      You could actually do that...?
Me  : Why, yes of course. 
      Pretty simple stuff.
      You just slap a computer box together, and get yourself a DVR capture card...
      ...and then add in a pretty decent size hard drive...?
      Boom.
      Done deal.
      Now you can really sell some fuckin’ surveillance systems...
Him : Well, maybe sometime you could show me how to build all of that.
Me  : Oh, dude... I could LITERALLY EMAIL YOU the BUILD...
Him : Oh you could, could you...?
Me  : Yeah man.
      Look.
      Maybe in 20 years I’ll look back on this conversation we’re having, and be pretty upset about how I just
      gave you a killer idea to steal from me and then run your whole entire business model off of, for like 15 
      of those years.
Him : Yeah, well...
      That’s tough, man.
      REAL tough...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

The point being, the man went ahead and started using an idea I gave him, and never once gave me any credit, or 
leads. That’s mainly because people love to steal each other’s ideas, especially if they’re worth money.

Now look. I’m not upset about that at all, because some people will actually build highly successful businesses
off of ideas that they never actually came up with... ONLY BECAUSE THEY HAD THE CONNECTIONS and the CAPITAL to
do so. You don’t actually need to be ORIGINAL with ANY IDEAS these days. Nope. Just literally, look at something
somebody else already did...? And find a way to mimic it right down to every component. 

That’s how Jeff Bezos is doin’ it with Blue Origin. 
You can do it too.

At some point in that day, I started to patrol around the town of Clifton Park and go on the offensive. 
I recorded video after video, took picture after picture.

| [0001, 0002]: Geese, they commonly populate the Clifton Park area in the summertime. A LOT of them can be   | 
| found over on the Shenendehowa School District plains, they love to hang out. They’re the campus spirit     | 
| animal. [0003]: Recording of me talking about the rabbits some more. I have some other ideas about what the | 
| future might be like to transport water, energy and data. [0004]: I basically walk around the Clifton Park  | 
| Public Safety Building making fun of (Rybak/Wormuth), because I believe they’re both involved in the RICO.  | 
| Considering that Mindy Wormuth was the former T/O Halfmoon Supervisor, and that Paul Amato got in deep shit | 
| with Bruce Tanski committing fraud and stuff, didn’t seem like a stretch to think that Lester was involved. |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

I wound up getting to the Clifton Park Public Safety Building, and found a few police cruisers running...  
I didn’t expect to find (4) NYSP cruisers running idle, unattended. I probably owe some of these cops an 
apology, but- in due time, for reasons I’ll explain later.

Then I took off toward Shen campus, basically reverse of the path that I used to walk down from the high school
through the woods. When I made it to campus, the clock-tower went off... 9PM. Walked a good way through the 
campus, until I saw a few vehicles just like, drivin’ mad slow, trying to be inconspicuous.

| [0005]: Rear of High School West, showing the moon in the distance (I believe). [0006]: Mistake shot my bad | 
| [0007]: Video I recorded that contains a few key details that show 1) red truck sorta stalking me on both   | 
| sides of Gowana, 2) black GMC Yukon Denali in front of Orenda, just sitting idle, running... 3) someone who | 
| was ABOUT to LUNGE at me from the Orenda Exercise Trail... and 4) the person that lunged at me, riding a    |
| bike at the tail end of the video with a neon light thing. The neon light thing is pretty important, cause  | 
| it is actually a CLUE, and a DISTINGUISHING FEATURE of these serial killers.                                |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

One of those vehicles was a red truck, which sorta stopped near the transportation garage. 
Pretty sure this truck was looking FOR ME, or AT ME. (IMG_0416.mov)

My theory THEN and my theory TODAY, is that I went to school with people that have been actively EXPLOITING 
the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001, SOMEHOW. Perhaps some of the older alumni from Shen were co-conspirators of the 
9/11 attacks. None of the KIDS I graduated with could’ve done that... not old enough.

But, people that graduated at least 3 years ahead of me, COULD HAVE, or even STAFF MEMBERS. 
This would make perfect sense when considering that SARATOGA COUNTY is the RICHEST COUNTY in New York State.

In other words, SARATOGA COUNTY has MORE MONEY than ANY OTHER COUNTY in New York State. 
That’d include: the (5) boroughs of NEW YORK CITY, ALBANY, KINGSTON/POUGHKEEPSIE, ROCHESTER, SYRACUSE...
SARATOGA COUNTY has MORE MONEY than ANY OTHER COUNTY in New York State. (← NOT AN OPINION, IT’S A FACT)

Between Shenendehowa Campus and Clifton Commons, ALL of the vehicles I saw, were driving MAD slowly... 

I had a feeling that all of these people knew where I was, and they had a [direct line of sight with me*], and 
the reason they would [SPECIFICALLY be looking for me*], is for (2) reasons: 
(1) I posted a link to the video of the bird,
(2) I sent a video (Matura/Smith) about the (NIST/National Institute of Standards and Technology) report being 
VERY flawed. It was probably a little over the top with the language, but probably made a very compelling point.

They never said anything, maybe they told other people. I did swear a lot on it, and used some slurs, which 
I sorta feel bad about. But- it stands to reason that fellow countrymen committing an act of treason against 
the United States, is probably a LOT more offensive than my language. 

Consider it may not be a very a crazy idea AT ALL, to ask questions like:

Someone (in/from) Shen had something to do with the terrorist attack of 9/11/2001. I’m damn certain of it too. 
The reason why, is as follows... “Keep your eyes on, Verizon” back in around the date of 9/11/2001.

...they’ve been RECORDING EVERYTHING. 

If people want to get court subpoenas for recordings from the phone company, then whatever – but the 
[National Security Agency*] ALSO saves that shit. 

They’ve been playing this game versus one another...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Nat. Sec. Agency : We’ve got everything bro.
                   Can’t be playin’ these fuckin’ games with us, we will fuck you up.
Phone Companies  : Bullshit, we’ve got everything.
Nat. Sec. Agency : Nope. 
                   We have more of your own records, than YOU do.
                   So, *pointing* YOU suck a fuckin’ dick, bro.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Pretty sure the phone companies have been saving EVERYTHING, so when they pretend they don’t have it...?
Aw, well, there’s a place full of a lot more experienced engineers than those dipshits...
It’s kinda why I kept poking fun at Verizon. Their service does NOT suck, it’s the best there is, actually. 
I had Verizon Wireless for over 10 years, established a plan with them when I quit working for my uncle at 
the deli in October 2003. 

Had this service for SO MANY YEARS... until THEY fucked up by trying to charge me `$600 for a single month, 
after I took ownership of a phone line from my cousin Tom/Meghan’s phone plan, for my kid’s mother, Jennifer.
Which, this bitch never even used it or managed it. When I found out why there was a bill for like, fuckin 4x 
more than my highest bill ever...? They were like “OoOoOooohhh, you didn’t check the BOX on the website... 
to keep the other line inactive...” So, I said: “Nah, I’m not payin’ that. Suck a fuckin’ dick, bro.” 
^ This right here, is bullshit. It’s like “walk into a trap because you weren’t payin’ attention. 
Nah. Fuck you guys. That’s garbage.

One of those vehicles was a black GMC Yukon at Orenda, just running, nobody appeared to be in it, and then 
Orenda Exercise Trail “Always had a feeling that this place was dangerous” *movement in the bushes* 
“I will call 911 right now... The NSA is always listening to me, etc.” ← pretty sure someone was about to 
lunge at me and was like “Oh. Well, maybe I shouldn’t try to kill ya then... ffs.”

I really do think that these people saw me as an immediate threat THEN, and still do. 
They have probably killed a lot of people, but they don’t realize why I keep breaking their best defenses. 
It’s literally because I write all of my own code, and do all of my own work.
Not many people in society can do ALL of the things I can do, like PAVEL ZAICHENKO and DWAYNE COONRADT.

I’d even go so far as to say probably 90% of the people that have ever worked at NFRASTRUCTURE.
A lot of people prefer to press CTRL+C over work someone ELSE did, and then hit CTRL+V. Copy, paste, done.

Here’s why I added NFRASTRUCTURE to that list... 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y05kPm-CjVIALi6r8CNPMlIRnXvMtPpD/view?usp=sharing     
It looks like JESSE PICKETT may have been hittin’ CTRL+C, and then CTRL+V like, before NFRASTRUCTURE existed.
Like, in 1988-1989. Just gonna keep casually dropping such a CRITICAL PIECE OF EVIDENCE like that, in this book.

You gotta figure, the queers who attacked MY network at: COMPUTER ANSWERS 1602 US-9, Clifton Park, NY 12065...?
They’ve probably never written a single line of (GOOD/ORIGINAL) code in their entire life.
I mean, maybe they have... but I really sincerely doubt it.

When people WRITE THEIR OWN STUFF...? THAT’S how people become TALENTED...
Sometimes people who have so-called EXPERIENCE, they may not actually KNOW HOW TO WRITE THEIR OWN CODE.
Sometimes their so-called EXPERIENCE, is literally being the most skilled person there could ever be, at: 
copying and pasting someone elses’ code. The industry has a lot of this going on... 

Not saying everybody in the industry DOES this...? But, many of them do.
It’s ONE thing to copy and paste if you’re going to TEAR SOMETHING APART AND LEARN HOW IT WORKS.
It’s a different story entirely when people literally make (VERY FEW) → (NO CHANGES WHATSOEVER)...
...because that is actually called PLAGIARISM. 
Yeah, intellectual property theft like the stuff Mark Zuckerberg commits...? Sometimes it is plagiarism. 
That is actually worthy of criminal offenses in some cases. So is censorship, believe it or not.
I’m willing to look past it, but I know this dude is gonna get offended if I keep saying it. Oh well.

As for the cars driving slowly on Shen campus, they don’t realize that I know about the fuckin’ evil spirit 
of Shenendehowa, the [queer/English Assassin] that killed many American colonists, otherwise known as the 
“boogeyman”. He is FASTER than you, and somehow ALWAYS A STEP AHEAD... and HE KILLS PEOPLE IN THEIR SLEEP. 
Sometimes he will even put it in people’s butts too, probably doesn’t sound like a whole lot of fun, huh...?
Well, the Geese of Shenendehowa are the animal spirits that roam the plains of Shenendehowa as well.
They fuckin’ hate this prick, and they start to make plenty of noise every time he tries to make his move...

Which means, he can never catch me off guard. 
Not saying this fuckin’ prick won’t ever get me SOMEDAY... 

But, this document will probably save a lot of people. 
These people keep making the mistake of thinking I’m as oblivious as everyone else...

Guy1  : There he is. 
Lady1 : Fuckin’ nuisance man...
Lady2 : He’ll never notice us in our minivans...
Guy1  : As long as we just drive away slowly...? 
        What can he do...?
Guy2  : Heh, nothing really, pal.
        Just gonna be like putting a carrot on a stick, and watch this dumb sumbitch chase it.
Guy1  : The guy in the bushes didn’t get em though.
Lady2 : Yeh, he told me that he was like “That trail has always struck me as dangerous”
Lady1 : Why do we ALL drive minivans...?
Guy2  : Storage space, fuel economy...
Guy1  : I don’t like driving minivans. 
        I have a Camry.
Lady2 : Everyone loves a good Camry.
Lady1 : Ugh, Camry’s are good.
Guy3  : Fuck your Camry’s and minivans, I drive a Lambo.
Lady1 : The hell you do...
Guy3  : Nah, I drive a fuckin’ Lambo, lady...
        I don’t even care if I scrape the undercarriage if I drive over speed bumps.
Lady2 : *confused* Wait...
        ...why would you even drive a Lambo over speed bumps...
        ...when the suspension is dropped so low...?
        That’s gotta be the dumbest thing a Lambo owner could do.
Guy3  : Uh, cause I fuckin’ can...?
Guy1  : Bro, you’re almost as ridiculous as this Michael C. Cook right here.
Guy3  : Not if I own a Lambo...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

As long as you’re MORE intelligent than they are, their fuckin’ MASTERS DEGREES won’t give them the ability 
to outsmart you, or be more observant at all. Nah, some people with a fuckin’ MASTERS DEGREE might say (2+2=5).

Sometimes a rich dude will say that too, even one with as much money as BRUCE TANSKI, or drives a Lambo. 
That’s moronic. 2 plus 2 has never equaled 5, in history. I really do think that the BRITISH and the RUSSIANS,
they started telling people in AMERICA, that 2 plus 2 equals 5, JUST TO SEE IF AMERICANS WERE DUMB ENOUGH TO 
REPEAT THAT. Not even fuckin’ kidding. Because, if a cool kid, or rich bastard says (2+2=5)...? Then, that 
MUST mean that’s what it is. So, don’t be an asshole like ME, and try to “correct” people. Alright...? Good.

Nah, that shit is retarded. 2 plus 2 never equals 5. Ever. But, I imagine most people will do what Dwayne 
Coonradt does: “Would you suck some dude’s dick for a million dollars...?” I know HE would, cause he told me.
If people get pissed off that I just made that statement, oh well. (2+2=4). 

I really want to give my 6th grade teacher MRS. MATURA, a benefit of the doubt... and hope to fuckin’ god, that 
this lady DOES NOT THINK (2+2=5)... at a bare minimum. If she thinks I’m wrong about 9/11...? I’m okay with 
that. But, the (2+2=5) thing...? That’s just crossin’ the fuckin’ last line for me... If SHE thinks that, then 
it is literally time to give up now- it’s over.  

Cause. MRS. MATURA started teaching the kids that sometimes (2+2=5). NOW, the ENTIRE WORLD, is basically FUCKED. 
In a way that there’s just... no coming back from EVER again. Everybody lost. Might as well just, stop trying. 
Everybody may as well just start rolling around, and cry themselves to sleep if they’re anything like me... 

Even if YOU have cried ALL the tears you could possibly cry...? Tough cookies. Gotta keep doing it anyway. 
Cause the COOL people kept saying (2+2=5), now everybody thinks that... now the human race is literally doomed.
(^ Me being dramatic)

I knew that some of their peers were watching me. Might have a dead spirit protecting me, giving me clues 
and advanced warning. Talking about my father. He and I both know I’m not gonna be the idiot that doesn’t 
notice a bunch of people driving around mad slowly...

Then, (2) dudes drive up to each other in the Clifton Commons parking lot.
One dude being the CP Public Safety officer, another driving a white Honda Fit looking thing with a damaged 
front headlight. Like 2 queers pretending to be straight. Dudes who fuck girls, will see it VERY CLEARLY...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Guy1 : Oh hey man, fuckin’ *checks watch* you know where I could get my headlight “topped off”?
Guy2 : Topped off, huh? 
       What you need some headlight fluid or somethin’...?
Guy1 : Yeh. 
       Check it out, I like, got in an accident. 
       I’m kinda following that guy that’s walking over there...
       ...but make this conversation look inconspicuous, alright? *wink*
Guy2 : I don’t get it, I drive a Clifton Park Public Safety vehicle... 
       ...are you asking me to blow you...?
       Cause I could swear ya just winked at me, dude.
Guy1 : I wasn’t, but if you’re offerin’...
       *I wind up walking no more than like 20 feet away*
Guy2 : *clears throat* SO YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU REPLACE YOUR FUSES AND STUFF...
Guy1 : Fuses eh? 
       ...What are those...?
Me   : You guys are both fuckin’ queers, I heard ya from back there. 
       Pretty dead giveaway, bro.
Guy2 : Hey~! *hand on hip, which is a feminine gesture* Who are you callin’ queers...?
Guy1 : Yeah man *zips his buddies fly up, ALSO a feminine gesture*
       Who are you callin’ queers bro, we both bang mad bitches... (← queers say this though)
Me   : Nah. 
       I’m not fuckin’ convinced if your buddy just zipped up your fly. 
       Ya know?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Look, I don’t know who they were. These two dudes, one was driving a White Honda with a broken headlight 
assembly, the other, was in a Public Safety vehicle, and I think that they were part of this “security team” 
that was following me.

I walked up 146A to Sherwood Forest, or whatever it’s called. I was calling the judge (Wormuth/Rybak) a queer 
the whole entire time... cause Clifton Park NY has been being extorted over 20 years now, I know people heard 
me as I was walking. I probably owe Rybak an apology. At the same time, I haven’t INVALIDATED my suspicions.

I was making every effort to be as loud and audible as possible. There’s a 9/11 monument in Sherwood Forest, so 
I took pictures of that. Then, like a WILD man...? I was in real quick, then I came right back out, and took off.

Look chum, this whole chapter here is about a place called “Jonesville”. Only badasses are allowed in this part 
of town. So, if you’re not a badass...? Then, fuck you, dude. You’re not even ALLOWED on this god damn street. 
SO... that is what the “Jonesville” sign ACTUALLY says. 

I know that someone is gonna try and say “The sign doesn’t say that, dude...” 
Well, I’ve got news for ya... a sign never tells the whole story, nah.
Gotta carry the mightiest urban dictionary that was ever written... in order to read that sign CORRECTLY. 

I’m joking. This place is full of the most agreeable people anyone could ever meet. Used to deliver Metroland 
to the Main Street Grille, and I can’t remember the name of the place at Main/Longkill Rd./East Line... but it 
was always full of people that couldn’t get enough of this place. Day in, day out, the place fully stacked with 
a long list of regular, every-day people that were apparently the best in the industry, at makin good food.

One day I happened to run into the hottest girl in high school, years after graduating. She was walking up to 
this place with some other pretty hot broad (typical behavior for this girl, actually...) They saw me and said: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

  Girl 1 : Damn. 
           Look at THAT dude, parked right there in the most obnoxious spot possible...
           I know who that guy is...
  Girl 2 : Oh do you...?
  Girl 1 : Yep, I do alright.
  Me     : *scoffs, shakes head* You don’t know who I am...
  Girl 1 : Yeah I do.
  Me     : Yeah...?
  Girl 1 : Yyyyyyyup.
  Me     : *eyebrows making a question, slight head nod* Alright, what’s my name then...?
           Hm...?
  Girl 1 : Michael.
  Me     : Well, shit.
           Guess you DO know who I am...
  Girl 1 : Yyyyyyyup. 
  Me     : Yeah, well...
           I know who YOU are, too.
  Girl 1 : Oh yeah...?
  Me     : Yep.
  Girl 2 : Yeah...?
           Well, who is she then...?
  Me     : That’s literally the hottest girl in high school.
           Or at least she WAS.
           Obviously still pretty fuckin’ hot too...
           So...
  Girl 2 : Yeah, but you didn’t say her NAME.
  Girl 1 : Yeah, Michael~!
  Me     : Look, *checks watch* I gotta get back to work.
           *opens car door, gets in* 
           You were the hottest girl in high school, can’t remember your name though...
  Girl 1 : *gasps* No fucking way dude...
           You did not just compliment me twice, and then forget MY name...
  Girl 2 : Who does that...?
           You just *hand wavin’ around* park in the most obnoxious spot possible, like you own the place,
           compliment this girl right here, and then take off...?
  Me     : Starts with a T ends in an A. Later. *drives off cause he’s mad busy*
  Girl 1 : ...he’s right though.
  Girl 2 : Wow. Thought he was bullshittin’ ya.

It didn’t actually go down like that at all, but sometimes you have to add some context to the last time you 
may have seen the hottest girl in high school, cause maybe she didn’t know that I was a father already... ya 
know? What if I did actually forget her name...? Would a girl that happened to have been the hottest girl in 
high school be OFFENDED if I didn’t remember her name, but just kept sayin’ 
“Well, you were the hottest girl in high school...”

To be honest, it probably cancels each other out... cause, you forgot her actual name, dude. That’s fucked up.
Can’t just say: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me  : Hey YOU, the REAL HOT girl... 
Her : *not paying attention, probably doesn’t realize you’re talking to her*
Me  : Hey~! YOU, the mad hot girl with her hair in a bun.
Her : *she realizes SHE’s got HER hair in a bun alright... so she looks around*
      *she sees ya, she points at herself* Who, me...?
Me  : Yeah, you~!
      What other real hot girl with her hair in a bun could I be talkin’ about...?
Her : *she glances around, no other girl even remotely close to as hot as she is, is anywhere in sight...*
      Well, that’s not my name, dude...
Me  : Nah I know that, but I forgot it...
Her : *now she’s pissed, cause you forgot her name*
      How could you forget MY name...?
Me  : Uh, cause I’m an idiot sometimes...?
Her : Oh.
      Alright...
      At least you admit it...
Me  : Hey.
      You wanna hang out or what...?
      Hm...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Cause she will... be pretty upset that you forgot her name. She may or may not want to hang out... 
...might be sort of “on the fence” cause the notion that you literally forgot THIS girls name...?
Well, hell hath no fury like a woman’s scorn... she’s gonna hold that against you for not remembering her name.
But, I gotta tell ya, it is utterly ridiculous to think that I’d ever forget THIS girl’s name. So...

Went all the way down Ushers road and found some VERIZON FIOS “INFRACTIONS”. (VERIZON breaking the law.

When I was on Main St., I didn’t “forecast” that some shit was gonna go down there. 
But, there’s literally a fuckin’ Verizon building THERE, and off of SOLAR DRIVE, and even GROOMS ROAD. 
Why so many fuckin’ Verizon buildings in Clifton Park, but- no FIOS...? Hm...? 
I mean, Verizon Wireless will practically blow everybody that walks in the door...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

VZW      : Welcome to Verizon Wireless, sir.
           Would you like me to suck your dick, while you wait for somebody to come help ya out...?
Customer : Uh... nah, that’s quite alright...
VZW      : I mean *shakes head* you’re SURE now...?
           I have a jaw of steel, basically.
Customer : NAH, ITS TOTALLY FINE...
           *looks at friend*
           *whispers* See what I mean, dude...?
           *shakes head, whispers* Every time I come here, they literally SAY that...
Friend   : Wow.
           I mean, I could really go for somethin’ like that...
Customer : Hey ma’am...?
VZW      : Why, yes sir...?
           How may I be of service...?
Customer : Uh, my friend here says he wouldn’t mind somethin’ like that.
Friend   : Nah, not at all.
VZW      : Are YOU a Verizon Wireless customer...?
Friend   : Well, no.
VZW      : Awwww. Well, I’m sorry, sir. 
           Unfortunately we have a strict policy to only service existing Verizon Wireless customers...
Friend   : I mean, I USED to have Verizon Wireless.
VZW      : Hey, that sounds great and everything...?
           But, you have to be an EXISTING customer.
           THEN, we’ll will basically suck you dry, no questions asked, really.
           Sometimes we will even blow you against your will, Louis CK calls it the “rape blowjob”.
           That’s where our service *REALLY* shines.
Friend   : Wow.
           Do you... swallow the load too, or...?
VZW      : Well, of course we swallow the load, that comes standard...!
           Wouldn’t be winning any JD Powers and Associates Awards for being the best in the industry...
           ...if we didn’t swallow the load by default.
           Jeez.
           What kind of animals do you think we are...?
Customer : Hey, what if I just let him use my phone while we wait...?
VZW      : Sir, I’m afraid it doesn’t actually work like that... 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Verizon offers the best wireless service in existence... right?
However it seems way too convenient that the FIOS service isn’t here...

Well, I have news for everybody. Verizon FIOS is actually available in Clifton Park. 
You MAY not even have to PAY Verizon for this connection, either, believe it or not.

Yeah, ON PAPER...? 
The FIOS service isn’t OFFICIALLY available.
However, IN PRACTICE...? If you’re a PHARMACY, DOCTORS OFFICE, SCHOOL, live in Country Knolls, or... 
if you know a guy that works for VERIZON, OR you’re somebody like ZAPPONE/TANSKI/SOMEONE IMPORTANT...? 
Then you can actually get Verizon FIOS. How/why...? It’s simple. You just have to be important enough, that’s it.
Most of the time, they won’t even charge somebody if they’re really important. Because they live for the notion
of serving certain people, and giving them a leg up over everybody else. Because, who cares about what’s fair...?
You’re important. So, it’s important that THEY treat you like the MUCH MORE IMPORTANT person you truly are.

Otherwise, if you don’t fit either one of these conditions...? Then fuck you, pal.

You’re not even allowed to like it when Verizon tells you to go fuck yourself, either. Nope. You gotta be real 
upset about not being able to get FIOS, and cry like a little girl who had ALL of her barbie dolls taken away.

It’s not gonna HELP you get FIOS from Verizon if you act that way, but that is exactly how they WANT people 
to act. If you don’t act like that...? It isn’t quite as entertaining or comedic to them... That’s why I 
think a perfect solution would be, just peel all of the VERIZON stickers off of the entire length of the cable,
and replace those stickers with “NOT VERIZONS ANYMORE HAHAHA”, and we’ll see how they like THAT... 
Wouldn’t even NEED to take a fuckin’ hatchet to each and every single fiber optic backbone cable that’s labeled
“VERIZON”, in the town of Clifton Park, NY, nah. You just take em to court and say something like “I don’t know
how the hell these guys managed to plug their own network onto my fiber optic cables...? 

But I’m REAL pissed, dude.
Those are million dollar cables, and these fucks are gonna go ahead and steal MY god damn cable...?
You guys have some fuckin’ nerve dude...
LEGALLY SPEAKING, those cables shouldn’t really even be there, but they just went ahead and did it anyway.

What if the WHOLE TOWN of Clifton Park, NY could give Spectrum a big ol’ middle finger and say,
“Oh we went ahead and upgraded to Google FIOS. It’s WAY better than Verizon FIOS.”

Instead of just a couple fuckin’ neighborhoods where people who work for Verizon, actually live...
...they could totally make it available all over town. 
Ya know...? Right now, the guys who work for Verizon and have the FIOS service going to their place...?
They’re bein’ a real nice guy by offering it to other people. Instead of charging people `$1000 a month...?
Now they’re charging `$10 a month. *tapping side of head* Now they’re thinkin’ 1) all day long...

MAYBE the reason they’re NOT doing that yet, is because they don’t see how `$10 a month for unlimited home internet
AND cell service, would be REAL cool. That’s cause they’re ALL lazy fucks that “FEEL” like they “work hard”.

The reason that these lazy fucks at Verizon and Spectrum “FEEL” like they “work hard” is because they’re “morons”.
It’s basically the entire conversation. Nothing else needs to be stated. But, here’s a couple of examples as to
what I actually mean by both 1) Verizon and 2) Spectrum, are full of lazy incompetent fucks that get paid a lot
of money but aren’t very skilled at what they do. (← I am definitely roasting some people that have less talent 
than I do. I’m doing it because they get paid a lot of money and they STILL suck at what they do compared to me.)

| The best way I can phrase it is that the person DOING this to me, kept saying “Look how small my dick is!” |
| And I was like “Nah, I’m all set.” They didn’t really get it, they thought I wanted to SEE, but I didn’t.  |

Look I have no doubt that maybe 10% of the engineers at SPECTRUM or VERIZON, may actually have an equivalent 
amount of expertise as I do. The people at the National Security Agency have a lot of fuckin experience and 
skill though. But, I very rarely ever meet people THAT SKILLED face to face, if ever. I’m not really trying 
to insult the people at Spectrum/Verizon so much as I am attempting to convey that I’ve been doing this for 
about *checks watch* 21+ years, which is when I first studied Cisco Certified Network Academy and Microsoft 
System Administration in 01-03 when I was still in high school, using Hyper-Terminal to connect to switches 
and routers, and Novell Netware IPX/SPX. Sorta went obsolete.

I have done THEIR job where I get into a little bucket and have to anchor security cameras to the side of 
concrete buildings and drill holes for the mounts and even traverse some networking cable, whether it’s 
coaxial or Ethernet... I can literally do their job as well as develop applications and repair hardware, 
and configure networking equipment. There’s a reason why the beginning of the document has an American flag 
with my specialties listed on it. Application Development, Virtualization, Networking and Hardware 
Magistration, but also graphic design. 

I literally ran a dude’s company FOR him because he was a LAZY BASTARD who wouldn’t do that HIMSELF, and that 
company is called COMPUTER ANSWERS. I have repaired smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, servers, consoles, 
I can configure routers, servers, switches, access points, I can flash the firmware, I can use unix, linux, 
Windows 10/11, Windows Server 2012+, really I can even go as far back as MS-DOS. 1996, I used to play 
Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, then I also played Starcraft, Quake, Quake II, Quake III Arena.

If people REALLY wanna see what I used to do as a GRAPHIC DESIGN ARTIST back in 2001...? 
https://web.archive.org/web/*/planetquake.com/bfg20k

When I tell people that the people who work at Verizon and Spectrum are LAZY... it’s the truth.
Time Warner Cable was 5x the company that Spectrum is, they CONSTANTLY upgraded the network, it was a never
ending task for them. They sold out and ever since...? Spectrum has sucked a lot of dicks.

If you go and sell their best service for a fraction of the price...? Obviously they’re gonna get pissed about
how suddenly, people are using their fiber optic lines and not actually needing to pay Verizon a dime.
However, they should consider that the TECHNOLOGY that they are UTILIZING, is from a DEAD MAN named NIKOLA TESLA,
and his fucking INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY was STOLEN by their EMPLOYER, and the FEDERAL COMMUNICATION COMMISSION.

So ultimately, `$10 for unlimited HOME INTERNET and CELL SERVICE...? That’s gonna piss them off really badly if 
someone manages to use THEIR OWN NETWORK TO DO THAT. They’re gonna work REAL FUCKIN’ HARD TO PREVENT THAT FROM
HAPPENING, but it will literally be the ONLY time ANY of them do anything that could even REMOTELY be considered 
“hard work”, or like “involved”. Nah, what they do, isn’t hard. They’re lazy.

I could single-handedly outperform every engineer at Spectrum and Verizon. People should really place bets to see
if I’m willing to put my money where my mouth is. They could make this FIOS service available all over town, but- 
the reason it isn’t yet, is cause they’re cocksuckers, and they don’t want everyone to have the same advantage. 

The people who work for Verizon, they’re not real bright, either... The reason being, they will tell people
“Yeah, we’ve earned 10+ JD Powers and Associates awards for being the best in the industry and having such 
unrivaled, top-notch service... right...? Heh. But, I’ve never once actually had this service myself...”

          ...until your residential FIOS service is OFFICIALLY available, AND, anyone that CURRENTLY...

          Ultimatum: `$10M per month, and then those lines can remain and you don’t have to offer FIOS.
          OR, offer FIOS within the next (5) days, because this is class action lawsuit material.
          But also, anyone that has been getting FIOS prior to NOW, will be charged `$1000 a month, for 
          each day where YOUR FIOS SERVICE WAS ALREADY BEING PROVIDED.
Verizon : Nobody in Clifton Park HAS FIOS.
CP      : Listen moron.
          This kid took fuckin’ pictures of it (2) years ago.
          Found several infractions and instances where the service GOES TO RESIDENCES.
          You know you are literally fucked, if you say OR do anything that doesn’t sound like...
          “Alright... we’ll offer FIOS I guess...”
Verizon : But we’re a bunch of greedy cocksuckers that don’t feel like doin’ that...
CP      : Yeah, no shit. 
          You have (5) days to come to your decision.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/ 

Some people have been getting FIOS without offering it to everybody else. Spectrum/Charter Communications, 
is essentially owned by someone that’s a very rich bastard, but they are still the puppeteer here, where they 
can access the fiber optic lines and then downgrade the quality/speed of the connection so that they can 
aggregate how much profit those cables can generate.

Bell Atlantic, AT&T, and Verizon, are essentially the same company. AT&T and Verizon, look like COMPETITORS.
But- it’s a lot like saying someone owns Burger King, McDonalds, AND Wendys... Yeah, they basically sell a 
different burger, and everything else... but- the same person owns them all. In THEIR case, that’s not true.

In the case of the telecommunications companies...? 
It’s something to consider, because it could very well be more true than people think.
The way you gotta think of it is like this... Can a man have sex with 10 females at the same time...?

I mean, theoretically, maybe...? But you’d have to be a fuckin’ total moron to think that guy will ever have the 
ability to grow an additional 9 dicks... that way, he can have sex with 10 females at once.
However, that’s literally how moronic Verizon Communications actually is.

If fiber optics can deliver billions of DVD’s at the same time, then why is everybody forced to pay such a 
ridiculously high amount of money for access to the internet...? Even if the rate is pretty low in some cases...
...I think everybody deserves to be able to LIVE STREAM CONTENT FROM THEIR DEVICE IN 4K to the INTERNET from a 
CELL SIGNAL... can’t do that because 4K videos are actually pretty massive. Over a cell tower connection,
that would definitely cause some bandwidth issues. However, for WIRED connections, that makes plenty of sense.

I am generalizing this here to some degree, because, technically it’s not the same person if it’s just a real
close friend, or family member, or third cousin that all somehow magically cooperate with one another as if they
were a 100% single guy owning every single one and making all of the decisions... 

The truth is, THAT IS WHAT A MONOPOLY IS. Michael Whitacre and Oliver Robinson were told this shit, like...
*checks watch* 2 fuckin’ years ago. Wanna know how much has changed...? Oh. Nothing... 
So, MONOPOLY EXISTING FOR AN ADDITIONAL 2 YEARS = CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT MATERIAL.

Suppose as long as they MAIL each other the Death Star plans, and then they carry the envelope on foot 
across town, and then mail the COPY of the Death Star plans over to another place in a different country, 
and then all of those letters make their way to the queen of England, or the royal family... 

Then she’ll have to wait for the final instructions where all hell nearly breaks loose...

Instructions : Alright, so you’ve got all 13 compartments...?
Queen        : Yes.
Instructions : Good, excellent.
               Now for the final task...
               *long pause*
Queen        : What the hell, dude...?
Instructions : You waited this long, right...?
Queen        : Yes...
Instructions : Ok, perfect.
               Come back to the location where you’ve read this letter, in 24 hours.
Queen        : This is bullshit, bro.
Instructions : Look, this is the very last thing left for you to do...
               ...before utter world domination is in your hands.
Queen        : Well, alright.
               *24 hours later* Alright, I’m BACK.
Instructions : Alright, awesome. 
               Now, cut every letter from each compartment, and reverse their order...
               ...tape everything back together.
Queen        : Oh, holy hell dude, THAT’S gonna take like, days...
Instructions : Milady, you’ve waited years... what’s another few days to execute the instructions...?
Queen        : You know, I’m getting’ REAL old there, chum.
               Can’t just do backflips at any given moment like I used to...
               I need a couple hours to wake up every day...
Instructions : Alright, reverse the order of all 13 compartments, when you’re done, go to the place where you
               read the PREVIOUS letter.
Queen        : Oh my god.
               Why all of this hopping around...?
Instructions : Because, we don’t want ANYBODY to EVER suspect who would ever build such a sinister monopoly.
Queen        : Alright, fine. 
               *a few days later, the Queen assembles the 13 compartments each in reverse order...
Queen        : Alright, I’m BACK now, buddy.
Instructions : Excellent.
               The last order of business...?
               You will need an adolescent OR adult virgin to sacrifice to the gods...
               Then every order of business will be complete.
Queen        : WELL HOLY SHIT BUDDY.
               WHERE WILL I EVER FIND ONE OF THOSE...? 
               OH NO, WHAT EVER WILL I DO.

I gotta give the queen SOME credit for putting up with so many complicated instructions, and doing everything 
on her end, patiently as could be. Because if there’s something to respect about the British Monarchy...? 
They are definitely very sophisticated, and very patient. 

If the queen had successfully followed the 13 compartments worth of instructions...? 
She may have actually assembled the Triforce in a game of Zelda that a 16-year-old was having her build, 
INSTEAD of a huge corporation like Fox News/Exxon Mobil.

But she would never ALLOW herself to get into a such a ridiculous situation to begin with...
No. That’s how sophisticated people operate. 
She would TRULY BE VERY BESIDE herself, if she allowed herself to be fooled into just helping some kid 
assemble a Triforce in a Zelda game that whole time.

That’s why it’s not an efficient use of one’s time to MAIL instructions to somebody you’ve never met, and then 
expect that some other trustworthy party will walk across town to submit some mail that goes from one country 
to another, indirectly.

Because, while that would NEVER raise any eyebrows, nor would it ever be questioned... it would be IMPOSSIBLE
to know anyone was wasting their time OR if they were making mistakes...
Nope. Because that’s really fucking complicated.

You’re talking a hypothetical 13 compartments worth of letters that were mailed to person A, then person 
A had to copy the letter, walk across town, and mail it to person B, and then person B had to do the same 
thing... until eventually, person K finally sends the last envelope, fully assembled. 

Now EVERYBODY’s fucked... because Person K was basically the ace in the hole that entire time.
Nobody would ever know that Person K was actually the main guy behind the scenes, involving himself in the 
copying and transmission of the sacred Death Star plans...

And now, the queen was able to be sent the final piece of the puzzle... Because there’s no way the queen would 
ever involve herself with such a convoluted game of chutes, packages, and ladders, not without knowing that she 
wasn’t wasting her own time... Nah. There’s plenty of good things to say about the British Monarchy, they truly
are very sophisticated about everything they do. Except when it’s Prince Andrew lying about Ms. Guiffre.

Other than that though...? Very complex people, very sophisticated, worthy of great respect... they know how 
10 dimensional chess is played... and they’re not the easiest foe anyone has ever faced in history. Ohhhh no.

Now the example I’d just provided in reference to the queen...? 
That is rather ridiculous. 
However, there is something even MORE sinister, about the true arrangement.

The entry “What Clifton Park should COLLECTIVELY be doing”, makes PERFECT SENSE, and that is UNTAPPED REVENUE. 

While the same person does not own 1) Spectrum, 2) Comcast, 3) Cox, 4) Verizon...? 
They each SHARE the SAME AGENDA, and they’re SHARING access to the SAME LINES. 
Someone is making a LOT of money off of provisioning access to those lines to other contractors, 
and that is basically EXTORTION.

PABLO ESCOBAR became the filthiest stinkin’ rich person in all of history... WELL beyond ROCKEFELLER, CARNEGIE, 
and the current billionaires. His Columbian Drug Cartel handled (business/affairs) with the United States, and 
the middlemen because the cartel was supplying cocaine to the United States, whereby causing an epidemic.

The middle men that deal drugs commonly "cut" their product down in order to increase profits, though these guys 
rarely had any reason to do just that. 

VERIZON and SPECTRUM are LITERALLY doing the SAME EXACT THING in NEW YORK... 
They’re taking an EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT/SERVICE, having SPECTRUM take a massive shit where they just 
wipe their ass with their bare hand, right...? THEN, SPECTRUM doesn’t WASH their fuckin hand or anything, they 
just go ahead and get themselves involved in touching ALL OF THE DATA AND CONNECTION ASPECTS between VERIZON, 
and the CUSTOMER. Then, both their SHIT (from their hand that they didn’t wash) as well as their service, is 
provided to the end users. This is not LITERALLY what they’re doing, but it is a PERFECT METAPHOR.

Now, if these companies I rattled off were TRUE competition...? 
Then, CHOPPING THOSE PARTICULAR LINES wouldn’t cause a total internet blackout in upstate New York. Nah. 
Usually, if a particular person were to take an AXE/HATCHET... 
...and they decided to swing it really hard, to break that (1) cable... 
...and then SUDDENLY NOBODY has internet or cell service for like 50 miles...

Well, that would be a dead indication that ALL of the communications in the region depended on that SINGLE LINE.
They can’t even lie about it at that point, because that would immediately meant that they were all working 
together as a MONOPOLY, or sharing access to a particular line.

Then, all of the people who thought they could/would get away with this charade may very well wind up in PRISON. 
"Big things start small." -Jeff Bezos  
It’ll start out with like the “little” people. 

People may begin to ask: “Why do these Verizon engineers keep landing themselves in prison for 10 years...?”
Well, it’ll be because people that were breaking the law were actually getting caught doing the same illegal 
shit they’ve been getting away with for many years because some people in New York State are fucking lazy...
...so the people that were supposed to INVESTIGATE and then ARREST those people for committing those crimes...?
...they had to have their badges taken away, permanently cause they were charged with multiple felonies. 
Michael Zurlo, SCSO Sheriff is one of those people by the way.

However, it would EVENTUALLY wind up being an entire LIST of MILLIONAIRES and perhaps BILLIONAIRES who had 
their ASSETS FROZEN... 

The ones that weren’t getting rich or STAYING rich off of this ridiculous idea...? 
THEY never had anything to worry about... because they had MORALS that whole time. 
They’re fuckin’ awesome at everything they do, why would they need to do something mad shady...
...to get or stay rich...? Ya know...?

But the ones that WERE doing dirty shit that whole time...? They’re... gonna start sweating fuckin’ bullets.
Because they had never had to worry about being arrested for committing a single crime in their entire life.
Anytime they committed a serious crime...? They were just way too important to ever be CHARGED with a CRIME.
That’s mainly because some of the POLICE OFFICERS, FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS, JUDGES, and PUBLIC SERVANTS had to
be TRICKED and ENSNARED in a very large, HIGHLY MANIPULATIVE sting operation where suddenly half of the people
in a public office in New York State...? They all got charged with RICO charges at the same exact time.

Basically every single one of them will get to look forward to no less than 10 years in prison.

I really hate to say this, but- a lot of people really aren’t very bright around here. 
I don’t think that’s everybody’s FAULT, that some people they seem to trust are PHENOMENALLY GIFTED at the 
holy sacred art, of being a LYING DOUCHEBAG. But- as good at lying as they are, someone has to be smarter 
than they are and catch them in the act. They needed to be pulled down a few pegs, not like 1 or 2 either, 
cause that’s moronic... I’m talkin’ like 10 fuckin’ pegs.

I really like when I talk to somebody that thinks that because someone has a lot of money, that means they’re 
untouchable. Well, of course, morons will think that, won’t they...? Those people will take advantage of people 
who think MONEY is basically a license for that person to do whatever the fuck they want to. But that’s why they
should really consider the story of Jordan Belfort, “The Wolf Of Wall Street”. 

Basically, this dude was at the top of WALL STREET until (1) very incredibly persistent, and patient FBI man 
managed to take out an entire slew of crooked wall street executives that had BILLIONS of dollars in their
possession. This (1) man was able to take away 100% of all that shit. 
(^ That’s some Theodore Roosevelt shit right there.)

You would be amazed as to how effective (1) fuckin’ guy with a determined strategy to make a lot of people 
look like fools, works. I mean, everybody should also take a look at Elon Musk... Basically his entire life 
story is like, trying to be the helpful good guy and benefit all of mankind, while dudes like Bob Lutz shit 
his pants every day and short-sell Tesla Motors stock.

Anyway, Theodore Roosevelt was a president who performed this process where he literally punched people in the 
face if they didn’t return his letters. You gotta be willing to tell people that these fucks WILL LIE TO EVERYONE,
and it is NOT LEGAL FOR THEM TO DO THIS SHIT.

Now, suppose if Town of Clifton Park Justice James Hughes issued an order...
This one dude alone might be the closest thing to Teddy Roosevelt if I’ll be honest...
They may very well make up their minds, practically immediately... 

If at any moment, the most important person in the town of Clifton Park decided to provide an order, for someone
to take a hatchet and start cutting every internet backbone cable they can find. 

Doing that is illegal. However, if the CORRECT PEOPLE strategically decide to DO such a thing, then nobody 
will actually get in trouble. 

The way to do this LEGALLY, would be to convince Town of Clifton Park Justice James Hughes, who’s been the 
end all, be all, of local town justice, for 35-40 years...
...a man who puts his own damn shoes on...
...and uses his own damn feet and legs...
...to walk a beat around his own damn town, every morning... 
...he does this cause he’ll be damned if anybody’s gonna call HIM a lazy son of a bitch...
...nah, this dude isn’t like Lester Wormuth or Robert Rybak... 
You do somethin’ to piss James Hughes off...? Heh. Well, lets put it this way...

He will cause innocent people to feel as if they obviously must’ve done SOMETHING wrong... 
...cause now the most important man in town has to talk some sense into somebody.
That’s Town Justice, James Hughes for ya.

Anyway, I’d imagine that Judge Hughes would get pretty pissed off if he found out that there were some hidden 
fees going on that whole time that HE could’ve been taking advantage of for the town. But, people were lying 
to this mans face, and calling that “business as usual”. I think Judge Hughes just needs some assistance in 
being shown when certain people lie to him. Because, that’s gonna piss him off. He’s gonna realize that he 
trusted some people that just casually lied to this dude over and over... and then he’s gonna lose his cool.

If I had to put Town Justice JAMES HUGHES into an analogy...?

He is like a guy that could easily tell MICHAEL ZURLO what a lazy cocksucker he is... right...?
But the only reason he does NOT do such a thing, is because JAMES HUGHES does not like the idea of being
seen as somebody who even OCCASIONALLY swears... Even if it is called for...? 
JAMES HUGHES doesn’t fuck around, nor swear without catching himself FIRST.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Hughes : MICHAEL ZURLO, I’m gonna tell ya somethin’ ya lazy *catches himself*...
         *sighs* LOOK pal, this dude right here has been a resident of my town for...
         *checks watch* 35 years, bub.
Zurlo  : He’s a friggen madman dude.
         I swear, the guy literally tries to toss himself entire football fields...
         ...lunging’ at some of my guys.
         I really do not see this individual being a respectable citizen by any standard...
Hughes : The dude literally walks around the whole entire town, dude.
         YOU don’t even do that.
Zurlo  : Yeah, yeah... 
         Look JAMES...
Hughes : You don’t call me JAMES, buddy.
         I’m Town of Clifton Park JUSTICE HUGHES...
         *points* This dude right here...?
         He knows where they make the best pizza in this town.
         AND, dude literally writes everything himself. 
         ...does his OWN work, too.
         And, I have literally seen the kid posting door to door, flyers.
Zurlo  : Yeah, he called SOME guys at the FBI cocksuckers, dude...
Hughes : Yeah...?
         So what...?
Zurlo  : That’s- uncalled for.
Hughes : Not if they tried to kill him, and you helped them do it.
         Dude obviously has some respect for Christopher 1) Wray and 2) Voss.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Verizon is the best in the industry, but somehow...? Oh man, FIOS isn’t here in town yet...? Huh. 

MAYBE... it WILL be, if some KEY IMPORTANT PERSON were to LIGHT A FIRE UNDER THEIR ASS, and somehow have 
broadband competition. 

Wouldn’t be ILLEGAL if Judge Hughes provides that COMMAND, to disconnect those fiber optic lines right 
next to Snyders. Now, the feds will probably send people to arrest somebody...? 
...but that SOMEBODY will have to answer to a guy that’s been the fucking town justice for 35-40 years. 
Nobody’s takin’ that dude to jail. 

What that dude says...? In his fuckin’ town...? Goes. So, if he says “All of em, cut every single one.”
...you can bet your ass that the Militia might have to be there.

Not to mention, this whole entire case here, is ALREADY going to expose the OTHER crimes that SOME of the
feds are already committing, such as being a Racketeer Influenced Criminal Organization, using cyberattacks,
exploits, and committing identity theft and cybercrime... cause then they will realize that the game is over.

I’m not ready to say that entire organizations or agencies are all conspiring, and that everybody in all of 
Them, is an evil henchmen... Not saying that at all. But, it is pretty fuckin’ obvious that there’s a link or 
correlation between → Verizon, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Communications Commission 

Somehow nobody saw that they were owned by the same private entity. 
They’re ALL makin’ mad cheddar off of stolen intellectual property that a GENIUS named Nikola Tesla, INVENTED. 
That GENIUS, invented (AC Electricity) AND (Wireless radio). 

Wanna know how RICH that genius WOULD’VE been, if these fucks didn’t like CENSOR THE SHIT OUT OF HIM...?

MORE RICH THAN ROCKEFELLER EVER WAS. 
Unfortunately, that’s not what happened for Nikola Tesla, because of a cocksucker named Thomas Edison. 
General Electric, Thomas Edison.
A man that told a lot of people that he in fact, invented the light bulb...?
but that’s a total crock of shit because some other dude did 2 weeks prior to Edison’s first success.
Thomas Edison, DID NOT INVENT THE LIGHT BULB.

Yeah, here’s the bottom line, [it’s ok if some people commit treason*], they got away with it.  (*REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY)
Even if you can prove that they did that, oh well. 
But, if you even think about taking a hatchet to any internet backbone cable, that’s gonna piss people off.

They spliced these two videos together where I was walking down Main St. and said “Our dreams are our ability 
to see time backwards.” So, what they don’t seem to get is that they cause me to feel as if I am onto something 
every time they try to be slick.

My phone was just about dead, and my ass cheeks were rather chafed up from the sweat... FYI when you’re a dude,
dude’s have ass hair. So, when it’s warm outside, and you’re walking for miles and miles, eventually all that 
walking causes the sweat and ass hairs to sorta grind up against your ass cheeks... and it fuckin hurts pretty 
bad after a while. 

Probably being a bit too honest by saying that, but man... my feet were not feeling all that swell either. 
Thought it was time to fuckin’ hobble along back home, upload a bunch of pictures, files, and get some fuckin’ 
sleep. 

I planned on doing the south side of town the next day.

Heard the bird right next to Feiden Appliance Center at the rear gate to Halfmoon Heights on Biette Road. 
I noticed the camper in the yard of the house NEAREST that particular gate. I think people were in there. 
Not at that moment, but maybe later on. Something about this area kept drawing me back to it... 
I went home and passed out.

They try to hide something, and they’re blatant about it. Almost like they have a dick they’re sucking on, and 
they don’t want ANYBODY to see it... but- when they splice 2 fuckin’ videos together, there’s an obvious dick in 
the mouth right there... the video was 1) spliced together and 2) corrupted. 

Then I looked at the other versions of the files and the cool thing is that (2) videos with the same content 
have differing file sizes, which means that the videos have something transcoded in them.

One thing you wanna keep in mind when you’re doing something most people would never think/do in my situation, 
is just to keep applying pressure. Because the LAST thing ANY serial killer really wants, is to be caught on 
camera looking like they’re about to stab somebody... But, maybe they’ll try again. You know? I mean, so what 
if they get me? Oh well. Fuckin’ tried.

In all seriousness, it’s easy to allow negativity to surface and cloud your judgment. 
The real challenge, is to catch the serial killer, and then bang his girlfriend AFTER that. Tell her:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me  : Hey. Your fuckin’ pencildick serial killer boyfriend got caught.
Her : Oh nos.
Me  : Sad...?
Her : Very. 
Me  : Tears...?
Her : Meh.
Me  : Well, how would you like to be fucked, anyway...?
Her : I was just thinking about asking you that, actually. 
      ...cause I have never orgasmed ONE TIME with that dude the entire 20 years we had a “relationship”...
Me  : Oh, wow...
      20 fuckin’ years, eh?
Her : Yeah. 
      I mean... 
      ...it’d only make sense, since my pencildick serial killer boyfriend got caught...
      ...I don’t have anything else planned.
      You telling me he’s in jail now kinda makes me horny.
Me  : Alright, how you wanna do this then...?
Her : Well, can I suck your dick first...? 
Me  : Of course you can.
Her : *immediately unzips my pants and reaches in...*
Her : WOOOOOW YOU have quite a fuckin’ big fat one bro...
Me  : Well, it’s not something I would ever think to use as a WRITING UTENSIL...
Her : No, yeah, it’s cool bro. *looks a little scared actually*
      This thing might be WAAY too big for me.
      I’m scared to let ya tear it up...

She’s probably gonna be SO sad, that instead of tears running down her face... might be somethin’ else.
I’m rubbing it in for a reason... somebody had a fuckin’ field day for years, until they got caught. Oh nos.
Anyway, look. Let’s not jump to conclusions cause I haven’t caught the son of a bitch yet...

When I reviewed the footage from that day AFTER I did so, no more was it clear to me that I 
was being tailed by SERIAL KILLERS for like, most of the fuckin’ night. AND, these fucks were causing disruption 
to my iPhone when I attempted to exfiltrate many pictures, videos and other various files and evidence from it. 
    
When I was near the Orenda Exercise trail, oh, I fuckin’ heard somebody in the woods alright... 
That’s why I took my time walking around behind Skano Elementary, stating “The Uncanny Valley”. 

Look at it this way... not a lot of people know how to write like I can. 
I write a lot because it seems to make a lot more sense than wasting my breath on people that write me off. 
There are varying reasons why people do that, however. 
Some of those reasons are more sinister than others.
I KNEW some fuckin’ moron was in that trail there. 
THEN, oh check it out- now I have a video of this prick getting on his bicycle, with a neon light thing on it.

Trying to look inconspicuous, failing. Look, even if you do manage to insult somebody that deserves to be 
insulted, they’re still not gonna care. They just probably will never get it. Hm. 

Then, check it out... when I recorded the video in front of the Jonesville fire station, I mention that the
kid who was across the street that I like recorded for a second in that video... He was watching the “stream”.
When I said “stream”, what I meant was that I knew that this program was already deployed to my device....
Ya know? Maybe I could say it more explicitly, “Hey, any serial killers that are listenin’... I know that you 
fucks are listenin’ and watchin’ my stream...” 

Maybe that’s why the video blurs in the one spot... But whatever man.
People will probably not understand just what that means. 
Even if you provide definitions, and interesting stories.

In the video, the blurriness of the camera hides/masquerades the plate number and make/model of the vehicle,
and this particular video JUST SO HAPPENS TO PASS AT THAT PERFECT MOMENT... and then, fucks off. Bye-bye.

However, THAT VEHICLE MAKES AN APPEARANCE IN ANOTHER VIDEO... which basically UNDERMINES that whole stunt.
If anything, the people that thought to do that...? They’re fuckin’ ABSOLUTE morons. Retarded individuals.

It’s like “HERE, WE NEED TO ERASE A MISTAKE” and then, they erase it, and when they do, the thing they erased
is still clearly visible... | ← FBI people, not morons at all. But... this is Michael C. fuckin’ Cook we’re 
talkin’ about, believe it or not. That means FBI people, are consistently outmatched*. Practically effortless.
Just gonna keep twisting the knife throughout this entire document, cause they know how bad the situation is.

One of the dead giveaways that I was able to determine, was that they merged 2 different files into one on 
my server. So, I went to review the footage and somehow [two different fuckin’ videos got spliced together*] 
and it made me feel as if I should [review the content I had recorded AGAIN], and boy oh boy am I a lot smarter 
than [these] people... They don’t get it. When I see duplicate photos or videos or spliced videos that have 
gotten corrupted, OR, software failing to upload my files, it’s a CLUE when it fails.

By the way, I have video of someone causing interference to my device while I had it plugged into my laptop.
An Asus Q504UA Laptop with a UEFI/BIOS exploit that deploys PERSISTENT MALWARE, v301. 

And then your standard-issue Apple iPhone 8+ (with PEGASUS/PHANTOM deployed to it) that I’ve taken a lot of 
pictures with, and videos... and for some reason there’s an entire STATE full of people that don’t bother to 
look at any of these things. Weird. To me...? It’s almost as if I really need to twist the knife, and rub it
in, that “Hey, check out these criminal activities that the police did...” 

People like my mother, or family, they just wave it off like what I’m saying fuckin’ matters... 
All the while, it DID matter, and they just didn’t give a flying fuck about my fathers’ murder...
...being related in some way to ME almost being killed. So if I sound like I’m being quite condescending,
it’s literally because my father knew this shit was happening to him as well, before he was killed. 
Then, he was killed when I was a kid, and then I lived my whole life being totally oblivious to the notion
that the people who had my father killed...? They would one day do the same to me, and they nearly succeeded. 
    
Then when I try to say that to other people, they will laugh at me like my stepfather did, and tell me that 
I’m too pathetic of a human being for anybody to give a flying fuck about. Cool. Fuck you, dude.

That is EXACTLY what I’ve been saying, but, don’t mind me.
I realize, being a condescending dickhead isn’t exactly a great idea, but... asking for help is also not a 
great idea either, at least not DIRECTLY. Cause then someone will “help” by seeing me treading water in the 
ocean, and they will fuckin’ toss me a brick. 
 
Real helpful. There’s somewhere in the middle of those two things where I attempt to do THAT first...? 
But then I get waved off and told I must be delusional. So, that causes me to say shit where I have to 
aggressively manipulate people with any strategy I can think of, cause they’re not helpful.

Started to walk all the way down Route 9. These pictures are pretty important. 
I heard the BIRD earlier that morning when I finally got home from walking all around town the night before,
in a BUSH that’s across the street from the house CLOSEST to “Glass Road”.

So, that is where I started taking pictures. What is MOST important about these pictures, isn’t necessarily 
the CONTENT in the pictures, so much as reminding me WHY I took these pictures. The content is still pretty 
IMPORTANT after all. As I will explain...
    
Prior to (05/27/20) when JAMES LEONARD illegally filed 20-003173, and then had (MICHAEL MARTIN/DJ THOMPSON) 
illegally arrest me on (06/01/20), I had no idea who “Zackary Karel” was. Nor that this ARREST would reveal 
LEONARD’s involvement in the illegal cover up of the attempted murder. Normally, police officers aren’t 
supposed to ILLEGALLY arrest people, but in many instances, they can in fact pretend like they don’t see the
problem with their MORALITY or ETHICS, and therefore, that causes an entire community of people to have no 
idea that they trust people with badges who operate exactly like on the show “The Shield”.

I had been eyeing the 1769 Route 9 residence for some time, for reasons I will elaborate on, later. 
I took pictures of nearly every property adjacent to Asotoia Vucetic’s abandoned driving range property.

| This is adjacent to KENNETH YATES’ uncle’s property. It is DIRECTLY across street from 1769 US-9, Zack  |
| Karel’s “residence”. Maybe Zack DOES live there. However, Zack’s ‘HOUSE’ used to be a ‘DOCTORS OFFICE’. |

| [FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION FIELD OFFICE, 200 McCarty Ave, ALBANY NY]                              |
| I walked ALL the way back home, and around 6PM-8PM that same day, in the rear parking lot of this       |    
| building (1745 US-9), there was a group of people sitting in fold-up chairs.                            |
| [1 of em looked like the (2) guys that attacked me on (05/25/20 2343 → 05/26/0004)].                    |
|                                                                                                         |
| As soon as he saw me...? HE STOOD UP IMMEDIATELY AND WALKED TO THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING PRETTY QUICKLY. |
| ALMOST AS IF A GUY ASKED HIM “HEY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A DICK THROWN IN YOUR BUTT RIGHT NOW...?” and |
| that guy was like “FUCK YEAH I DO, DEFINITELY.”                                                         |
| That’s weird, right...? Doesn’t necessarily mean anything if a guy SUDDENLY SEES ME, IMMEDIATELY STANDS | 
| UP and then WALKS OUT OF SIGHT. Cause, everybody fuckin’ does that. There’s NOTHING SUSPICIOUS about    | 
| that at all.                             (← THERE’S DEFINITELY SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THAT BEHAVIOR)|

[1769 Route 9 – AKA Zackary Karels Residence] : I’d often walk past the house from 07/05/19 until, well... 
...still do sometimes. I saw a car sitting in the driveway for a very long time that hadn’t moved. I began 
to develop suspicions toward this house. The vehicle looked a lot like the Honda Civic that a girl who used 
to work at Cusato’s drove, can’t remember her name, but Betsy Feiden worked there as well.

[MR. YATES]: I later worked on his computer in April 2021 that he brought to COMPUTER ANSWERS for service. 
I believe I actually worked on this device a VERY LONG TIME ago, and BRANDON DIBBLE sold it to him. Not 
positive about that. At the time I took this picture, I was actually concerned that this dude was missing 
or killed. Because his vehicle hadn’t moved for like a couple weeks, neither did his blinds. Pretty sure 
that the garbage can actually was the reason why I thought that. Pretty sure that thing hadn’t moved for 
a while either. However, he’s fine.

[DENNIS YATES SR.]: married to [CAROL YATES (his widow)], owned the [BUSINESS PRODUCTS COMPANY] for many years. 
Ken told me they used to live/run their business [BUSINESS PRODUCTS COMPANY] near [WOODBURYS/BENSONS], or next 
to the [FIRE STATION] on FIRE ROAD. They later moved to the location 1763 US-9, which is directly across the 
street from the [CLIFTON PARK POST OFFICE].  [DENNIS and CAROL] parents of: [DENNIS YATES JR.], [KENNETH YATES], 
and [DAVID YATES]. SR. is buried in the village cemetery off of Cemetery Road, near Tanski’s office, died of 
COVID in late 2019. 

[KENNETH YATES] - The END ALL, BE ALL, of printer repair techs that could literally drop kick 100% of every 
employee that ever worked at NFRASTRUCTURE, who THOUGHT they might’ve had some serious skill at repairing 
printers... at repairing printers, hands down... this dude will show everyone the literal DOOR, at this task.

This dude is BEYOND LEXMARK CERTIFIED. Not even remotely kidding. Probably bottle fed many of the people who
grew up to come up with the idea, of creating things like LEXMARK CERTIFICATIONS. Dude even smokes MICHAEL
CHICCINELLI down in WATERFORD @ UNIVERSAL PRINTING on his best day. Dude could LITERALLY roll out of bed, and 
completely tear apart AND rebuild, or fix a printer... LONG before DWAYNE COONRADT had a chance to lie to his 
first customer, any given day of the week. 

SO... I hope I’m doing a decent job in describing how much this fuckin’ dude knows, about repairing printers.  
This dude’s dad DENNIS YATES SR., fuckin’ taught these dudes everything they know. 
What did I learn from KENNETH YATES...? That he knows what the fuck he’s doin’. End of the conversation...

[DAVID YATES]: Left the business he was running with KENNETH YATES, to be a teacher at SUNY or something.
I don’t think I ever met this guy, nor [DENNIS YATES JR.].

[BUSINESS PRODUCTS COMPANY]: I later worked with KENNETH YATES. Felt like a great opportunity to capitalize 
on. I WAS looking to help Ken with his business, as well as mine. and cleaned about 80% of his basement, 
full of:

I was keeping track of how many times his court was making very obvious and careless mistakes with ALL of my 
court appearances, and my public defender SARAH SCHELLINGER, was quite a fuckin’ useless lawyer. Not helpful.
Anti-helpful, actually. Then, after I FIRED Sarah for being a lousy lawyer, and never calling me back, nor
emailing me after I told her “Hey, check out some of this fuckin’ evidence...” 

WELL, apparently she didn’t get the memo and decided it would be okay, to transfer my case that she WAS NO 
LONGER INVOLVED IN, to JOHN DELONG. I did actually tell SARAH SCHELLINGER, that I was working at this address.
Amazingly, maybe she should be a MIME instead of a LAWYER. 
By the way, MIME’S are CLOWNS that DON’T SAY WORDS TO PEOPLE, perfect definition of her.
Unfortunately, SARAH SCHELLINGER sorta CLUED ME IN one day...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

SCHELLINGER : OH HOWCOME YOU’RE POSTING STUFF ON SOCIAL MEDIA...?
              I’M NOT SUPPOSED TO EVEN KNOW THAT YOU’RE DOING THAT... BUT SOMEHOW I DO.
              ANYWAY, I JUST SO HAPPENED TO HAVE GOTTEN THE LETTER THAT JUDGE PELAGALLI MADE A DECISION...
              ...FOR YOU TO SPEND (20) DAYS AT THE COUNTY JAIL.
              YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TURN YOURSELF INTO THE JAIL.
              I WAS JUST SO FUCKING BUSY IGNORING ALL THE SHIT YOU KEPT SENDING ME...
              THAT I JUST ASSUMED YOU HAD GOTTEN THE LETTER...
              THE COURT SHOULD’VE SENT YOU THAT LETTER, (I BELIEVE)...
Me          : Oh I was now, was I, cunt...? 
              Nah. 
              They never mailed me the order cuntface.
SCHELLINGER : YEP, THEY DEFINITELY SHOULD HAVE...
              SO...
              IDK WHAT TO TELL YA...
              BY THE WAY...
              YOU SHOULDN’T SAY MEAN WORDS LIKE THAT, EVEN IF I’M PROVIDING LESS THAN SATISFACTORY SERVICE...
Me          : Oh, ok, I’ll have to keep that in mind.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I even have an audio recording of Dennis Bruce telling me that his system even says that they mailed it... 
But, that man was lying to me.

As for [BUSINESS PRODUCTS COMPANY]...? Ken sorta had an issue understanding that I was working my ass off to 
get to that point where his company would be turning around a lot more business.

We had an arrangement where I would fix people’s computers, and I began working on RITA OLIVERIO’s laptop.
A Lenovo Yoga 3 or something. LENOVO has a history of making defective laptops. SOME OF THEM ARE GOOD, but
SOME of them: suck ass. The place he ordered it from sent a DEFECTIVE MOTHERBOARD. I asked him to send the 
motherboard back... because it was DEFECTIVE. 
_______________________________________________________________________
| AMAZON is really AWESOME at CONSTANTLY SENDING DEFECTIVE COMPONENTS |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
DWAYNE COONRADT, even with HIM basically being an overpaid crybaby that doesn’t really like to work that hard,
he’d NEVER AGREE that I run circles around him 100% of any given day that I ever worked with the guy... but he
WILL DEFINITELY AGREE, that AMAZON IS AWESOME, AT: CONSTANTLY SENDING DEFECTIVE COMPONENTS.

That is the MAIN REASON why I have such an issue with JEFF fuckin’ BEZOS. 
“OooOOOohhHHh, how am I supposed to know that our marketplace sold a defective motherboard...?”
Well, I don’t know, dickface. Maybe you should do some internal auditing of your own marketplace.

Look, Ken was a pretty cool guy to work with for a while. He’s got a subtle sense of humor that most people 
won’t actually catch in real time. Similar in some ways to Dwayne, but obviously Ken has a lot more MORALITY 
than Dwayne does, any day of the fuckin’ week. I know that people in this area, are relatively clueless. And...

...when I say clueless, what I mean is that they all judge people by their PERSONALITY, REPUTATION, or their 
APPEARANCE... which puts em in a VULNERABLE POSITION to be BAMBOOZLED when someone they RESPECT, lies to them.

Until they were to put PRINCIPLE OVER PERSONALITY, they will continue to believe when they’re lied to.
Someone IS telling them the truth, and it ISN’T the person or people they RESPECT, either. 
The person that IS telling them the truth, has been being written off, CONSISTENTLY.
That person being, me.

If Ken knew just how many people in this shit storm are involved...? 
MAYBE he’ll have second thoughts. But- maybe it wasn’t quite time.

[ASTOIA VUCETIC’s OLD HOUSE]: Maybe if the person in the RED CAR was doing something illegal, 
somebody would’ve arrested that dude by now, right...?                                                    (← FALLACY)

| [0012, 0013]: HALFMOON SANDWICH AND SUB SHOP - Now, these serial killers are probably gonna get pretty  | 
| hungry sometimes, so they will get some food HERE, quite often. They actually make VERY good food here. | 
| Still, they probably have no idea how often the serial killers come in, and order some. Sometimes they  | 
| might even feel like charming the girls at the cash register, and that’s when they think:               |
| SERIAL KILLERS: I kinda wanna pump this girl in the butt... she’s hot.                                  |

[CENTER FOR SECURITY]: They’ll basically pretend as if certain ANY evidence of a crime happening on their 
equipment, THEY didn’t see a crime at all... Nah. That’s the purpose of surveillance equipment, to be able 
to SEE criminal activities WHEN they OCCURRED, and then, if something strange happens...? 

Then you can literally rewind the footage, and then see what happened at or about that time. 

For a place that’s called CENTER FOR SECURITY, it really strikes me as ODD, that they wouldn’t really know
how to look back at their own footage. Ya know...? Maybe they need a LESSON, somebody that can show em
how to rewind the fuckin’ surveillance footage, that way they’ll know how to review their own footage for 
later. 

If you buy stuff from THESE guys, they can REMOTELY WIPE THAT FOOTAGE. WOW. They can also slim-jim their 
way into houses, and there’s just no BREAKING and ENTERING being performed. No way chum. Just a qualified, 
certified locksmith, no games being played, you can trust who you’re buying your locks/safes from.

MAYBE... they sell some of this stuff to: [Key Bank, 1703 Route 9, Clifton Park NY], and install security 
services like ADT. Then, they’ll make sure that they have back door access to let Justin Belleville waltz 
in at about 10PM after hours, like he did on June 16th, 2020... so that Justin Belleville can swap the 
contents of locked drawers from one drawer to another. It’ll look like Peter Amato, or Nicholas Dinova 
actually did that shit... but no.

They just expect people to believe that these guys, found a fuckin’ way into the LOCKED BANK when Justin 
Belleville (who like NOTARIZES STUFF BY THE WAY...) JUST SO HAPPENED TO HAVE A RED ACURA 4 DOOR SEDAN 
PARKED OUT FRONT. The COOL thing is, a guy from SCSO drove up to me about 7 minutes later on that date... 
in vehicle [4184*] (← Definitely the plate number). Fake cop car, tried to fake me out when I was standing 
in front of the Phoenix building. Weird.

Anyway... These guys are dangerous, and I’ll elaborate more on that shortly.

[AMBIENCE]: Nicole Clarke, I’m not certain if that’s my friend Doug Bagely’s mother, or not. 
But I know that SHE happens to be very good friends with Mr. Bruce “ol’ Batman” Tanski. 

The story of this man who went from RAGS to RICHES, it involves a lot of interesting parallels where many 
of the people I’ve grown up with that did plenty of construction, many of them went on to become millionaires. 

And that’s fine, nothin’ wrong with that. But- Tanski has been at the heart/center of so many other success 
stories. I’m not jumping to any conclusions, I’m simply making PARALLEL OBSERVATIONS because these details 
are about to become incredibly important.

I didn’t think anything was happening here, but I have to CONSIDER it, and keep it in the back of my mind, 
as a potential POSSIBILITY. (← what the police are supposed to do)
   
\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

[WILLSCOT]: I once worked with a guy named Paul Daniels when I managed Computer Answers. Paul Daniels was a 
pretty cool dude to work with, and in August 2017 when him and Dana King had helped the store achieve `$42K 
in sales...? I made damn certain that these guys got a fuckin’ bonus. 

Anyway, Paul worked at a place called Mannheim during the day, and Computer Answers at night.
Now, if it weren’t for some guy that looks nearly IDENTICAL to Paul Daniels, that I constantly thought 
“Hey, is that Paul right there drivin...? Oh, nah. It isn’t. My bad.”
...driving multiple vehicles...
Well, I probably would not remember the multiple instances I saw this doppelganger of his.

Nor the color/make/model of the vehicles he would drive. 
For instance (1): a WHITE HONDA S2000 CONVERTIBLE on May 7th, 2020 around 10PM near Aldi... 
        
    (Side point) I was writing something about Nelson Bighetti from the show “Silicon Valley”. 
    Nelson Bigetti is a dude who ACCIDENTALLY gets lucky ALL the time, in a way that isn’t very 
    realistic. It’s why I thought to write the skit, actually. (End side point)

Or, instance (2): on my birthday driving a WHITE CADILLAC SUV, blasting outta Willscot.

He was in a massive hurry for some reason, though I cannot specify with any certainty at all, that he was 
digging ANYTHING. But- I wouldn’t have thought to go check out the area there, if I wasn’t left with some  
“that was very fucking strange” impression. Nah, I don’t typically think “Wow, lets take pictures of this 
area. Maybe some shit’s goin’ down back there.9

So, I looked around. I wanted to know what that dude was in a mad rush for... so, I saw this wooded area
adjacent to Twin Lakes. I have previously walked through these woods beforehand, but this was the first 
time that I saw this massive area where, apparently, somebody was either DIGGING there, OR, had a bunch of 
rocks and gravel dropped into a hole that got dug. Didn’t see any turkey vultures or anything, so I may 
have been looking TOO closely.  

Still, for some key reason I didn’t quite understand. 

I believe that this guy I saw, works at Mannheim, where vehicles get repossessed/impounded/auctioned off,
as it would explain the numerous vehicles I’ve seen this doppelganger driving around. 
MAYBE some of those cars were actually heinous murders that never got solved.

I believe that they are probably used in some cases, to put someone’s dead body into, that way it can rot 
a little bit, and then the car will smell GOD AWFUL, cause that’s what PAUL DANIELS used to tell me 
“Man, some of these fuckin’ cars SMELL AWFUL.”               (← POTENTIALLY INDICATIVE OF HUMAN CORPSE DECOMPOSITION)

Well, I would’ve thought NOTHING about how I saw him aggressively drive right up to the stop sign, and 
then I waved at him and his DEMEANOR was pretty EVASIVE...~! 

Anyway, let’s not get ahead of ourselves here, BUT- I BELIEVE, that maybe there’s a THEME or a PATTERN here. 
Might’ve just been a TOTAL coincidence, that he just LOOKED like he may have been coming out of the woods. 
Not because he was digging something, nor disposing of a dead body... maybe he was just taking a piss or 
somethin’. Maybe he had piss running down his leg and he didn’t want me to see that. I don’t blame him, I 
wouldn’t want anybody to see me having piss run down my leg either, nor allow them to see that I already 
did... and that would actually explain the behavior I was seeing. 

Dude drives a WHITE CADILLAC SUV, he’s too high class to ever consider carting around dead bodies in that 
thing, so, nobody who owns a CADILLAC SUV is ever gonna consider that idea.                         (← FALLACY ALERT)

I had to pin that in memory and move on.
________________________________________________________________
| Theory of quite an evil scheme, but unraveled and associated |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
So, lets recap this theory...
- Serial killers that never get caught
- stalking targets with tools such as PEGASUS/PHANTOM
- committing [home invasions] where people get (raped THEN murdered/murdered in their sleep, “raped” afterward)
- no trace of a B&E                                                        (← Center for Security, bro)
- security systems disabled remotely                                       (← Center for Security, bro)
- security footage erased                                                  (← Center for Security, bro)
- safes sold to targets have a lot of MONEY, VALUABLES, DEEDS, WILLS, ETC. (← Center for Security, bro)
- victim thrown into their own car                                         (← Serial Killers/Center for Security)
- have that thing towed to Mannheim
- the “preundertaker” puts em in a trailer at Willscot
- then they drive that thing to places like Catricala Funeral Home, to give some of those bodies lil touch up
- MAYBE some of the bodies get turned into Sod Farm mulch... 
- MAYBE some of them are actually left behind for the police like MICHAEL ZURLO to “stumble” across
- the car(s) (is/are) CLEANED, and SOLD 
- the money gets thrown into someone’s bank account, 
- the land AND the house is cleaned out
- the land AND/OR house is SOLD to somebody
- could be Berkshire Hathaway...

Now, MICHAEL ZURLO would probably get real pissed if he kept “stumbling” across a lot of dead bodies repeatedly.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Zurlo : WHOA, a dead body...? 
        I’m MICHAEL ZURLO...?
        Oh man, this is NOT GOOD. 
        Looks like someone SUPPOSEDLY got killed, huh...? 
        Time to investigate the scene of a crime that wasn’t reported... 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

But- the whole entire scheme here is that the scene of the crime is never even known about, it just all occurs
under the radar, like friggen clockwork. Body in...? Body out. Sometimes groups of bodies, or fields of them.
Maybe even leech fields. Or sod farm fields.
    
Or it could just be some random innocent person that never even knew they were sold land where the previous 
owners were killed in their sleep. Hm.

Anyway, *hands wavin’ around* lets just assume that all of that shit is total bullshit. 
Can’t have people freak the fuck out from a very REALISTIC SCENARIO... 
...because you need another COMPELLING COMPONENT or two.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

[HALFMOON SANDWICH AND SUB SHOP]: Ya know, ordering good is about the only NORMAL thing these serial killers 
do. Because, no one has EVER caught these fucks. Not once. Because, even after they’d been caught...? Ah man, 
time to have Center for Security disable the security system, and then pick the lock, and then slice that 
person’s throat... they died. Gotta do the whole “Dexter” shit too. OR, they can just carry that asshole 
out to his own car. And let them rot in their own fuckin’ vehicle until that person gets behind on their
car payments... Uh-oh. Then the tow truck driver comes along and “repossesses” a car while the body is 
still decomposing in the trunk. 

Hm. That means that they can literally decompose for quite some time. Might even feel like there’s really 
no fucking way anyone will ever catch onto the whole entire game they’re playing together. And so, they 
will literally install Verizon FIOS right in plain view, for the whole world to see... cause everybody’s 
a total fuckin’ moron.

The interesting part is, I did work for the Halfmoon Sandwich and Sub Shop back in 2018 on behalf of 
Computer Answers, and helped them with their cable modem since the thing wasn’t workin’ correctly. But, 
since I’m such a degenerate piece of shit, there’s NO WAY that I would be smart enough to catch onto 
this, is there...? Well... some people literally think that I won’t catch onto this entire charade being
related. 

Whether Verizon would be involved in the Athletic building getting FIOS...? It’s an absolute CERTAINTY. 
And, that lady at the Sub Shop that I used to deliver the Metroland newspaper to WAY BACK before they 
DEMOLISHED it, and then REBUILT the place...? There’s no way that she would know that she would probably 
benefit from getting a MUCH lower price for the way faster internet that they get next door...right? 

Cause she could save SO MUCH FUCKING MONEY BY DOING THAT IF SHE DID.
Or, how about when you have DirectTV, and you go to call them for technical support, but the last number
is dialed incorrectly, so you actually get Spectrum tech support instead of DirectTV support... well.
Maybe that’s ALSO a fuckin’ coincidence too. There’s no way that those (2) companies are owned by the 
same person, is there...? Hm. Who owns Spectrum anyway...? Is it Ted Turner...? Or is it Warren Buffett...?
Does Warren Buffett own 1) Berkshire Hathaway, 2) Verizon, 3) AT&T, 4) Charter Communications, 5) etc...?

You would have to be the dumbest fuckin’ person on the god damn planet, to think that all of this shit is 
coincidental. LUCKILY, for Warren Buffett, I really don’t think that he is that involved in all this shit.
I’m not saying I don’t believe he isn’t, nor that he is, but rather, there’s something else going on.

That infraction just laying there on the ground like that...?
There’s no possible way that anyone could notice something that illegal, nor spend an entire several days
walking around collecting “evidence” like Trooper Carter should consider doing once he decides to start 
doing real work like a cop is supposed to fucking do... right...?

Literally impossible... cause if that was goin’ on, surely somebody would’ve done something by now, right?
Well, think again, ya fucks. That’s like 2 or 3 fallacious statements right there, COMBINED.
That’s like a fuckin’ megafallacy.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(5,"Excerpt [~] Now that’s what I call ‘Alliteration’",@"
Nah. I’m not calling the people at the sub shop stupid fucks, nor the readers. 
I’m calling the morons at Verizon... 
...who drive, float, and fuck around, in their fuckin’ federal phallus faceted fuckmobiles...
...cause these federal fuckfaced bastard fucks that fuckin’ frolic around in their fuckin’ underwear...
...they get fondled, filled AND fucked even more, by fifty filthy ass fuckstains...
...and this whole fuckin’ fiasco, in finality, is called Verizon fuckin’ FIOS... 
They’re the REAL motherfuckin’ fucks.
Now, that’s what I call “alliteration”.

Verizon, here’s a brand new award from JD Powers and Associates, for being such a consistently above average
service provider that can somehow stick their nose in everybody’s business, but if people ever ask:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

People  : Hey- why is FIOS not available yet...?
Verizon : We get awards from JD Powers and Associates for being the best in the industry.
People  : ...that doesn’t answer my question...
Verizon : Suck a fuckin’ dick, bro.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(5,"Before Catricala [|] (05/24/20 1845) (2)",@"
BEHIND them, the Athletic business gets Verizon FIOS, undetected... by morons. 
I mean, nobody would ever notice something that OBVIOUS, or fuckin’ blatant... would they...? 
If Gus Fring can distribute methamphetamines in fast food chicken trucks, surely Verizon can get away with 
waving their dicks around aimlessly, and pretend like they won’t actually be seen, providing a FIBER OPTIC 
CABLE and a SPLITTER, to certain places... right?

So like, Red Roof Inn. They get FIOS. Zappone. They get FIOS. Target gets FIOS. Pharmacies get FIOS.
Wanna know who fuckin’ doesn’t get FIOS though...? Most people in Clifton Park. 
Why is that...? Morons, everywhere you look, when you’re like me. Literally, everywhere you look, 
there’s a moron that believes every lie they’re told, there’s another one, and another... I gotta say, I 
have to stop myself, tell myself, “They’re not all morons or retards at all.” Because the solution is this...

The militia needs to be formed, and start going around catching these people in the act.

Haven’t met a single person who was ever intelligent enough to 1) take pictures of INFRACTIONS all around 
town, because that fuckin’ JD Powers and Associates award that Verizon seems to get every fuckin’ year for 
being the best in the industry...? Maybe, they allowed SOME people to get FIOS, and not everybody. 
So certain people get FIOS, but- not everybody. Some people get the way better internet, the rest of em get 
the shit service.

But anyway, Shenendehowa... Hm. Oliver Robinson...? No way bro. He is WAY TOO NICE to be involved in 
something shady like that. Nah. Not this guy. I’m being serious, based on the many times I’ve seen this man, 
I do not think he has a fucking CLUE, how 100% accurate my theory is. Nobody else does, either. 

Look, Verizon, has the best service around for a reason. It’s not actually sold to people in Clifton Park 
for a MUCH MORE SINISTER REASON than people think. Now, what could that sinister reason be...? Well, you 
have to be a part of the “whos who and what’s what”, to be in the special category of people that aren’t
really as intelligent as I am, who will gladly try to get away with all this shit that the Feds and FBI, 
Verizon, FCC, are doing to people... Exploiting Nikola Tesla’s fuckin’ work, and then being this hidden 
government where they don’t investigate a fuckin’ thing at all... They basically think they’re royalty.

I mean, I really hope I’m wrong about that and this is just a LOCALIZED THING THAT I DETECTED.
However... I’ve got something else to really sew it all together.

$Book.AddSection(5,"Catricala [|] (05/24/20 1910) (1)",@"
I was walking up Route 9, when suddenly, I see someone that looks like the dude in the convertible with 
his wife several days beforehand, pull up to the funeral home across the street from Computer Answers in a 
black, Lexus (I think). I decide to approach him, he was inside. As soon as he came to the door, he and I 
had a rather short conversation where he didn’t seem threatening or even really aware of what I suspected 
him of doing. I had seen this guy before, but I wasn’t sure where... and I didn’t know he was a State 
Assemblyman, either. Nor that Dave Feiden was also a local representative, and these two knew each other.

At the time, I didn’t think much of Eric Catricala being involved or related or anything in particular.
Didn’t even know his name. I had a gut feeling that maybe I oughtta talk to the dude when I saw him pull up.

$Book.AddSection(5,"Flashback [!] Eric Catricala",@"
Catricala : How can I help you...?
Me        : Hi, my name is Michael Cook. 
Catricala : Hello Michael, I’m Eric Catricala.
Me        : Nice to meet you. 
            Look, I was just passing by and thought I’d ask you a couple questions.
            Do you have a moment...?
Catricala : Sure.
Me        : Do you still do business with Computer Answers...?
Catricala : Every once in a while, but it’s been quite some time since I last went there.
Me        : Yeah, well... be wary of bringing your equipment for them to service.
Catricala : Oh yeah...? 
            Why’s that...?
Me        : Well, I used to manage that shop, I left behind the highest sales records at that place...
            ...and they do some incredibly questionable shit there.
Catricala : Like what...?
Me        : They steal software, and then they charge full price for stolen software.
            Not only that, they also steal hardware from customer devices, swapping in bad components.
Catricala : Jeez.
            *points* Those guys over across the street...?
Me        : Yeah. 
            I think they also install trackers and stuff to monitor their customers and clients.
Catricala : Well, holy fuck dude.
            *shakes head* Somebody should do somethin’ about that, for sure.
Me        : Well, that’s why I’m lettin’ ya know. 
            *taps chest* I’m basically the badass that’s doin’ somethin’ about it.
Catricala : *nods* Cool, I’m glad somebody’s lookin’ out for people around here...
Me        : I’ve got another question for ya.
Catricala : Ok...?
Me        : Did you know Bruce Tanski, Wormuth, and the former Town of Halfmoon Supervisor, are being investigated?
Catricala : Nah, I … didn’t.
Me        : Are you affiliated with them by chance...?
Catricala : Not really, I mean, Kelly Wormuth runs the Tae Kwon Doe place right there...
            I don’t talk to them much.
            Not really affiliated with Tanski in any way...
Me        : Alright... what about James Hughes...?
Catricala : James Hughes...? 
            The town judge...?
Me        : Yeah man.
Catricala : Look pal, Judge James Hughes is quite a great guy.
            I wouldn’t mess with that dude...
Me        : He’s the literal town justice... 
            ...has been for over 35 years.
Catricala : *cocks head slightly* Damn straight.
Me        : You just, can’t outdo a guy that literally walks a beat around his own town.
            In his own damn shoes.
Catricala : *chuckles* Buddy, I have something I need to tend to, anything else I can help you with...?
Me        : *momentary pause* You keep up the good work there, Mr. Catricala.
            Take care of yourself.

Now, the real conversation he and I had, only had certain elements of what I threw into the document.
Tanski, Wormuth and Amato were ALREADY investigated.
Most of it is fairly accurate. Neither one of us really had a fuckin’ clue, about each other.

By the way, James Leonard never had Scott Carpenter take an incident on this particular date for this 
particular interaction... Which should be seen as a RED FUCKING FLAG. Cause, hey. Maybe if Eric was 
actually concerned, he could’ve called it in right there and then. So, why didn’t he...?

Maybe I am the asshole here, for thinking that this theory is starting to make a lot more sense. Eric
didn’t strike me as the type of dude who’s doing this shit, to be fair. But, something else seemed off.

At that point in time, I kept accidentally coming across critical clues and details... 
Entire neighborhoods like the one that USED to be across the street from Lowes...? Oh. 
Maybe those people didn’t actually accept a BUYOUT... but instead, were TAKEN OUT... 
And then, now the land can be redeveloped. (not) Cool. Maybe I’m wrong.

            SOME GUY JUST SHOWED UP, SAYING YOU’RE BEING INVESTIGATED AND STUFF...
Tanski    : *alarmed* WHAT GUY...?
Catricala : I dunno, fuckin’ some dude from COMPUTER ANSWERS, or whatever.
Tanski    : OH YEAH...?
            COMPUTER ANSWERS, EH...?
            WELL...
            WE’LL JUST HAVE TO SEE WHAT PAVEL ZAICHENKO KNOWS ABOUT ALL THAT...
Catricala : Look buddy, why would they be investigating you AGAIN...?
            Thought they worked out a deal with you the LAST time you got investigated...?
Tanksi    : I don’t know, maybe they have another investigation goin’ on, now.
Catricala : Why would they be investigating you again, that’s pretty annoying.
Tanski    : Yeah, I know.
Catricala : Look buddy, I really can’t be doin’ illegal shit for ya, if you ARE being investigated...
Tanski    : Holy fuck.
            *shakes head* Look Eric, *points downward* I’m gonna get to the bottom of this... don’t you worry.
Catricala : Nah, I’m gonna worry, dude.
            I’ll come and eat breakfast at Snyders soon, then we’ll talk about it in person.
Tanski    : Alright, in the meantime...?
            *pointing downward* I AM gonna find out who the fuck this guy is...
Catricala : Alright, excellent.
            That’s what I like to hear.
            You know, besides all the illegal shit we do...?
            You’re a real stand-up guy, Bruce. 
Tanski    : Hey, anytime brother.

I had been saying quite a lot about Bell Atlantic, and how they have a dick basically jammed up everybody’s 
butt. Obviously not literally, but they are a friggen monopoly. These pictures were hand-picked to be left 
out of my uploads to Google Drive. How cool is that...?

This particular building struck me as odd, and like I said farther up, I had been keeping an eye out for places
that were abandoned and such. This place at 293 Middletown Road has some signs that say stuff about security...
Something really odd about this particular place.

Couldn’t whip my phone out of my Bat-belt fast enough, to get a good shot at a car that suspiciously passed by.

I found something rather terrifying in a couple of these pictures, then I saw anomalies in others.
There’s literally a GHOST CAR in one of these pictures, and 5 seconds later, MAN, it’s fuckin’ TOTALLY GONE.

Either these photos were altered to some degree, OR, there’s some fuckin’ paranormal activity goin’ on.
I’ve had dreams of this. Every single time someone takes a picture, they’re opening a realm of space-time
where these fucks can come in, and attack us. I didn’t quite understand that... and I think that’s what the
government is afraid to tell people. I couldn’t figure out WHY the hell some of my pictures were getting
censored or stopped from being uploaded, but it makes perfect sense now.

^ Oh by the way... I know someone’s gonna say “OooOooOOOooohhHHhh this dude’s a fuckin’ psycho~!” cause I 
said all that shit up above. But hey, this stuff is all THEORETICAL. Just like, it’s also a THEORY that 
us humans are alone in the universe, but that’s apparently not true at all. Check out the BOOTES VOID, and 
then apply the concept of the BOOTES VOID to the DISTORTIONS in each of the pictures. What you’ll find, is 
that there’s a very high chance that Derek Muller’s video about the first picture of a black hole could 
be APPLIED to the same distortion fields in these pictures. SOMETHING IS BENDING THE LIGHT.

So... whoever wants to say “oOOooOoOoOooohHHHHh”...? Maybe people that start to say that, they’re idiots.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I know that when I made my way to the Halfmoon Sheriff Substation, I took stable shots of the vehicles and the
cameras and all that, many of those pictures were ALTERED because it had a POST PROCESS applied to the pictures. 
There was either a post process being applied to these pictures, OR there was also something manipulating light 
propagation... or both of those things simultaneously. That’s how I know there’s some gay guy like Deputy Pirrone 
altering the shit on my phone, since the ghost car is literally right next to the vehicle he drives as the traffic
safety cop (4130 SUV). Not only that, but when I later UPLOADED these files, some dickhead tried to go ahead and 
remove those files even though I didn’t give them permission to do that (Ryan Ward). 

Now, I wasn’t CERTAIN that he was doin’ that at all. But it sure as hell felt like all the “coincidences”, 
were because someone I’ve known since I was a kid... they were the reason why this shit was happening.
Which is why I wound up going to Innisbrook the following day.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(5,"Solar Drive [|] (05/24/20 2200)",@"
Took some pictures on Solar Drive, found a meter that was not running at the cell phone tower, among some
other stuff. Note how some pictures are perfectly stable, and the others aren’t...? Well, that is a perfect
indication of a COCKSUCKER being involved somehow... The details are not so apparent until you apply this
additional property where the content of the particular image may show that some cocksucker doesn’t want
people to see something in particular. Sometimes you can be like me, right...? Tell people like SARAH
SCHELLINGER, KRISTIN JOHNSON, or LAURA HUGHES...? And, THESE <unspecified> will ignore that COMPLETELY. Shucks.

       Reminds me of ME, it could have been me taking a picture of myself accidentally, but I don’t think so. 
       It also has the white streak in the picture.

$Book.AddSection(5,"Mission Complete [|] (05/24/20 2300)",@"
I began to upload my files, pictures, and whatnot. Someone was still trying to be a lame motherfucker though.
Had to upload the pictures in smaller groups or chunks to avoid someone who was being a dickhead in the middle.

It’s basically a man-in-the-middle-who-sucks-dicks-a-lot attack. Sorta rhymes with Sir-Mix-A-Lot.
Shouldn’t be allowed to do such a thing, not if you’re an (internet/cell) service provider...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Here’s the thing, SOCIAL MEDIA is actually EXTREMELY USEFUL, because if you’re anything like me, people will 
go ahead and tell SOMEBODY that you said SOMETHING... and now, SOMEBODY ELSE is PROBABLY gonna THINK ABOUT... 
MAYBE doing SOMETHING about it, POSSIBLY... 

Now, you’re REAL fucked, dude... 
The party you were calling out...? Oh, they fuckin’ got the message LOUDLY and CLEARLY... 
That’s why they had so many commercials “Can you hear me now...? Good. Suck a fuckin’ dick, bro.” -Verizon

They fucked up by making it pretty obvious to me, that someone whined or complained about how apparently, I 
sounded like a real pain in the ass, right...? But instead of someone doing anything HELPFUL, they went ahead 
and kept a real close eye on me for NOTORIOUS REASONS. 

Cause, once they hear about something that someone said, somewhere...? 
They can figure out what’s goin’ on your device. EVEN IF IT DOES NOT HAVE A SERVICE PLAN... 
So, even if I was walking around with a locked SIM in the device, they can engage it to be a fuckin’ douchebag. 

Then again, [maybe the device itself is NEVER actually disengaged*]. 
So, if you have some phone laying around charging, and it’s not being used, oh well. They can use that shit.

Imagine that...? No warrant needed, for a company to charge customers money to still own all of the content
on their device...? That’s what they’re doing folks. You don’t own your 1) phone, nor 2) anything on it.
It’s theirs. You’re “renting” it from them. You take pictures? Those pictures belong to them. Not you.
Audio recordings? Those are also theirs too. *scoffs* You think you own any of the content on your device...?
Yeah right, bro. Text messages...? That’s theirs too. 

NOTHING ON YOUR SMARTPHONE BELONGS TO YOU. Could be wrong, but I doubt it.

Someone will read that and say “WOW BRO. This dude is out of his fuckin’ melon... there’s NO WAY, that MY 
service provider would EVER do that shit to me.”                                                    (← FALLACY ALERT) 

Yeah, there is a way that your service provider DOES do that...
...HAS been doing that...
...and might’ve been involved in the 9/11/2001 attacks.

“GASP~! NOW, WHY WOULD THEY DO SUCH A THING...?!?” 
Because, there were TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS on the fucking table, THAT’S WHY.

“I DON’T BELIEVE YOU.” 
Oh well. 
If you fail to consider how TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS is a perfect motive...
...then I don’t fuckin’ care what you think. Cause only a fuckin’ moron would think otherwise.

“I DON’T THINK THAT THEY WOULD DO SUCH A THING...”
Morons typically think that, because they grade each other on PERSONALITY over PRINCIPLE.
So, these people are very easy to (fool/lie to)... Then what happens, is that people grade each other on how 
much money they have, or how respected they are in the community... rather than having their facts in order.
So, if that is ALL people do...? That AUTOMATICALLY puts them into a category where they’re morons that assume 
too many things. Because, if someone with a LOT OF MONEY, and a REALLY GOOD REPUTATION, uses that to commit 
murders and shit... people may find the ACTUAL truth, to be too difficult to believe. (← FALSE ASSUMPTION)

The truth is often stranger than fiction... which means that things which are RARE, are often overlooked.

That person is probably correct about the latter part of the FALLACY ALERT statement up above... 
...they don’t bother doing this shit to people that have the reasoning above, because people who think like
that...? You have nothing they don’t already have. If anything, they know how stupid you are. So, you’re not a 
threat at all. You’re their loyal little fuckboy patsy, and there is absolutely nothing to fear about you.

I really don’t care who I offend with writing all of this shit, because the truth is, a lot of people deserve
to be insulted for not seeing all this shit. I’m no exception, sometimes I’m one of those people. I will insult 
myself constantly, for not knowing better, than to trust somebody that had every reason to lie to me.

America has a lot of morons in it, by the way. Some of those morons are police officers, politicians, teachers,
doctors, lawyers, judges, nurses... Eric Schnackenberg is a perfect example of someone that has a DOCTORATE,
but he is still a moron, because I’m certain that the man thinks like this up above as well.

Anyway, it wasn’t till I made a stink on Twitter at some point afterward, that somebody at Google took 
serious offense to one of my posts as I was being censored. They did me a solid, and then those pictures were 
restored~! Yeah. The pictures that FBI man decided to pull off of my account... oh. 
I found a way to tell THEM that THEY should actually go suck a fuckin’ dick for a change.
Pretty sure they didn’t like being told that...? But- nobody fuckin’ cares.

Some cocksucker in the middle, attempted to prevent my pictures from staying on my cloud account. 
I even said these things to SARAH SCHELLINGER, but she’s a fuckin’ moron. 
They have been aggressively doing this shit to me as far back as January 2019, perhaps even before that.

It stands to reason, that if they do all these things, then SARAH SCHELLINGER will always be 100% useless.
My bad. IF... they think about MAYBE doing SOMETHING ELSE at some point...?
Well... they’re gonna casually play it off as if they’re NOT tryin’ to be a real, wicked sneaky Pete.
Sneaky Pete’s used to be the place that only the coolest people of all, could collectively be found.
No exceptions. JUST cool people. Always. (I’m exaggerating)

These Sneaky McSneakerton’s might even do this a few times BEFORE they REALLY commit. 
You probably won’t even know they fuckin’... came around like 5 or 6 times BEFORE they did something. 
If it sounds ridiculous, that’s the point. Serial killers will do this, however.

That’s how stupid some people really are though. Are they all like this...? No. The people that are actually

worthy of being feared, are the ones most likely to show up and be a fuckin’ man about it. 
They’re not gonna tiptoe around like they’re walking on egg shells, trying not to DISTURB somebody that 
they talked about confronting at some point.

I mean, do I actually think anybody’s gonna help me in any helpful way, if don’t make it LOOK like I’m 
shouting into the fuckin’ void of infinite space...? I mean MAYBE. But I honestly never think to hold my 
breath. 

Then again, I might actually give someone an apology at some point once somebody APOLOGIZES TO ME FIRST...
Cause maybe I had somebody pegged incorrectly and I just had a ringing in my ear.

At least I’m not pegging anybody with a dick that just so happens to ALSO be a WRITING UTENSIL...
...one I could SHARPEN... I gotta say if you have a dick that you can sharpen though, that’s probably
dangerous in a totally different way than it should be... ya know...?

                  *finishes munching on a cracker* So what...?
Pencil Dickman  : WHY WOULD YOU SAY SOMETHIN’ LIKE THAT...?
Fatcock Goodman : *finishes munching on a cracker* To manipulate you.
Pencil Dickman  : *chuckles* Heh. Yeah, well, you FAILED bro... 
                  Otherwise I wouldn’t be here talkin’ to ya.                                       (← FALLACY ALERT)

Pencil Dickman  : Yeah, but... 
                  ...I was laughing sarcastically.
Fatcock Goodman : That’s still laughing. 
                  Like, you literally just laughed, and then said “that’s so funny I forgot to laugh”.
Pencil Dickman  : Bro, I challenge you to a duel.
Fatcock Goodman : Well, what kind of duel...?
Pencil Dickman  : A fencing match...
Fatcock Goodman : I don’t fence, dude.
                  Whaddya think I am, fuckin’ Obiwan Kenobi...?
Pencil Dickman  : Magic the Gathering, then.
Fatcock Goodman : I’d rather bang some bitches, man...
Pencil Dickman  : *scoffs* Obviously, anybody would.
Fatcock Goodman : I’m just sayin’... you could just go do that.
                  ...nobody’s stoppin’ ya.
Pencil Dickman  : *points finger* You’re pullin’ some shady shit right now, aren’t ya?
Fatcock Goodman : No. 
                  You challenged me to a duel. 
                  And I was like “I’d rather bang bitches...”
Pencil Dickman  : And I said “Obviously, anybody would.”
Fatcock Goodman : Look pal. 
                  Is there any sensible reason why a couple dudes would be having the same argument...?
                  AKA we agree on the same thing...?
Pencil Dickman  : Dude. 
                  You said some shit, now I’m here. 
                  So, we need to resolve this.
Fatcock Goodman : I mean, what the hell do you want from me dude...?
Pencil Dickman  : You owe me an apology.
Fatcock Goodman : Buddy, you haven’t done anything to earn one yet...
Pencil Dickman  : BRO, you literally made my girlfriend piss her pants laughing and embarrassed me...
Fatcock Goodman : Oh, well, how could someone as innocent as myself... 
                  ...do that...?
Pencil Dickman  : Cause my first name’s Pencil...? 
                  Havin’ a dick that I could SHARPEN, that’d make it dangerous?
                  Now my girlfriend just won’t stop LAUGHING. 
                  You’re a REAL ASSHOLE BRO...
Fatcock Goodman : I mean, you want me to take care of her...?

                  Dude thinks he’s so high and mighty with a name like “Fatcock”...
Fatcock Goodman : Hey buddy, that’s what my mother named me, so... don’t be a pencil dick, man.
Pencil Dickman  : That’s... my name though.
Fatcock Goodman : Pretty dangerous name, though. 
                  Might poke somebody’s eye out...
Pencil Dickman  : BRO.
Fatcock Goodman : Sup...?

                  MAYBE. 
                  POSSIBLY.
Fatcock Goodman : That’s some hypothetically dangerous stuff right there, man...
Pencil Dickman  : Yeah, it won’t be hypothetical if I have a dangerous weapon in my pants...
Fatcock Goodman : I agree...
                  ...that “Number 2”...

I reviewed a bunch of my files, I knew that some fuckfaced clown boy might be involved.
The thing about fuckfaced clown boys, is that sometimes they just randomly show up, attempting to make the 
situation APPEAR to be COINCIDENTAL. For instance, DEPUTY PIRRONE, or JOHN HOFFMAN.

I took a walk around with my son that morning, and MAGICALLY, ran into JOHN HOFFMAN checking the water meter 
in the back of Halfmoon Heights, with a handheld water meter reader. Now, it REALLY COULD have been a mere
COINCIDENCE, that this man just so happened to show up at the EXACT fuckin’ time that he did...? But, you 
really gotta consider the notion of comparing ANY coincidence at all, to someone wanting their dick sucked.

Is it coincidental to see some real hot girl you haven’t seen in years...? That probably is. Nobody just 
conveniently arranged all of the stars in the night sky, just for YOU to run into a run into a girl that 
caused a guy like YOU to think “Wow. I am fuckin’ really horny right now, by just lookin’ at HER...” 

Cause the future of the human race depends on you two gettin’ down. At the same time, however...
...if some gay guy tries to do the same thing...? That’s impossible. Just looks like a gay guy is HOPING 
that you don’t notice that he wants to get fucked in the same way that the hot girl does. Problem is, 
Deputy Pirrone and JOHN HOFFMAN sorta have some shit in common, where they’ll attempt to APPEAR as if, 
it’s just a fuckin’ total coincidence that they happen to run into me later on. 

Doesn’t necessarily mean they’re gay if I’m merely using that analogy as a METAPHOR. Which, I am. 

Walking around with my son, we walked behind Cheryl’s Lodge on a trail that goes toward Oak Brook Commons.
I noticed a moment beforehand, that John drove out of the water treatment area, and then he like, seemed to 
“inconspicuously” show up again (notice the “quotes”). This area is adjacent to Oak Brook Commons, which is
a place that his brother Jim apparently owns. I thought that his arrival at that location was A LITTLE TOO
COINCIDENTAL, actually. Regardless, my son and I spoke to JOHN HOFFMAN for a few moments.

    |                                                                                                       |
    | Anyway, these guys MICHAEL ZURLO, ERIC CATRICALA, BRUCE TANSKI, or really, anybody in CLIFTON PARK    |
    | that matters... none of them knew I actually worked at KeyCorp.                                       |
    | When I did, I handled THOUSANDS of calls.                                                             |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | This was during the FIRST NIAGRA → KEYBANK merger, back in 2016 under DANA BRANDOW/KAREN FOX.         |
    | ONE of those calls, was a ticket for JOHN HOFFMAN and his RELATIONSHIP MANAGER, at the Key Bank       |
    | branch at either 50 or 95 WOLF ROAD...                                                                |
    | That is about where the office he had, or still has, is located.                                      |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | The cool thing is, I learned about some stuff that normal SCSO or NYSP officers would never know...   |
    | ...such as “EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE FOR KEYCORP REQUIRES PREAUTHORIZATION...”                           |
    | “TO BE INSIDE ANY BRANCH OUTSIDE OF BUSINESS HOURS.” (← Cool shit, huh?)                              |
    | And, they can’t be alone, either. There has to be MULTIPLE PEOPLE THERE, so people don’t go stealing  |
    | money from the bank vault, or swapping the content of the drawers around, because then it can get     |
    | flagged as “somebody committed fraud SOMEHOW”.                                                        |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | Yeah, a woman that my mother has been friends with for DECADES, named ANNIE MADDEN.                   |
    | She worked in the FRAUD DEPARTMENT at KeyCorp, for YEARS. She probably had to make the calls that     |
    | never actually dealt with guys like BRUCE TANSKI and JOHN HOFFMAN doing shit that requires the FBI    |
    | to get involved and perform a PROBE...                                                                |

    | I will elaborate more on this event shortly. But- NICHOLAS DINOVA and PETER AMATO, very relevant to   |
    | FRAUD that TANSKI COMMITTED.                                                                          |
    | Ah man. That dude just slid `$60M between himself and MR. AMATO without ANNIE MADDEN’s DECADES of      |
    | experience at KEYCORP FRAUD DEPARTMENT, ever suspecting a fucking thing. Weird.                       |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | Back when I handled this instance of a program named KeyCounselor that crashed excessively...         |
    | GARY MCQUEEN, JUST SO HAPPENED TO BE IN THE NEXT CUBICLE, cause we sat next to each other.            |
    | The whole time.                                                                                       |

    |        That is...                                                                                     |
    |        JOHN fuckin’ HOFFMAN right there, bro...                                                       |
    | Gary : *popped his head in my cubicle* JOHN fuckin’ HOFFMAN, eh...?                                   |
    | Me   : Yeah.                                                                                          |
    | Gary : I heard he’s a fuckin’ REAL cool bastard...                                                    |
    | Me   : Maybe...?                                                                                      |
    | Gary : Look man, whenever I hear the word HOFFMAN, I’m thinkin’...                                    |
    | Me   : Car Wash, or Playland...?                                                                      |
    | Gary : *snaps finger* That’s right, dude.                                                             |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | GARY didn’t didn’t overhear me say that, either. But- he wound up being hired by MICROSOFT.           |
    | Cause, that’s where the world’s best software engineering has historically/factually, always taken    | 
    | place. They gotta hire guys like him, if they wanna continue being #1. Unsurprisingly, he got hired.  |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | As I handled this ticket, I kept the idea that I literally handled an incident where I LEGALLY saw    |
    | JOHN HOFFMAN’s financial information. He’s no billionaire, he’s got maybe a couple million.           |
    | His brother JIM HOFFMAN - owns Oakbrook Commons, probably has a LOT MORE MONEY than JOHN does.        |

JOHN HOFFMAN spoke with me, and my son, for a while. 
I can’t remember EXACTLY what I said, but he told me that he has a SECURITY COMPANY that, if anybody ever 
even THINKS about fuckin’ with his bank accounts...?

Well, in MR. HOFFMAN’s own words, his security team shows up LONG BEFORE THE POLICE DO...
...so that they can tell the police what happened.

Here’s the problem with MR. HOFFMAN saying that in front of: 
1) MICHAEL C. COOK SR. (me)
2) MICHAEL C. COOK JR. (my son)
...on (05/25/20 1200)...
...that’s like the SAME FUCKIN’ DAY that (2) fuckin’ queers that are associated with my cousin RYAN WARD, 
attempted to kill me.

Basically (12) hours prior to that, actually. How cool is that...?

JOHN HOFFMAN, and MICHAEL ZURLO really are that fuckin’ stupid. So are a lot of people at SARATOGA COUNTY.
Particularly LAURA HUGHES. May as well add KRISTIN JOHNSON to that list. And, Judge PAUL PELAGALLI.

The cool thing is, the police never “show up”. 
Nah, I’ve taken notice to this. 
They don’t do that.
If somebody breaks into an account, oh well. 
They don’t SHOW UP to DO anything, at all.
They may investigate stuff but they never SHOW UP.

So, if they happen to SHOW UP before the police do...? 
That’s because, the police never SHOW UP.

However, lets extend this FANTASY that John described to me and my son...
Suppose the POLICE DID SHOW UP...
...then they won’t be the REAL police at all. 
They’ll be the FAKE police like MICHAEL CHIKLAS and WALTON GOGGINS on the show THE SHIELD
Dirty cops, is effectively what I mean.

Bummer, this dude JOHN HOFFMAN said this to ME and my son.
My son will probably remember “Hey buddy, remember the guy who said he does COIN MAGIC...?”
He may say “Yeah.”
I will say “He’s a fuckin’ criminal. He also... does maintenance around the trailer park.”
Suppose they WERE to “show up” in a fictional story JOHN HOFFMAN expects me to believe...
...they will tell the police some stuff that has been arranged selectively... 
...which is JOHN HOFFMAN literally describing the process of committing FRAUD. 
“Drax... them... sklounst.”
In other words, JOHN HOFFMAN is a dumbass.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Anyway... after John expressed his opinion about how the police “do stuff”... 
He explained to us how he does magic for kids at birthday parties, and has been doin’ this stuff for SOOO long, 
he knows EVERY coin magic and sleight of hand magic trick that was ever created, throughout world history. 

Being a good magician that does impressive magic tricks requires GOOD sleight of hand, actually. 
Which means that it’s very possible to be a highly skilled thief, too. I believe Hoffman steals people’s mail. 
Isn’t the only person to do just that. I think he did this to my father, actually.

Not certain of that, but I saw some shit in the box that my dad left behind that caused me to believe that.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

John : I’ve got some videos on YouTube, I could send you a link or something if you want...
Me   : Sure bro. 
       I’m down.
       Say, have you ever heard of a guy named Eric Meade...?
John : Nah, can’t say that I have...
Me   : Oh, well, he’s one of the most talented coin magicians in the world, believe it or not.
John : Oh really...?                                     (← Doesn’t say I would’ve heard of him if I do “coin magic”)
Me   : Yeah man, you ever heard of Penn and Teller...?
John : Yes. 
       I have. 
       GOOD magicians, best in the industry.
Me   : Alright... 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

There is a chance that John Hoffman may not have ever heard of this dude Eric Mead, who does a trick that blows my mind.

Me   : Hey John, it was nice talkin’ to ya man.
John : Hey- you too buddy. 
       Take care~!
Son  : It was nice meeting you~!

       *After walking away, I explained the idea behind “A LITTLE TOO COINCIDENTAL” to my son, actually.*

Me   : Michael, that dude just conveniently showed up right there and then.
Son  : Oh, really...?
Me   : Yes.
       That doesn’t NECESSARILY mean that he’s doing anything WRONG...
       BUT- keep it pinned in MEMORY kid.
       Security teams aren’t supposed to “show up before the police do, and let them know what happened.”
       Cause if the police ever DO show up, the POLICE shouldn’t TAKE SOMEBODY AT THEIR WORD...
Son  : Really...?
Me   : Yes.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I didn’t really put a whole lot of effort or focus into MR. HOFFMAN, but he was somebody I would talk about in 
some of my audio logs, as well as BRUCE TANSKI. Audio logs I would record as I would walk around... Jeez. If 
somebody were to somehow mysteriously be a police officer AND made as many correlations I have made...? They
might actually be able to ARREST some people for committing FRAUD. It’s too bad that is WAY TOO DIFFICULT FOR 
ANYBODY TO DO... HUH. WEIRD. Well, it could be because the police would rather HELP these guys commit FRAUD.

    | would wind up reading too.                                                                            |

    | You can’t expect some useless cunt like LAURA HUGHES to detect this shit.                 (← BRIBERY) |
    | I have to openly insult people REPEATEDLY, because that’s how fuckin’ moronic they are.               |
    | A guy with millions of dollars swapping shit around...                                                |

    | HUGHES: “There’s no way that the cops would’ve never noticed something like that...”      (← FALLACY) |
    | Yeah, there is, cunt.                                                                                 |
    | There’s a way YOU missed it, so did KRISTIN JOHNSON, and everybody from LOCAL to STATE.               |
    | So when I say that CPS and OCFS LITERALLY ignored everything I said...?       (← CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES) |
    | I mean that they probably don’t have a single smart person that works at EITHER organization.         |
    | Does that sound offensive, at all...?                                                                 |
    | Oh well, it’s probably accurate.                                                                      |

    | ...leading to situations where NICHOLAS DINOVA will write BRUCE TANSKI a check for about `$6K...       |
    | ...or PETER AMATO will write BRUCE TANSKI a check for `$60M...                                         |
    | ...whether it’s for “political contributions”, or for “Kings Isle development”...                     |
    | ...TANSKI does something FRAUDULENT with it, PULLS IT OUT OF THE ACCOUNT...                           |
    | ...fills his anal cavity with a dildo SUPER QUICK...                                                  |
    | ...and WHEN TANSKI is DONE USING THAT MONEY...                                                        |
    | ...pulls the dildo out of his anal cavity FIRST...                                                    |
    | ...and THEN has a guy like JUSTIN BELLEVILLE put the money RIGHT BACK IN...                           |
    | ...after the BANK IS CLOSED, at like, 10PM...                                                         |
    | ...like on June 16, 2020...                                                                           |
    | ...and the people at KeyCorp Security are gonna be bamboozled when they eventually realize that they  |
    | trusted someone they shouldn’t have trusted at all. Then again, maybe they knew about it and just let | 
    | it happen. But if that IS the case...? That means someone’s breaking the fucking law and not being    | 
    | charged with a crime while someone ELSE who’s NOT breaking the fucking law, is ACTUALLY getting       |
    | pinned with those crimes.                                                                             |

    | WOW. AMAZING. Whether it’s PETER AMATO, or NICHOLAS DINOVA...?                                        |
    | THEY are gonna catch some fuckin’ SERIOUS CRIMINAL CHARGES for the FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY...             |
    | ...that (BRUCE TANSKI/JUSTIN BELLEVILLE) were THE ONES ACTUALLY COMMITTING.                           |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | And, like. I swear, I could tell ANNIE MADDEN like 50 times...?                                       |
    | “Someone would’ve done something about that by now, if that were the case, MICHAEL.”      (← FALLACY) |
    | That’s why I have to insult people.                                                                   |

    | That is, absolutely fucking amazing, isn’t it...? Man. So much stolen money, that some douchebag      | 
    | with `$0.00 can actually PAY PEOPLE LIKE LAURA HUGHES/FBI/ETC... to ignore all that ‘nonsense’ I       |
    | just said, cause BRUCE fuckin’ TANSKI, he’s such a fuckin’ AMAZING GUY... right...?                   |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | Like, I’m fuckin’ absolutely IMPRESSED.                                                               |
    | SO fucking absolutely IMPRESSED, just looking at him...? He reminds me of JOE PESCI from CASINO.      |
    | ...that movie is WAY too good, to start thinking BRUCE TANSKI is a bad guy cause of THAT alone.       |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | So is everyone else, apparently.                                                                      |
    | Everybody : Hey BRUCE, you look/act like JOE PESCI from the movie CASINO...~! I’M IMPRESSED...~!      |
    | And, because of how CONSISTENTLY IMPRESSIVE THIS MAN APPEARS TO BE...?                                |
    | Well, that AUTOMATICALLY must mean, he’d NEVER do something SHADY or ILLEGAL. Ever.                   |
    | That’s BRUCE fuckin’ TANSKI we’re talkin’ about bro. No fuckin’ way.                                  |
    | You’d be out of your cotton-picking mind, to think that this dude does bad shit... So...              |
    | Argument over, basically. It’s a wrap. Dude is too well meaning, to involve himself with crime.       |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | Center for Security would NEVER install an ALARM PANEL that could be DEACTIVATED REMOTELY either.     | 
    | ...allowing someone to go inside for a while, without PREAUTHORIZATION...? No way. Not them. Nah.     | 
    |                                                                                                       |
    | At which point, maybe it’s a good idea to get REALLY CREATIVE with how they could fuckin’ keep        | 
    | pulling that off, without like hundreds of ANNIE MADDENS, or TROOPER BORDENS, ever noticing.          |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | MAYBE, the camera system does the SAME EXACT THING that happens in the 1993 movie SPEED, starring     | 
    | KEANU fuckin’ REEVES, and SANDRA BULLOCK.                                                             |
    | “Tell that WILDCAT behind the wheel, to chill the fuck out.”                                          |
    | Ah, maybe I’m a lot more intelligent than people take me for.                                         |
    | So, it’s not (1) person doin’ all this shit, it’s (10) in harmony.                                    |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | You’d really have to be a fuckin’ moron, to say something like:                                       |
    | “There’s NO way that’s happening.”                                                  (← FALLACY ALERT) |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | How fuckin’ COOL is that...? That’s fuckin’ WAY awesome, isn’t it...?                                 |
    | Cause Bruce has so much (stolen) money, he can actually AFFORD to shove as many fuckin’ dildos as he  |
    | wants, up (HIS/MICHAEL ZURLO’S) ASS... and gets away with it squeaky clean (each/every) time, because |
    | ...the man knows how to clean some shit, alright.                                                     |
    |                                                                                                       |
    | Either way, BRUCE is fucking SOMEBODY in the ass. Whether it is HIMSELF, or not...? Doesn’t matter.   |
    | Better do what BRUCE wants, and shut the fuck up.                                                     |
    | Or else, BRUCE is gonna grab a WAY bigger dildo next time....                                         |
    | Then, MICHAEL ZURLO does what he’s told.                                                              |

I felt an urge to go talk to my aunt TERRI COOK. Also, RYAN WARD. 
Because I had some unshakable SUSPICIONS.
Having a comedic dialog probably won’t break the tension with the ALLEGATIONS I have to assign at this point.

| <INSERT IMG_0625.MOV> |
| <INSERT IMG_0627.MOV> |

I had a feeling that SOMEONE I KNEW was actually preventing some of my files from being uploaded.
Because they had my fuckin’ device hacked – with no fuckin’ service on the device, either. 

And, it was obvious at this point that they had all of my equipment commandeered. 
A SINGLE PERSON alone wasn’t doing this, but- a SINGLE PERSON made it pretty fucking OBVIOUS... 
...there was a CORRELATION between the pictures I took at the Halfmoon (Sheriff Substation/Town Hall), with 
STREAKS and stuff, applied to my photos. 

I took so many fuckin’ stable photos, so, why are they SUDDENLY all being ya know, FUCKED WITH...? 
There may be something terrifying happening... like “Ghost cars”, they’re in one frame, and the next...?
Totally fuckin gone. I only JUST noticed that as I wrote this document.

But also, intercepted in transmit and withheld from being uploaded...? 
Oh. Well, maybe someone IS actually moving around at the speed of light. Not a person, either.
Maybe there is an entire LEGION of DEMONIC SAUSAGE WRECKERS, that are actually doing all this shit.

The legion of demonic sausage wreckers, each imbued with the superhuman ability, to FELLATE the nearest man,
SO FAST, that nobody even knows why they just JIZZED in their pants with NO NOTICE, whatsoever. Somebody just 
shot a load, and they’re standin’ there, wondering how the fuck they JIZZED THEIR PANTS mid-sentence like that.

I gotta tell ya... probably feels AMAZING to suddenly JIZZ THEMSELVES, with no fuckin’ warning whatsoever...?
But it goes without saying, it’s cause the LEGION of DEMONIC SAUSAGE WRECKERS, exists. Light speed blowjobs.
JIZZING...? But- no fuckin’ warning, rhyme, or reason at all. That’s gonna piss some people off eventually.

Guy2 : What...?
Guy1 : Dude, I think I just jizzed in my pants...?
       *moves hand, checks*
       HOLY SHIT BRO... 
Guy1 : I DID.
Guy2 : What, you got some type of, erectile dysfunction or somethin’...?
Guy1 : Uh, nah bro, totally different problem...
       I swear, it’s like I just got some of the best head I’ve ever felt, but- instant.
Guy2 : BRO. 
       YOU GOT FUCKIN’ PROBLEMS BRO...
Guy1 : What, do you think I did this shit to myself...?
Guy2 : Uh...
       You’re the only one standin’ here except me, dude.
       So, if you just jizzed your pants...?
       *confused eyebrows* Then, yeah.
       You obviously DID just do that to yourself...
       Cause, I didn’t fuckin’ do that shit.
Guy1 : Dude.
       ...maybe I should go see a doctor, I guess...
Guy2 : *scoffs, shaking his head* Wow, bro.

One way you can manipulate people that think they’re in control, is to PRETEND that you don’t have the first 
clue. I really should just PRETEND a lot more often, because it works A LITTLE TOO WELL... MICHAEL ZURLO is 
a fuckin’ moron, man. 

I’m calling a dude with 30 fuckin’ years being an investigator, a moron. 
I’m not saying it to be MEAN... 
I’m saying it to be MEAN AND because it’s the truth. 
How did I, some douchebag who’s lived a life being a fuckin’ pathetic human being... 
...outsmart this fuckin’ dipshit...?

It could be because I’m smarter than many investigators, which means I should be an investigator.
One that gets paid to do that, by the way. And, has a badge. Suppose that I got as lazy as some people that
have a badge… as soon as I had a badge, I could start cutting corners and give myself excuses not to follow
any leads, so then it would be a null point. 

People that earn themselves a badge might just start lazily dragging people around like ragdolls on minimaps 
to get people in trouble for things they didn’t do… meanwhile, SOME shit happens, like CRIMES, and nobody 
does anything about it except accuse innocent people of doing something.

And THAT is why I wrote some shit on Facebook before I went to my aunt Terri’s (old) house. The reason why 
I had a team of people watching me, is because I am genuinely a lot smarter than most people. THEY are ALSO 
smarter than most people, except they have a SERIOUS issue with MORALITY. 

People don’t get it. If you have CORRUPT MORALS, then you’ll never have as much ACCURATE INTUITION, which 
means that WEAK WILLED PEOPLE, they will casually LIE to other people, and think nothing of it. 
Casually, being the key term there. 

THEN, when THEY are lied to, they will feel really butt-hurt and offended that YOU lied... 
They won’t fuckin’ care about when THEY lied, cause when THEY lie, that’s ok. Fuck you, they can lie.
Perfectly acceptable cause they’re a cunt like that. 

But, when YOU fuckin’ lie to them...? WELL... that’s BASICALLY a fuckin’ capital crime right there... 
So, the end result, is that most people think that a guy like me is bullshitting people because...
“There’s NO WAY that you could be smarter than most people. If you were, you’d be rich by now.”  (← 2x FALLACY ALERT)

Nah, if you tell the truth all the time, it is incredibly easy to outsmart useless cunts like LAURA HUGHES. 
That is how I OUTSMART people. Am I “perfect”...? No, I’m not. I’m a fuckin’ total prick, cause I use words 
to tell people how fuckin’ useless they are, sometimes. Especially when they write off my observations, 
effectively making ME feel useless, when I’m not. 

Sorta like the letter I wrote on 06/17/20, causing somebody I wrote about in that document to TAKE OFFENSE, 
right...? But I’m offended that so many morons just so happen to be MISSING SO MANY FUCKIN’ DETAILS. 

Otherwise, I would not be in this situation. So, saying something like “What, do I have to like kill somebody 
before people care about what I’m saying...?” Apparently, that IS what the FBI and many capitalists WILL do.

On the way to Terri’s house, I remember distinctly talking about how USA-Patriot Act/PRISM is being abused, 
didn’t know a damn thing about Pegasus. NOR that it could be used to see what the hell I was doing on my 
device with NO SERVICE. I speculated that it was there though, the whole entire time. When I got to their 
house, nobody seemed to be HOME or answering the door. I will eventually unpack and examine everything I said.

I decided to go the CP public safety building...

On the way there, I saw a jogger girl.  
She had a transponder and an earpiece. 
Not sure whether she was military or FBI, or what...? 

I said a bunch of stuff about the walk around town. 
I also basically lost my cool outside of the police station when I got there and saw multiple vehicles 
running idle again. I knew that THEY (not the State Police) had this fuckin’ software on my device, 
whether it was the State police, that’s NOT the point I was making. 

I saw this dipshit causing interference (blocking files from making it into my Google Drive account, or 
being extracted over the USB cable) over the last several days, didn’t know it was RYAN or a team of people. 
Nah, in actuality, I would’ve never realized that Ryan had these sorts of skills. 

So I DEFINITELY underestimated his ability to: double click a file that someone else wrote... not him.
Fuckin’ IMPRESSIVE double-click skills, let me tell ya... holy fuck, dude.

I am fucking blown away... at just how impressive, this dude is, at clicking a mouse button, TWICE in a ROW.
AS WELL AS: highlight some fuckin’ text.
I AM AMAZED BRO. 

Guess what I can do though...?
I can build the entire network that exists in any FBI building, or BUSINESS, or MILITARY FACILITY, CORPORATE 
OFFICE, RESIDENCE, INDUSTRIAL BUILDING... while you can sit there double clicking a program you never wrote.

How cool is that, fuckface? 
That means, you don’t actually need talent at anything you do.

The truth is, this dude DOES have talent at doin’ shit that’s ACTUALLY cool, like kicking the shit out of
a large number of people by himself, or smashing a stack of 30 bricks with one hand without breaking bones.

That is a genuine comment... that IS fucking IMPRESSIVE.
Maybe BRUCE TANSKI would be fucking FLOORED to see something that fuckin’ cool.

At any fuckin’ moment, my cousin, if he felt like not being an asshole...
...could walk into a building... just him and I... and the two of us...? Together...?

We could literally clean that entire building... 
Him...? Kicking the shit out of every single person IN the building.
Me...? Building or fixing the entire network of computers in it, or any variation or combination of repairing,
troubleshooting, routing wires, drilling holes... installing conduit, cameras, it’s a long list of things...

But, Ryan can effectively kick the shit out of 500 people by himself, with no help or weapons. 
Assholes could be coming out of doors like in the hallway scene in the Matrix, with brick-like body armor…?
This dude would snuff every single fuckface out. So, he’s dangerous.
Might be exaggerating *slightly*...? But he still has to register his bare hands as lethal weapons.

Anyway, after I went to the Clifton Park Public safety building and called some people out... 
I walked to the Shenendehowa campus. Figured it was time for me to just go there, and find a good place to 
stop and enjoy the scenery. By the time I got there my fuckin’ battery just about died. 
Didn’t stop me from making it to the Clifton Park Town Hall. I don’t remember what the hell I left there.
But- I know it had SOMETHING to do with Zappone.

After my phone died, I went home, and had a SHOCKING SUSPICION, that maybe my phone died as fast as it did, 
because it was BROADCASTING the content of the device. Yeah I knew it was doing that on Shen campus. I had a
feeling, a really fuckin’ creepy, eerie, odd feeling that the boogeyman was actually watching me. Not the 
Ryan “bookie” Ward boogieman either... I’m talking about the straight up, killed thousands of people in 
their sleep, spirit that haunts the Shenendehowa School District campus.

This son of a bitch got Ray Fetcho, but not in his sleep. He was my 8th grade Earth Science teacher...
“The earth bulges slightly at the equator, gotta remember... Fat guy in a hoola hoop.” RIP Mr. Fetcho.
I have a feeling, that having to tap into spiritual powers, is what’s gonna get me outta this fuckin’ mess.

I started walking around recording audio, I was talking about CAPITAL DIGITRONICS for a bit cause I kept seeing 
their car in a lot of places, (like, outside my neighbors’ driveway at 203D Halfmoon Circle) I didn’t think a
lot about it, but I saw that car in COHOES one time, near a place that I was doing work for Dr. JOHN LEN. 
I believe that somebody was hacking into his fuckin’ network. Pretty sure his office was TAPPED, way back 
on like *checks watch* 01/28/20.

Just about spoke to an FBI guy named: INVESTIGATOR CHRISTOPHER MURPHY at or about that time, too... 
Just about had someone from NFRASTRUCTURE take offense to the notion that I spoke to a woman out of state 
the night before, and somebody heard that and then they decided to go right ahead, and prove my suspicions 
were rather ACCURATE.

Man. That’s like, the day that CPS somehow got called on me, isn’t it...? 
Then some cool lady just went right ahead, and bought 2x beds for my kids...
...cause I caught her RECORDING ME AND MY MOTHER. 
For...? I think, Mr. Pickett. 

I even flat out said to this lady “You’re recording us for Mr. Pickett”. 
And she like, flat out lied to me... 
But, hey, guess what, I’m not an oblivious moron, I sorta expected it.

The COOL thing is, that I knew SCOTT SALVADORE sorta let the cat outta the bag, when LISA MENTES came to 
my house like a few months beforehand, and SCOTT said something that caused me to KNOW WITH SHEER CERTAINTY, 
that SOMEBODY was actively surveilling me, with at LEAST 1x microphone. 

SCOTT even said ‘you’re a naughty boy bro’ and, JOHN PICKETT might be the reason. 
These dudes probably watch JUST to get a glimpse of what I’m like...

Once you let the cat out of the bag... you gotta unzip, and get to work. 
Even if you’re AT work...

Although John is married...? 
He occasionally watches porn, and jerks off to it.
He’s not gonna stand for being the (1) guy that allows ME to jerk off to GOOD porn, undetected...
...without HIM doin’ that right alongside me too.

Not physically right next to me, but … obviously you know what I mean.
Nothin’ wrong with seeing some of the porn I watch, cause it’s GOOD.
Like KarmaRx is pretty good. I won’t waste my time watching something that isn’t.

HOWEVER... How do these people know that I might be doin’ that...?
Well... they profiled me. They used a probability matrix like no other, and they have my psychology down...

Yeah, if anybody has had a rather close eye on me after the 8 years I didn’t work at NFRASTRUCTURE at all...
It was JOHN. Not watching me watch porn (at least not always)...
...but watching because he’s always been impressed by what I say or do (I don’t get it).
In a way, where he won’t say it to other people. 

He fuckin’ read the email I wrote, and he will fuckin’ stare at it for a while...

The pattern I had detected, was that this fuckin’ CAPITAL DIGITRONICS was showing up in coincidental locations
and, seemed pretty strange to me. I have a feeling that these people living across the street are RUSSIAN SPIES.

I later spoke to the owner of the company, Mr. McCabe, and I was able to determine that I had something wrong 
about the company, where I associated that company to the one belonging to a Russian guy that used to rent the 
5th floor of 46 State Street, prior to 2003 when they moved out. 

That’s when I met “KGB Agent Jillian Cook” *I can stand to be corrected about that if I’m wrong*... but, 
ya know, people are RARELY ever smart enough to DO that. Yeah, I think my “aunt” JILL, might be RUSSIAN INTEL.

That’s basically me insulting my uncle Thomas Cook, telling him that he’s a fuckin’ moron to not see that.
Sometimes, in order to PROVE THAT YOU CARE ABOUT SOMEBODY, you have to INSULT THEM.

[I believe that guy (5th floor) may have been spying on my uncle], and Jill was basically the plan for AFTER,
that dude moved out of 46 State Street in 2003. I believe my aunt Terri was also involved in that, somehow. 

My family had quite a bit of money from my grandfather spending 50 years busting his ass driving trucks to 
support 4 girls and 3 boys. I talk about my grandfather later in this story.

I started recording audio and walking the way I normally do, coming out from Oak Brook Commons, a car looked 
like it was about to hit me near ERIC SCHNAKENBERG’s building, Red SUV. I kept walking, recording audio, got 
to MATCHLESS STOVE AND CHIMNEY, and just kept recording audio walking toward BURGER KING area.

Scope out Karel’s house/area, I had been watchin’ that house for a reason, as I suspected somebody working in 
the post office is doing some real shady shit. I made it to Chelsea Place and began to talk about Tati and 
Ryan, since I had a strong suspicion that he’s killin’ people, and she knows it. 

I think it has to do with his trip to Africa among a lot of other shit.
_________________________________________________________
| Q : Why did I say what I did, about Tati and Ryan...? |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I had a damn good reason to.
What these people don’t know, is that PRIOR to the attack, these guys had a car parked right where Tati used 
to park her car when she worked at Lowes. My friend Samantha Caine also worked there for a long time, and 
basically parked in the same spot.

These (2) guys that were chasing me on foot...? OH. They fuckin’ had a car parked there AHEAD of time... Weird.
There’s NO WAY that they could’ve just accidentally parked it there before they fuckin’ chased me from the 
laundromat to Lowes, is there...? I had a feeling that SCSO had a unit waiting to pick me up somewhere. 

Cause I saw (3) of them drive around the (Goodyear/USA Gas/Firestation block) about an hour beforehand.
I was convinced that Ryan had known the (3) guys that held a gun to my cousins’ girlfriend living in Hillside, 
way back in 2011-2012. (2) of those dickheads planned this attack ahead of time. That means PREMEDITATED.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

I heard the “bird” outside of Valvoline, near the hotel on Northside drive... I’m putting the word “bird” in 
“quotes” because it didn’t sound like a regular, every-day-at-the-park, type of bird. Nah, not THIS one.

I sensed that this thing wasn’t a real “bird” AGAIN... 
I WAS making assumptions on what it COULD be saying, NOT like Dr. Dolittle. 
More like, listening for PATTERNS or INFLECTIONS just like a PERSON makes, when they use VOCAL RESPONSES.

So imagine if you would, some dude from down South, who’s accent is SO FUCKIN THICK, you really don’t know 
what the fuck that dude is even saying...? Like that. You have to ASSUME things: PATTERNS, INTONATION, and 
INFLECTIONS, however- the last one is pretty challenging to do if you’ve never seen Chica, on like Sprout.

Dude’s basically talking with a goddamn kazoo. 
Weird thing is, the thing I heard kinda sounded like that.     
To be perfectly honest, I might’ve understood what I ASSUMED I was hearing.

It’s a good thing I listened to it. Somebody was trying to tell me to go to her house. 
Like a human female, one that’s in this story. 
But I did stop and think to myself, “That’s basically fuckin’ impossible...right...?”               (← FALLACY ALERT)

It probably IS possible. 
But- you will really come off sounding like a complete fuckin’ nutcase to make that claim. Why...? 
Idk bro. People have a hard time believing the PENTAGON... recorded UAP footage. 
And then, released a report about it. 

Literally, the official US Government went ahead, and said “Aliens are real.” 
I’m not certain about this, but I do have some belief, that humans have an understanding of “TELEPATHY”...

And, these aliens have it down to an artform. 
It works a lot like QUANTUM PHYSICS.

^ I do my fuckin’ homework on complicated shit. 

Now, this “bird”, might’ve been a friggen 3d ball comin’ through MY dimension... almost shitting a brick. 
WHOA. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT, BRO...? But, I kinda I understood it. So, I think the ants in the 2d flatlander 
land, will actually understand something in a higher dimension. It’s just that RELAYING that information to 
OTHER 2d flatlander ants, is pretty fuckin’ difficult. Neil DeGrasse Tyson, he’s like “The smartest men on 
Earth, likely pale in comparison to some alien in like, Kindergarten...” He’s right. Humans are not dumb...
But, they have a fuckin’ REAL serious problem, and they like to kill each other for senseless reasons.

Which is why Cortana, and even TALKING about it, is gonna attract the wrong fuckin’ attention. 
Because, these aliens already know how to build it, and they wanna know if we can build it too.
I think it is because IF THEY ARE here, they might be STUCK here, and they need us to “grow the fuck up.”
...to help em get home.

I vaguely remember a number of my Facebook posts AT pr ABOUT that time... about stuff like: 
1) Mustard sandwiches
2) How can life hand you lemons, if it has no hands...? 
3) Releasing a wasp flying around in my room, instead of killing it 
4) some stuff about Karl Sagan
5) holding the anti-mass spectrometer to 80%, and holding it til the carrier arrives, things of that nature...

I had a feeling that SOMEONE DID THEIR HOMEWORK ON ME, and my sly comments and ideas pushed em into 
poppin’ their head out to say hello. Yeah. Somebody thinks I’m a funny bastard. 

The MORAL in each of those things I quoted up above, is something EVERYONE should consider.
1) Billionaire Mark Cuban, survived for a long time on next to nothing, eating mustard sandwiches every 
fuckin’ day, until that motherfucker succeeded. 2) When they say “if life hands you lemons, make lemonade”, 
it can’t do that, because a no-handed, no-faced nobody has no hands to hand anybody any lemons. Doesn’t 
mean people need to be sour about it... 3) Most people will see a wasp flying around and grab the nearest
fuckin’ newspaper, or whatever...? And smash the fuckin’ wasp to kill it. Aw. What if some giant thing did
that to YOU...? Aw. ← Or, do what I explained, and let the damn wasp outside. That thing deserves to live 
an equal amount as anything else alive. It’s not a problem to let it go, if it’s not a threat. ← BIGGEST 
thing wrong with HUMANITY. And then, 4) just being mad slick about inserting a comment from Half-Life, 
cause, bringing the anti-mass spectrometer up to 80 percent...? That’s what a badass like Gordon Freeman 
does. Top notch scientist who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that’s gotta fuckin’ 
deal with this clusterfuck that the scientists FORCED him into. (I think Gordon Freeman in the story, 
graduated from MIT)

Nah, the story of Gordon Freeman is basically: Everything’s fucked bro... Now, you gotta survive. Who cares 
how you got here...? You’re Gordon Freeman. Far from a free man. Gotta crawl through vents, grab some crow 
bars, bludgeon some fuckin’ ugly ass headcrabs, shoot some things that sound like a hoover vacuum, dodge
friggen’ lightning bolts that keep gettin’ tossed at ya, by one-eyed Vortigaunts...? Dude. How the fuck is
this (1) singular dude, supposed to survive against all this shit...? The military trying to kill him,
strings hanging down from the ceiling trying to suck him in, having to ration his ammo and health packs, 
keep trying to kick his feet until he makes it to the surface...? Everything is trying to kill this dude.
Why...? Nobody has an answer for that, but when the first question asks “Who cares...?” Well, Gordon 
would’ve cared, AND, isn’t the only one. 

The person reading the story cares. Or, playing the game. 

The book I left with this girl ~20 years ago, is all about TELEPATHY. (I think)

That’s gonna piss off a bunch of dumbasses like (some of) the people at SCSO...
Cause they want an EASY PAYDAY, and they don’t really CARE for things like ACCURACY, at all.
MOST HUMANS DO NOT LIKE ACCURACY... cause they’re morons. 

So, let’s say that you’re fuckin’, cK.Fatal1ty, right...? 
Dude had the highest ACCURACY in Quake III Arena.

Made so many children cry to mommy and daddy every time he SCHOOLED them at the game.
Literally every other game he played, he didn’t have to play it for very long, before he was owning the 
best players in that fuckin’ game. Wanna know why...? ACCURACY PISSES OFF PEOPLE WHO CHEAT A LOT.
...it’s bound to piss off the people who fuckin’ suck ass at the game without CHEATING, like Michael Zurlo 
does. Cause he’d rather put his thumb on the scale, and never be good at aiming, cause it’s a lot easier.

I took a picture of the building that had a single room with the light on, there’s never any cars there. 
Ever. Same thing with Matchless Stove... 
Anyway, yeah I don’t know, I think whatever this thing is, MAY VERY WELL have something to do with the book.

Like the book is a self-embedded prophecy, of someone’s life. REAL life. But that can’t be true, can it be?

At or about this time I began to walk toward COMPUTER ANSWERS. 
Little did I realize it, but these guys were figuring out a way to attack me.
That’s when they parked in Lowes. 
I don’t really quite understand their motivation beyond being pretty reckless. 

I got to the Animal hospital area, and remembered a dream I once had... 
...that is when a vehicle that I believe was a black dodge dart, tried to hit me. 

At which point I remembered drawing up parallels with TERRI and PAVEL. 
I believe they have some ASSOCIATION, and it may be resultant to PAVEL ZAICHENKO SR. 
I think he did a lot of business with the guy on the 5th floor of 46 State Street. 
I think he is the one that was listening to the dispatcher the night SAMMY was killed, but also JOHN PICKETT.

PAVEL ZAICHENKO SR. was INCREDIBLY evasive when I spoke about my father in NOVEMBER 2018 in SCHENECTADY.
Entirely dismissive, actually. But I don’t think he had anything to do with my father’s death at all.

Regardless, I know the association exists between Ryan and these 2 guys I saw.

The evil spirit, the boogieman of Shenendehowa... he got Ray Fetcho and plenty of other people.
He’s been trying to get me too, but, my dad keeps tellin’ him it ain’t happenin’, Cap’n.

Pretty sure my father is the reason why I knew something was up on the campus earlier that day, as well as 
in front Trickshot Billiards later that night. Yeah. I saw a flash of light or something in my eye that I’d 
never seen before. People are gonna say “OooOOoOOooOohhHhhhhHh you have a sixth sense or somethin’, eh...?” 

Yeah fuckface. I do. I might not have a pencildick...? 
But- I don’t even NEED one, dude. 
*tapping chest* I’m MICHAEL COOK... And, I’m gonna continue to ‘accidentally’ fuck up every bad guys’ day/life...
‘Accidentally’ SHOULD piss all of em off. “Dude keeps ACCIDENTALLY screwing everything up dude...? WTF~!”

Yeah cause … if I say it was all intentionally well thought out ahead of time, then I had a way of premeditating 
ALL of that shit that didn’t even go to plan.

Nah, I fuckin’ had somewhat of a clue. Just think, if they sent some guys that were smarter than I am, they 
probably could’ve been a lot less obvious. So, I kept thinkin’ about recording a video just talking some shit.

$Book.AddSection(5,"Flashback [!] The Attack",@"

Me :  Hey, everybody, Michael Cook comin’ at ya with a deep-inside look...
      Catricala Funeral Home, has a little building in the back.
      Suspected bodies being thrown into concrete foundation slurry...
      Oh, what’s that...?
      Dudes walkin’ around at *checks watch* 1143PM...? 
      That’s not weird or suspicious at all, bro...~!
      Oh, what’s that...? 
      Fuckin’ familiar lookin’ bad guy, comin’ up on the left...?
      Alright... Time to record video...   
      FUCK. 
      That was a picture of the Boomer McCloud plaza AND the building behind the Catricala Funeral Home...

      Dude’s wearin’ a hat. 
      Glasses. 
      Sorta reminds me of Austin Evans, from YouTube.
      Nowhere near as cool lookin’ though...
      I’ve seen this guy before...
      Gotta make sure he can’t hear me out loud, sayin’ all this stuff.
      Might lose the element of surprise.
      *dude within earshot, go back to sounding newsy*
      We think this dude had something to do with a bunch of people going missing.
      Throwing bodies into concrete foundations, that’s illegal, believe it or not...
      Hey buddy~!
Guy : Hey how’s it goin’...?
Me  : Good man.
      Say, are you from around here...?
Guy : Uh, well I am.
      But- I moved away, and then I moved back, so...
Me  : Hey, that’s cool. 
      You don’t JUST SO HAPPEN TO KNOW this Catricala dude, or whatever, do ya...?
Guy : Nah, CAN’T SAY THAT I DO...
Me  : Oh, well... this dude’s been THROWIN’ DEAD BODIES into concrete foundations.
Guy : *crosses arms* OH REALLY...?
Me  : I THINK SO...
      SOMEBODY SHOULD PROBABLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT, RIGHT...?
Guy : Uh, yeah.
      That shit sounds illegal... (← NOT “OoOOOoohhhHh don’t you think somebody would’ve done something by now?”)
Me  : Maybe it isn’t illegal.
Guy : *confused look on face* What...?
Me  : Hey, thanks buddy, you’ve been really helpful.
Guy : What the hell are you even talkin’ about...?
Me  : Don’t worry, you’ll know.
Guy : *shakes head* Alright, yeah, thanks I guess...?
      *starts walking toward Walmart*
Me  : *continue sounding TOTALLY OBLIVIOUS*
      Oh, what’s that...? 
      You’re from around here but you moved away and came back...?
      Huh...?
      Well, dipshit...

Prior to THIS EVENT RIGHT HERE, I don’t think that ANYONE IN THE WORLD, had ever MANIPULATED these people,
into using this program against a specific target, EVER... and RECORDED IT ON VIDEO.

As in, Michael C. Cook Sr. has a “disabled iPhone” because... he was the 1st HUMAN IN HISTORY, to EVER 
record VIDEO, of someone using this DANGEROUS PROGRAM → PEGASUS/PHANTOM. Not only the 1st, but the 2nd 
AND 3rd TIME, too. The FIRST and SECOND times, those videos exist, I extracted them. They’re available.
1) IMG_0405.mov 
2) IMG_0432.mov  
They were actually on a list of videos I went taping door to door.
Like, 08/10/20. SHOCKING, RIGHT...? Well, stuff gets hidden in plain sight all the time. 

I wasn’t making outrageous claims that whole time, what I was doing, was “making history”. 
I’m fairly certain I’m not the first person in history to record evidence of this program, HOWEVER, the people 
that USE the program to SPY on people, without being DETECTED. 

They were sure as shit DETECTED alright, and then CAUGHT by a CIVILIAN.                             (← unprecedented)

It’s like Prince Andrew saying “I’ve never seen that girl (Ms. Guiffre) in my entire life, dude. 
I’d rather be found suckin’ some dude’s dick, than EVER admit, that I HAVE, in fact... 
...most DEFINITELY fucked that really hot girl I have SUPPOSEDLY never seen before in my entire life...
...when she was like, 17 years old...”                                                            (← he really would)

The FIRST time (← [IMG_0405.mov] 05/23/20), being the kid on his bike right outside of Snyders. 
Kid on his bike, may not have realized, that I said: 
“Oh, bro... Gotta FIGURE OUT WHO THAT KID IS, without like, bothering him...”

The SECOND TIME (← [IMG_0432.mov] 05/23/20), would’ve been in Jonesville, near the Jonesville Fire Station.
I say in the video: “Dude’s watching the stream right there...” 
...cause some kid just came out of his house attempting to look inconspicuous. 
What made it even MORE compelling, is when these idiots spliced videos together. 

Third time...? (← [IMG_0647.mov] 05/25/20 2343 → 05/26/20 0004)
The way better version of the chunk of realistic dialog I just wrote above.
Trooper SHAEMUS LEAVEY has seen this video, so have my children.

That video DOES EXIST ON THIS DEVICE THAT HAPPENS TO BE LOCKED BY A GREEDY MANUFACTURER NAMED APPLE.
NO WRONG PASSCODE WAS ENTERED INTO THE DISPLAY 10 TIMES TO CAUSE THAT.
TIM COOK SHOULD TRY TO SUCK A LOT LESS DICK FOR A CHANGE... CAUSE HE WILL NEVER COME CLOSE TO STEVE JOBS.

Sure, the company is worth `$3T now, but the cost involved turning a blind eye to ZERO-DAY EXPLOITS.
But, suppose he fuckin’ REALLY wanted to... 
He could fuckin’ help me get the video off of the device.

IF HE DID, he would earn my respect and I would make a formal apology for all the times I insulted the man.
And then, file the largest [Class Action Lawsuit in history against APPLE].

HOWEVER, that company is worth `$3T for very specific reasons. 
Not cause they’re HONEST, but because they’re FACILITATORS, CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER to their own customers.

I have no doubt that this program HAS actually been recorded on video before, BUT- those people have all 
probably been killed. And then the evidence was destroyed.

iPhones make a perfect tool for the system that causes people to FEEL like they have EVIDENCE...
...then it’s gone...~! It WAS there... it DID exist...? But magically, some cocksucker at APPLE...
...disabled your device OR, helped someone else accomplish that. 
Cool shit bro.                         (← I will swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth)

Maybe KRISTIN JOHNSON at SHENENDEHOWA could’ve been a LOT more useful than she WAS.             (← THANKS A LOT LADY)
Maybe LAURA HUGHES at SARATOGA COUNTY CHILDRENS PROTECTIVE SERVICES could’ve ALSO been, be a lot more useful. 
Maybe RICHARD TODD LOEBER could stop 1) COMMITTING MEDICAL FRAUD, 2) VIOLATING HIPAA, 3) READ THE DSM5 SOMEDAY,
and 4) STOP THROWING PATIENT’s SHOES https://drive.google.com/file/d/13SaVBgHJpXWZSLw7casjRTktJchTisNY 
...in the TRASH after being HUMILIATED by a PATIENT that OUTSMARTED HIM...
...instead of making FALSE (ACCUSATIONS/DIAGNOSIS)                                      (← SAME WITH SUSAN MCDERMOTT)

TWO WOMEN that I am not certain, were involved in this MRS. SMITH, and MRS. MATURA – my 6th grade teacher. 
These women were admittedly helping me with my daughter, they were trying to help the single dad, since the 
MOTHER felt like being a <unspecified>, and abandoning her children.
Yeah, it’s an OFFENSIVE DESCRIPTION, but THAT IS WHAT SHE DID.

They took my daughter to her dance recitals, FOR me, cause dad was doing work related to MATTERS OF NATIONAL
SECURITY, and couldn’t really TELL people THAT IS WHAT I WAS ACTUALLY DOING. 
EVEN IF I TOLD PEOPLE THAT, WHO THE FUCK WILL CARE...?                                (← People will definitely care)
So, it is what it is. 

The way I see it, EVEN IF I LITERALLY TOLD PEOPLE THAT...?
Oh well. People really are stupid.      (← until the story becomes too large to contain, then they’ll go OOOoOohHhHh)

That’s why I’m not just a PROFESSIONAL.
I AM AN EXPERT. It’s not an OPINION, It’s an OBSERVATION, an OPINION, AND a FACT.
So, DENNIS BRUCE at Saratoga County Family Court, can fuck along, and go suck a dick.              (← Fuck you dude.)

Normally, when you’re working with matters of national security, you don’t just go around telling people...
“Ah, yeah. I’m basically working undercover attempting to catch serial killers in the act.”
“As a matter of national security.”

Before you know it, it’s not lookin’ all that accidental, but the truth is, maybe they could’ve been JUST about
to lunge at me and I like, accidentally tripped over my shoelaces AS they were lunging at me.

Instead of even being stabbed...? Dude just looks like some idiot behind me. “Yo, you dropped somethin’...”
The ol’ dude-accidentally-tripped-on-his-shoelace-so-he-didn’t-get-stabbed gag. Yeah I did drop something, 
my balance, and my face... “Ah fuck dude. Sorta looks like some dumb motherfucker was trying to stab me WHILE
I was tripping on my shoelaces...” Now you’re REAL fucked, dude. How’s he gonna explain the knife in his hand?

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me  : Hey buddy, is that a fuckin’ knife ya got there...?
Guy : Nah, somethin’ TOTALLY different.
Me  : Oh, well... looks like a friggen knife, dude.
Guy : Nah, it’s a dildo.
Me  : Oh WOW buddy.. that looks like a fuckin’, real sharp dildo ya got there...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Nobody’s gonna believe that somebody JUST SO HAPPENS to have a sharp lookin’ dildo in their hands...
If it was a pencil, like Ryan Ward’s fuckin’ dick, and he JUST sharpened it, then MAYBE.
As far as I can tell though, you can’t sharpen a dildo.

So, this dude may have had an “edge” NEAR me... but, never really had an “edge” ON, IN, or INSIDE OF me.
Cause I fuckin’... ‘accidentally’ caught him on video, and this dumbass motherfucker was probably calling ME
a dumbass motherfucker at the same time... 

Just a pair of dumbass motherfuckers lookin’ at one another, calling each OTHER a dumbass motherfucker...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me  : You dumbass motherfucker bro...
You fell for it...

| Meanwhile… |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Him : What a fuckin’ dumbass, dude...

Unreal.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Confused...? Well, now NOBODY even knows what the fuck is goin’ on... 
So, who the hell knows what...?
Somebody DOES know something, but, how...?
Somethin’ went down, but whether it was a couple of very conveniently timed ‘accidents’, 
OR... someone manipulated a bunch of people to reveal a DEADLY SECRET...?

The secret’s out, motherfucker. 
The cat's out of the bag, and it ain't goin' back in, either.                  (← The entire point of the book)

This “SERIAL KILLER” = Kid 1...

Kid 1 had a buddy = Kid 2. (They’re brothers)
Pretty sure they’re BOTH serial killers, a team.
After I recorded Kid 1 on video showing a “physical reaction” which caused me believe that he... 
...had remote access to my device (had NO service)... I just kept the camera rolling. 

While I didn’t accidentally trip or anything like that, and Kid 1 never had a sharp lookin’ ‘dildo’ in his 
hands, at least not from what I was able to see. He could’ve had one in his pocket or something. I had a 
suspicion that they weren’t gonna use a gun or anything with bullets. They don’t like the easy way, they 
love stabbing people to death. 

I believe they may have the same type of training that Ryan has, like (CQC/close-quarter combat).
I think Kid 2 actually had a weapon in his hands, but he wouldn’t show up for a few minutes... 
After I recorded the reaction of Kid 1, and then went back to the other side of the street, to Computer Answers.

Kid 1 stayed on HIS side of the road walking toward Walmart, I believe he walks PAST Mobil to Hess/Speedway, 
and THEN walks across the street toward Hewitt’s, and then... magically decides to walk back toward Mobil.

Somehow this dude amazed me in the amount of “raw talent” he had, at “failing to trick me again”... 
...cause that dude JUST SO HAPPENED to have a vehicle conveniently parked there, already.

Another SHOCKING coincidence...~! Me, standing there, jaw wide open... in total shock.
On the fucking total edge of my seat... 
Just another hair-raising episode of “Morons trying to fool me, but failing” starring: Michael C. fuckin’ Cook Sr.

$Book.AddSection(5,"Story [~] Top Deck Awareness",@"
Once upon a time, a man once lived in the crime-riddled badlands of suburbia... in Clifton Park, NY.
A KEYBOARD WARRIOR, whose story was unlike any other, unparalleled in nature. One night he was nearly
killed and somehow barely survived. His story and voice were both so gritty...? Well, people could
practically feel the bits of gravel pelting off of their eardrums when he told the tale...

His brush with death revealed a DARK, TWISTED SECRET that laid BURIED, beneath the surface of his home
town, HIDDEN in PLAIN SIGHT. A DANGEROUS & ELUSIVE [RACKETEER INFLUENCED CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION], a ring
of CROOKS, CRIMINALS, BANKERS, PUBLIC SERVANTS, and SERIAL KILLERS, joined as one unstoppable force.
All in the name of becoming something EVIL and SINISTER, committing: HOME INVASIONS, ROBBERIES, RAPES,
MURDERS, FRAUD, RACKETEERING, EXTORTION, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT, IDENTITY THEFT & CYBERCRIME.

They've corrupted many (county/state/gov.) agencies, killed many people, gotten very rich, and they've
never been CAUGHT. A legion of bad-ass detectives have known about this force... They've be fighting
a seemingly never-ending war against them. But- they've grown weary. Their sanity...? Depleted.
Their patience...? Worn thin. Still, if there's anything they can count on...? Crime never sleeps.

This is the story of a man who rose to the challenge, to begin a white-knuckled fight against ID theft &
cybercrime, until he discovered a series of clues that directly linked those at the center of the RICO,
to his FATHER who had been KILLED a LIFETIME ago. An INVESTIGATION, DECADES in the making, REVEALING
SECRETS, CLUES, and REALIZATIONS- all EXPOSING the EXISTENCE of his dad's TRUE killers. THEY CONSPIRED
to have him EXECUTED by a MERCENARY in 1995. However, making his dad's murder LOOK like a foiled robbery
was a fatal mistake... they committed the ultimate sin.       

The ones that GREENLIT his father's execution...? They really were dumb enough to try and kill HIM too,
only to fail miserably, whereby unraveling a MUCH larger, uglier, even MORE sinister truth. Those who
killed his father revealed themselves. Whereby jeopardizing their riches, livelihood, and elusiveness.

One night before all of the chaos began, this keyboard warrior, this cybercommando, visited his grave.
Staring at his father's legacy, engraved in stone... he spoke to him for some time. As he was leaving,
he vowed to avenge him, and leave a mark on the world in his name. Then, as if its timing was fate,
or destiny...? A shooting star fell from the heavens. From that day forward, his mission became clear.

His life...? Imbued with hardship. Pain. Scorn. Resentment, and atrocities. The love of his life...?
Ripped away, outside of reach. His children...? Taken, and lied to. When society told him...
             ________________________________________________________________________________
             | Society : If life hands you lemons...? Make lemonade.                        |

             |           How can a no-faced, no-handed, nobody, HAND anybody any lemons...? |
             |           That's impossible...                                               |

he common-folk would roll their eyes for being 'ridiculous', but- his argument made total sense.
ven though he never was a cop...? He didn't NEED to be. He still impressed those who were. Some knew,
nly HE, could truly fulfill the task of being something MORE. Something symbolic... something legendary.

his is the story of a man who's faced a lot of resistance, a story SUPPOSEDLY 13.7 billion years in the
aking. Practically told everybody and their mother, that somebody had been in the process, of ATTEMPTING
o commit the ultimate sin against HIM... But- they failed.

Yeah, the real story is... that dramatic after all. Probably moreso.
Didn’t know it was HIS car, until he got into it, many moments later.

I approached the laundromat see (1) tall dude texting someone, not the same guy (pretty sure it’s not Kid 1). 
There is also a girl inside, they didn’t appear to be together

I believe I recorded them in the video, but I’m not certain... I walk back toward Computer Answers.
Then, Kid 2 comes out from Grecian Gardens area.
Attempted to get kinda close to me with his own sharp lookin’ dildo (knife), had music playing.

He was definitely trying to distract me, but it didn’t work - wasn’t foolin’ me. 
Kid 2 (description): white, ~25-30 Y.O., glasses, hat, open mesh-like satchel, visible items in satchel  
mobile battery charger, Bluetooth speaker, neon-light (similar to bicyclist @ end of IMG_0416/Orenda Ex.Trail) 

Basically everything you could get with a standard-issue douchebag starter-pack. I don’t want to offend any
douchebags though... these dudes were a lot worse.

Kid 2 goes into laundromat... they start talking or something, trying to look mad inconspicuous, that fails.
The reason why that “technique” fails so often, is a lot how like I know when my children lie to me.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Basically just as obvious. 
My daughter never understood “HOW DOES DAD ALWAYS KNOW...?”
...cause I wrote the damn book on how to lie, sweetheart. 
It’s not as cool as the book about the truth.

Same thing with my son. “OoOoOOOoooOohhHhh DAD... *lip starts to quiver...* I’M NOT LYING...”
...yeah you are. *points to corner* In the corner buddy. 

And he’d just pout, and cry... and say “I HATE YOU~!”
                  ____________________________________________________________________________
                  | ...well kid, you can HATE me all you want...? But, I’ll ALWAYS love you. | 
                  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                   Pamela Sicko said that, and it stuck with me.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Still recording video by the way... It was one long continuous video.

Eventually, Kid 1 knows he’s been caught on VIDEO, so he tries to FORCIBLY leave “inconspicuously”, 
but leaves parking lot while being recorded on video in his black Dodge...
(^ Thought it was a Charger, it may have been the Dart I later found at 1134 New Scotland Road) 
...headed south on Route 9 past Walmart, driving REAL fast, to the area where GT Toys is... 
...before driving out of sight.

Then, Kid 2 runs out of laundromat, cause now he’s like “Hey buddy~! What’s the big idea...?”
Well, fuckface, the idea is that I’m smarter than you fucks. Pretty sure that’s when I ended the recording.

I didn’t realize that the reason why my story sounded so difficult to believe that whole entire time, is
LITERALLY because, I’m the first person in recorded history to have captured these fuckin’ dudes.

I don’t know, I’m probably NOT, at all. But- I have to consider that people just find it difficult to believe,
cause maybe I’m far more intelligent than people think I am. Seriously, it’s the best way I can explain it.

All the shit in this story, tells me that I had key pieces of evidence that were being ignored because, 
nobody ever decided that a no-handed, no-faced, nobody can’t hand you lemons. OoooOOoohhHHhh... 
Then I gotta tell other people:
“It is logic like THAT, which I’m sure OTHER people have ALSO had, right...? But- they’re rare.”

The big idea was that this is the 3rd video I have now recorded, catching these dudes doing some shit.
Neither of them were in either of the other (2) videos, but they’re part of a group.
                 _______________________
They’re gonna do | EVERYTHING POSSIBLE |, to prevent me from showing other people the video.
                 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Unfortunately for them...? (1) dude with an NYSP badge saw the fuckin’ thing. 
Not the whole thing, but he saw the most important part.

So, that’s when he starts following me.
I think about uploading the video but, there is not nearly enough time to do that, at all. 
I made it to about HALFMOON SANDWICH AND SUB SHOP, I call 911... timer rising, no sound. 

Coincidence? Not at all. Only if you’re an idiot, would you assume that.

So, (2) guys now on foot no more than 50 feet away. 
Thought about running but I knew I would run out of steam and they’d catch up. 

I say “go some other way”, Kid 1: “Nah my car is THIS way.” 
After like 5 coincidences in a row, it’s no sense of paranoia at all, it’s them attempting to kill me.
Damn certain of it... SO DAMN CERTAIN OF IT, that there’s ADDITIONAL coincidences further down.

They were trying to catch up with me, and I knew that trying to run would be a fuckin’ REAL stupid move.
Cause I’d run out of steam.

So, I had a feeling “this is not looking good”, I walked in front of AAA just to HOPEFULLY leave trace evidence 
that I was there at all... and kept going. 

They were on the other side of the street, but they were STILL following me.
Trooper Carter should probably consider reading this story sometime.

I called 911 in front of CENTER FOR SECURITY for the 2nd time, while the camera out in front of their business, 
recorded FOOTAGE, of me 1) DIALING 911, AND 2) PRESSING THE SEND BUTTON, cause then 3) my phone didn’t reach 911.
That’s an oversight on behalf of 1) SCSO, and 2) NYSP, and even 3) the FBI.
                                 -------      -------           ----------
There is 0.00% chance WHATSOEVER, that a fuckin’ place called “Center for Security” didn’t see the POST-IT NOTE 
that I left on my birthday that said “Security Engineer”, AND, wouldn’t have GOOD security equipment recording.
            --------------           -------------------       -----------------------------------------------
                               _______________________________________________
Cause then it SHOULD be called | SOMETIMES I’M A LOCKSMITH, GO FUCK YOURSELF | instead of CENTER FOR SECURITY
                               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯            -------------------
But, hey. Morons actually exist. I’m not suggesting that their security cameras were running, or that they even
know how to look at camera footage, or set up DIGITAL ALARM PANELS THAT CALL 911 FOR YA IF SOMEONE BREAKS IN,
such as ADT, or like a billion others. Yeah. Normally, that’s what they fucking do... isn’t it...?

But on this particular date, they had a dildo in the ass, and they SOMEHOW got away with that missing chapter
where someone managed to survive. So like, we’re talkin’, everyone in the Town of Clifton Park somehow having 
no idea whatsoever, that these guys are morons. The guys at CENTER FOR SECURITY probably ARE very smart...

But they’re not fuckin’ smart at all compared to me... cause those fucks are involved in:

    1) attempted murder
    2) asking SCSO/MICHAEL ZURLO/JAMES LEONARD for help 
    3) home invasions
    4) use of PEGASUS/PHANTOM
    5) them fucks are extremely criminal
    6) they’re dangerous too
    7) probably the fact that the footage was not there

Basically, what I’m saying, is that there’s a very large scam going on involving these dudes, in CLIFTON PARK, 
and TANSKI, and CATRICALA, and ZURLO, and BORDEN probably, and dare I say it, HOFFMAN. Might also be PICKETT*’s.
    ------      ---------      -----      ------                              -------                -------
I think my aunt TERRI and RYAN are in on it too. And Judge ROBERT RYBAK. And, Judge LESTER WORMUTH. 
                -----     ----     ------------      ------------------       --------------------
I really don’t think Judge JAMES HUGHES is involved in this AT ALL.
         ---------------------------------------------------------
I just need to catch them (1) more time, which believe it or not, is a lot easier than people think.

My battery was about dead after I tried calling 911 at CENTER FOR SECURITY.

I took (3) pictures of these (2) kids walking in front of the bowling alley, with DIGITAL ZOOM. 
Not great resolution at all, but it is what it is.

They walked from the front of the Mitsubishi dealership through the bowling alley parking lot, and BEHIND the 
HOFFMAN CAR WASH (HOFFMAN*). I had a really bad feeling about staying on Route 9. 
I had a feeling that the EVIL police were waiting, like SCSO SCHELLING. Something gave me a bad fucking feeling.
                         ------------------------       --------------                      -------------------
So, I cut through Aldi/Lowes. 
                  ----------
Walking through the area SLOWLY. 10 minutes later, these SAME (2) kids came into the Lowe’s parking lot from 
the Pizza Hut/Fortune Wok entrance... MAGICALLY, they had ANOTHER car parked in the Lowes Home Improvement 
parking lot... where Tati and Sam used to park their car. 
                     ----     ---         --------------

Holy shit, coincidence...? IS THAT... a coinky-dink? Nah. I mean, it probably would be, if I was a fuckin’ moron.
...like LAURA HUGHES. Or KRISTIN JOHNSON. Ya know...? Wouldn’t wanna offend a couple of women that get paid to 
have integrity and do a job, right...? Pretty hard to do when nobody ever takes my fucking statement.

IN ONE OF THE AUDIO RECORDINGS... that I uploaded to my Google Drive account, from the “network I didn’t have to
hack at all”, I said TATIANA CLEVELAND’s name, as well as RYAN’s. Why...? Oh. Probably cause it felt like history, 
repeating itself somehow. THIS TIME HOWEVER... I would be a lot more WISE than I once was... 

They knew to park that car there ahead of time. So like, they somehow KNEW I’d say something about INNISBROOK.
                                 -------------                        ----     ------------------------------
COOL THING IS, how could they have been listening to me on a device with no service and SOMEHOW...

MIRACULOUSLY, unexpectedly, coincidentally (only if you’re a fuckin’ dumbass) 
12 hours earlier I walked to my aunt TERRI’s house, AFTER coincidentally running into JOHN HOFFMAN with my son, 

Just so we’re clear here, a lot of coincidences in a row like that is called a “PATTERN”
The police should really STUDY what these things are, sometime. 
THAT MANY COINCIDENCES in a row, IS NOT COINCIDENTAL AT ALL, AND TROOPER CARTER SHOULD REALLY STUDY THIS SHIT.

I spoke about the “Zodiac Killer”. That motherfucker has never been caught, even though they sure as hell think
so, don’t they?

They knew to park their car there somehow. 
They heard what I was saying as I made those recordings. 
I KNOW that my cousin RYAN WARN has DIRECT INVOLVEMENT with this event. 
            ------------------------------------------
And, has direct involvement with MEGHAN ALEXANDER’s robbery back in (2011/2012) in Hillside Trailer Park. 
         --------------------------------------------------
I believe Ryan was involved with the cyberattack at Computer Answers on January 15th, 2019. 
          ----     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, the easiest way I can put it is that I should somehow be awarded a position where I am given the job,
of being the local FBI director. Not even remotely fucking kidding. Cause how the hell would the local FBI
director miss ALL of these details? OooOOooOoOOoohhhhHHhhhh, could be cause that dude’s a fuckin’ moron/involved.

Or, the FBI could actually be a criminal organization, with the opposite of integrity. Every case they handle?
Might actually be crimes THEY ARE THE ONES COMMITTING. Basically, nobody is free, everyone’s a slave. Maybe not.

And, RYAN is dangerous, more dangerous than that director, for every day of the week.
And, he’s done this to other people under that dudes nose, and never gets caught.
THEY have. 

TATI probably knows, and there’s a pretty damn good reason why.

After I saw them get in their car, I lost my shit because that’s basically them showing that they knew something
that I WOULD THINK, and hadn’t YET actually thought. Then again, maybe they just got lucky.
They were expecting me a dozen different ways.

Eventually after I thought the coast was clear, I walked out of the Lowe’s parking lot, and then they tried 
to run me over on Route 146. They missed me, I tried to run up to catch their license plate... couldn’t read it.


I stood around the intersection for a moment because I was trying to flag somebody down. 
I did start running at cars. Cause I knew they were playing this fucking game where I needed to get something
on an official 911 record SOMEHOW. SCSO-2020-028501. Yeah, it’s not uh, a shock to me that MAYBE THE NYSP...
...was waitin’ for me. But I doubt it. It feels more like (FBI/SCSO Schelling), might’ve been somebody else...?
but I doubt it.

Then, I powered the phone back on or perhaps it remained on. I said something into my phone, wasn’t recording 
anything. “You idiots didn’t know that I had a second cell phone...?” Ah, they didn’t have that MAC Address.
So, these dudes were actually shitting bricks, and sending each other details about what happened.

However, I was ALSO shitting bricks being careful where I fuckin’ went cause... holy shit I had a real high 
confidence that after 12 coincidental things happened in a row, they could’ve had guys in each fuckin’ direction.

    - Cemetery Road...?    Dead.
    - Cut through cemetery into stone quarry...? Dead.
    - Stone quarry...?     Dead.
    - Driving range...?    Dead.
    - 5 Chelsea Place...?  Dead. 
    - Glass road...?       The most dead. 
    - Oakbrook Commons...? Dead.

A guy at 1 Fern Lane, gave me a look one day, that caused me to think that the road felt fuckin’ dangerous.
Normally, I’d just fuckin’ walk on through, no problem. But I know when somebody’s watching me. And that
dude was fuckin’ watching me alright. When combined with the sense of PEOPLE BEING IN THE CAMPER in the yard of the 
house closest to the Feiden Appliance Center...? 

I was terrified to do anything else, other than to get INTO A 911 record SOMEHOW. 
And, it’s a good thing my phone was actually dead, otherwise they would’ve just moved in.
                                        
The reason that I KNOW as such, is literally because they had mapped out my telemetry, using a phone with... 
no service.

THAT is the REAL reason why I cut the PHONE LINE, and the KAYAK STRAP at 1769 Route 9, Clifton Park, NY.
Cause, they were in that motherfuckin’ camper. Cause I heard the sound of a little birdie being there a couple
nights prior. When I say “little birdie” what I mean is, a security drone. Sounds like a bird, haven’t seen it.
I know when I fuckin’ hear this thing. I still occasionally hear it. There’s a VERY CLEAR DIFFERENCE in the way 
this thing SOUNDS, than any normal bird in the world.

Anyway, maybe nobody was anywhere, and the 12 coincidences that occurred that day, they were all unrelated...
...one perfectly shaped puzzle piece after another. 

Nah, I know that the kids that parked in Lowes, had been either IN THAT HOUSE, or they were IN THAT CAMPER.

Might’ve been totally unrelated people just standing around in Karel’s residence. 
So when I heard them walking around, they didn’t bother to call 911 or anything... 
Cause, maybe the phone line sorta scared the shit out of them. “Abort mission”, “Abort mission”... 
They walked from window to window...
They were turning the air conditioners off to hear where I was.

Guy2 : I dunno, turn the AC off...
Guy1 : *turns AC off*
Guy2 : Dude, I’m fuckin’ terrified right now, bro.
Guy1 : How the fuck did this guy even know we were here...?
Guy2 : Literally all eyes that were on him, they lost him. 
       Now the fuckin’ phone line is down.            
       This guy is a fucking expert.
Guy1 : He can’t be, Agent Ward told us.
Guy2 : Dude, how does this fuckin’ dude know our game plan...?
Guy1 : I don’t know, but call SCSO and have Schelling move in.
       *opens radio channel* Everybody, stand down, and abort mission. 
       I repeat, stand down and abort mission.
Guy2 : This dude literally caught us red handed...
       What the fuck are we gonna do, bro...?

I did see some vehicles driving around, one of those vehicles was... ROBERT MASSINA.
He’s like a guy I used to work for in 2014. Maybe it wasn’t him though, just kinda resembled him a bit.
The many times I’d see his vehicle, maybe it wasn’t him.

Maybe I was right about all this other stuff, but then I was paralyzed with fear because they were using a really
dangerous program to figure out where I was, or would go.

Before Schelling showed up, however... I was convinced that MATCHLESS STOVE AND CHIMNEY was also somewhat 
of a red herring... OR, maybe it wasn’t one at all. It had an active power plan.

After I severed ZACKARY KAREL’s phone line, I had a BAD feeling NOT to go anywhere near that fuckin’ camper.

So, I was able to move the sign for the embroidery shop across the street, and then just get rid of the things 
they taped on top. I literally, didn’t steal the thing, I just moved it across the street onto a VACANT MAILBOX 
POLE for 1774 Route 9... MATCHLESS STOVE AND CHIMNEY. You gotta figure, a missing mailbox at a STORE that is 
constantly empty, that maybe it’s not a store, it’s an operation. MAYBE. Possible. Could’ve legitimately appeared
to be some people SQUATTING in there, with those people being serial killers. Or maybe, everybody’s a serial 
killer, bro. I’m not special, cause serial killers are everywhere, and I’m ridiculous to think that I almost 
caught a couple of really important and stealthy ones...

Nah. I had so many fuckin’ clues it’s unbelievable to think the police are professionals at anything except eatin’ 
fuckin’ donuts. And, lying. However, that’s not a consistent thing by any means. Maybe a lot of the ones that I 
run into, weren’t trained by an actual expert that knows what they’re doing. Some of them deserve a lot more respect 
and recognition than people think, and SHAEMUS LEAVEY is one of those dudes. I’ll talk about him shortly.

Schelling was the first on scene. The guys that were ABOUT to kill me, maybe they all took off.

Maybe they HAD an operation in Park Manor, and Karel’s “residence”... and my fuckin’ Facebook post where I posted 
an actual picture of a hotel...? With no cars ever there...? Russians and stuff...? That- probably pissed em off.
You gotta figure, these guys are all getting paid no less than `$50-100/hr, and all it took to fuck up their entire
operation, was cutting (1) fucking phone line. That’s it.

So, instead of me getting taken out by a team of about 10 people that all get paid `$50-100/hr, they all were
fooled by a guy like me, who doesn’t have a badge, isn’t paid a single dime, and somehow, outsmarted ALL of them. 
One way or another, it’s a fuckin’ total waste of somebody’s money to try and outsmart me. 
I survived because a little birdie saved my fuckin’ life and gave me some hints and clues.

As for Schelling, his objective, was to murder me... BUT- because he didn’t know what I LOOKED like, AND, too 
much time had gone by for him to make the correlation between the event near Key Bank, and the event at Zappone... 
he wasn’t able to readily identify me at all. And therefore, the entire team was blindsided on ‘accident’ again.

Uh-oh. There I go again... fuckin’, ‘accidentally’ fucking up every bad guys day/life...

Scott Schelling referenced something that I said into my device that wasn’t recording anything. That’s how I know
these fucks were tracking me and trying to kill me. I can’t say that THEY ALL do this... But he is one of the 
people that somehow knew what the hell I was even saying into a device that wasn’t recording anything.

And the reason I know this is as follows...

SCSO-2020-028501: SCOTT SCHELLING is the first on scene. 
I was actually fuckin’ terrified until I saw this dude, SCOTT SCHELLING arrive on scene. 
I had run up to the Lamar Advertising billboard, and pulled the tag off of one of the boxes, 
the tab said “Security”, and, then I pulled a module out so that it would trigger an alarm.

That isn’t why he was there at that time, however. 
He came from the direction of Dunkin Donuts, believe it or not... Priceless. He turned his lights on, 
pulled a U-turn, and parked his vehicle right on the side of the road in front of Zappone. 

When he got out, I had my hands up, wasn’t pulling any funny business, 
and I told him that I tried to call 911 about 90 minutes beforehand TWICE.

Schelling : You obviously didn’t call 911 otherwise WE would’ve gotten the call...
Me        : I have like, screenshots of the calls and the call log.
Schelling : Look dude, what the hell is this...?
Me        : It’s a security tag.
Schelling : Buddy, I’m about to give YOU a security tag in a second... 
Me        : Why...?
Schelling : Were you runnin’ into the road and stuff...?
Me        : I was running alongside the road, trying to wave people down for help.
Schelling : Well, why would you do something like that...?
Me        : Cause some dudes were trying to kill me.
Schelling : Doesn’t make any sense, dude.
            You’re probably on drugs right now, aren’t ya?
Me        : No.
            *Kaplan and Welch arrive together*

            Look at what we have here pal.
            Buddy, now’s the time to come clean and tell me the truth.
Me        : I did.

            Alright...

Kaplan    : WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE...? *adjusts belt*
Schelling : Dude says that he was almost killed by a couple guys, tried to call 911.
Kaplan    : Alright.

            You know how many times I’ve heard that before...?
Me        : A lot...?
Kaplan    : *nods* Yeah buddy.
            Everybody says that they almost got killed by a couple guys, and tried to call 911.
            If you called 911, how come we don’t know about it...?
            *didn’t know about Pegasus/Phantom*
Me        : Uh, I think my phone was being jammed or something.
Kaplan    : BRO. 
            I will fuck you up right now... you understand me...?
            Ain’t no two guys tried to kill ya...
            Ain’t made no 911 calls...
            Ain’t no record that you called for help...
            What the hell are ya doin’...?
Me        : Nah, all of that shit is true, buddy.
Schelling : Hey, buddy, chill out a bit.
Kaplan    : Yeah...?
Schelling : Yeah, he might be tellin’ the truth.
            Come over this way buddy, empty your pockets and stuff on the (front/back) of this cruiser.
Me        : Alright. *empty pockets*
Schelling : I’m gonna hang onto your knife here.
Me        : Fine. 
            That’s it anyway.
Schelling : So, is this the phone...?
Me        : Yeh.
Kaplan    : Dude, we got numerous complaints about some lunatic jumping in front of cars and stuff...
            ...the last couple hours.
            I’m fixin’ to arrest your ass...
Me        : Look man, some dudes were following me and I even recorded a video of them chasing me.
Schelling : Yeah...?
Me        : Yeah.
Kaplan    : Look buddy...
            If you don’t convince either one of us that you were trying to call for help, we’re arrestin’ ya.
Schelling : You got your ID or license on ya, bub...?
Kaplan    : Perfect idea.
Me        : Here ya go. *hands to Schelling*
Schelling : *looks at it, his entire demeanor changes immediately* This is...
            ...the dude who walked to Stratton the other night, and got shut down at the gate.
Kaplan    : *swaps roles with Scott, begins being respectful toward me* Holy hell, no kiddin’...
Schelling : *doesn’t run my ID* Listen chum, come here. 
            Gonna sit down. 
            *sits in his driver seat* Let’s see what’s on your phone.
Me        : *attempting to power it on...* I need to charge it. 
            It’s dead.
Schelling : *started getting pissy with me now* Look dude. 
            You need to bring that thing to me with it powered up.
Me        : Kinda hard to do, do you have a cable...?
Schelling : No. *stands up*
            Look buddy, you’ve got (2) options.
            (1) I arrest you right now, and you just get locked up.
Me        : For what...?
Schelling : For basically running in the road flagging people down for help.
            You can’t PROVE that you called 911 at all.
            Can ya...?
Me        : If my device was charged I could.
Schelling : Look, that’s not an option right now.
            Either I arrest you now, and you go to jail...
            Or... 
            (2) I just drive your ass home, and that’ll be the end of it.
            *I felt a strong sense of this dude looking for any reason at all to bring me to the jail*
Me        : I live in that neighborhood *points* right there though.
Schelling : Not an option dude.
            *at this point I’m fuckin’ terrified again* 
            *because I have a feeling that he’s trying to route me into jail...*
            *cause he finally knows I’m the guy he was tasked with watching out for*
Me        : If this guy right here follows you to my house, I’ll go with that option.
Kaplan    : Who, me...?
Me        : Yeah, you. *cause something seemed fuckin’ wrong about Schelling getting me SOMEWHERE alone*
Kaplan    : Alright, fine.
Schelling : *opens rear door of his vehicle* Get in.
            *I get in*
Schelling : *Starts driving, very quiet the whole way*
            *When getting closer to Snyders, I saw multiple vehicles that appeared to be familiar.*
            *I had a hunch that other people were involved, but, who...?*
            *Schelling arrives in my driveway, walks around to the passenger side rear door*
            *won’t quite let me out*
            *Kaplan in the vehicle behind us, not involved in the questions Schelling asks me*

I was about to have the final conversation I needed to make it through, in order to remain alive.
I didn’t trust this guy one fuckin’ bit. 

He wasn’t outright trying to arrest me, but it was pretty obvious he’d really prefer to bring me to jail.
The dude literally gave me the OPTION of being arrested.

Pretty sure no one in their right mind throughout history has ever said: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

         Being arrested and brought to jail...? 
         Fuck yeah, dude. 
         That’s *points at chest* MY idea of FUN. Ha.
         See how much YOU like it when I’m willing to be thrown in jail, heh.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Yeah, no one in their right mind ever says that.
I had a feeling that he wanted to <destroy my phone>, which would’ve eliminated a LOT of evidence, but not the 
audio recordings. Why...? I have a feeling that he knew, I was the guy he was waiting for, near Key Bank. 
Maybe I’m wrong about that... but it sure as shit felt like it. 

That’s why I took about a half hour in the Lowes parking lot. 
Because I had a feeling that in every direction, I was fucked. 

The lights in the Lowes parking lot were sorta goin’ bad, and they were FLASHING... felt like a BAD OMEN.

With all this shit I already survived, having no idea that I was nearly trapped, and killed... 
...this conversation gave me an adrenaline rush that I’ll never forget. I had to play it off.

Me        : No.

            I got in front of the camera at Center for Security.
            I dialed 911 and hit send within like 10 inches of that camera out front.
            [I am certain that footage is there, and they could corroborate my story*].

            I’m gonna come back here and arrest your ass.
Me        : I’m not.
Schelling : *stares at me for a minute, I could see in his eyes, he failed his mission*

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Hey, I’ll have to look into this situation a lot more on the legal side, but it looks like obstruction of justice
all day long. Then it dives deeply into ignoring SOME evidence, destroying OTHER evidence, and then FABRICATING
evidence, of 2x 911 TDoS (Telephony Denial of Service)... looks like facilitation of an attempted murder.

As for this PARTICULAR incident, COOPER does not appear to be involved, neither does PIRRONE...
Although, I’m certain that LEONARD, ZURLO, nor SCHELLING actually had anything to do with the 911 calls failing
to make it to dispatch... the fact is, someone destroyed evidence at CENTER FOR SECURITY, AND on my device.
______________________________________________________________
| 2) SCHELLING: Tell me more about these 911 calls you made. |

So, I realize that the official investigators at SCSO, probably don’t realize that a guy who works there
named A. AGRESTA, could CORROBORATE my story as it relates to the SECOND entry on this list.

However, A. AGRESTA won’t be able to provide any details as to the MAKE or MODEL of the BLUE TRUCK that
was STALKING ME, HIM, and HIS PARTNER that showed up on 05/19/20 on SITTERLY ROAD, about 30 minutes 
AFTER incident... 
___________________________________________________________________________
| [Incident:SCSO-2020-002998/HILDRETH]: A. AGRESTA, S. LYONS, J. HILDRETH |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
AGRESTA : Dispatch to a phys. domestic incident at 201 Halfmoon Circle, T/O Halfmoon.

MICHAEL STREETER reports that a dispute with his adult step-son, MICHAEL COOK,
turned physical resulting in COOK punching STREETER in the back of the head.

The two then began to wrestle and COOK attempted to place STREETER in a headlock.
However, STREETER prevented it. At no time was STREETER choked, nor were COOK’s (hands/arms)
around STREETER neck. STREETER state he had no injuries and denied EMS. 
STREETER appeared to be highly intoxicated. 
Deputy S. LYONS and Sgt. HILDRETH arrived on-scene shortly after.

The truth is, I told my stepfather that someone in a BLUE TRUCK was STALKING ME, and then he LAUGHED AT ME, and 
then I ASSAULTED HIM, and then I also put him into a HEADLOCK, because he was EXTREMELY intoxicated. I wasn’t 
trying to kill the guy, he was acting irrational and not taking me seriously. Love ya dad (asshole).

So, the moral of the story is that I KNEW I WAS BEING HUNTED. WHEN ASKING FOR HELP...? “OH. FUCK YOU DUDE.”

I know not everybody will bother listening to ALL of these AUDIO LOGS, because I already know that what was SAID 
in the recordings MATTERS A LOT LESS THAN THE TIMESTAMPS OF THESE FILES. As in, uploaded with content that is
ESSENTIALLY IRRELEVANT. Though, TO BE CLEAR, the CONTENT of these AUDIO RECORDINGS is DEFINITELY NOT IRRELEVANT.
That probably sounds like a CONTRADICTION.

Allow me to make myself perfectly fucking clear for people who are as retarded as DWAYNE COONRADT…
I am [NOT CONTRADICTING MYSELF AT ALL*], but RETARDED PEOPLE will ASSUME that is what I’m doing right now. 

So, to CLARIFY for RETARDED PEOPLE like DWAYNE COONRADT… I WAS PISSING (EXPERTS/PEOPLE) OFF THAT HAD MY DEVICE HACKED.

IT WAS HACKED FOR WELL OVER A WEEK AT THIS POINT…? AND, I HAD EVERY INTENTION OF JUST CONTINUING TO RECORD WHATEVER 
CAME TO MIND, WITH THE SOLE INTENTION OF PISSING THESE PEOPLE OFF. IT WORKED A LITTLE TOO WELL TO BE PERFECTLY CLEAR.
THAT MEANS -> I SAID SOME THINGS THAT MANIPULATED THESE PEOPLE INTO ATTACKING ME.

How’s that sound for all the retarded people that think like DWAYNE COONRADT…? Made myself perfectly clear…? Good.

I uploaded all (3) of these files from the Clifton Park Computer Answers network, as I stated, many times.

But also, I took pictures of the network WHILE I was attached to the network.
In one of those audio recordings, I say “I’m gonna break into the network...” But the cool thing is, I already
had the fuckin’ password and was ALREADY CONNECTED TO IT. That’s when these dickheads attempted to attack me.

The image above with the 911 calls, I took that picture AFTER Scott Schelling released me from his vehicle.
Here’s the ones from BEFORE that...

| [0010-0016] – These are the pictures I took BEFORE I started recording the video that NYSP SHAEMUS LEAVEY,  | 
| as well as my DAUGHTER, and SON saw. They are me (admittedly trespassing on his property), taking pictures  |
| because I heard something in the woods behind the building. So, I thought someone was back there. There’s   |
| a bone sitting on the inside of the window, and Trooper Borden has seen all of these pictures before.       |

Here are the pictures I took AFTER the video IMG_0647... (the video I’ve already described)

| [0001]: The missing video. This (1) piece of evidence, would’ve saved me from having to write this entire   |
| fucking document, as well as losing my children and having the community treat me like I don’t know what    |

| [0002]: Screenshot AFTER I FIRST called 911, near the Clifton Park Eye Center next to Grecian Gardens.      | 
| [0003-0005]: 2x 25-to-30-year-old white males, wearing backwards hats, backpacks, they were aggressively    | 
| stalking me to the degree where I really feel like smacking Trooper Carter across his fuckin’ face dozens   | 
| of times for thinking that these kids weren’t trying to kill me. They definitely were.                      |
| [0006]: The screenshot I posted above, of the call log. I wasn’t using this device to make phone calls.     | 
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Once I noticed that there was some shit going down out in Bennington, I stopped paying for the service on my 
phone, because I was doing something a lot more important than everyone thought I was doing. When I say that,
I realize some people will get offended and scoff IMMEDIATELY when I say that... But, it is the truth.

Sorry if I am LITERALLY making the local police look incredibly INCOMPETENT with this whole document...
My bad bro, sorry I’m actually a better investigator than most of you people... would’ve never had my kids 
taken away or gotten myself thrown in jail for (20) days, if assholes like KRISTIN JOHNSON, LAURA HUGHES,
SARAH SCHELLINGER, JOHN DELONG, PAUL PELAGALLI actually LISTENED TO ME, and LOOKED AT MY “SUPPORTING EVIDENCE”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
06/13/20 | ^ EVIDENCE that went IGNORED DIRECTLY CAUSED → SCREAMING MATCHES WITH MY MOTHER AND STEPFATHER → 
WILLIAM MOAK → TOLD ME TO SHUT THE FUCK UP CAUSE EVERYONE THOUGHT I WAS ANNOYING ASSHOLE WHO FABRICATES SHIT 
OUT OF THIN AIR → I TOLD HIM TO SHUT THE FUCK UP INSTEAD → JANET MOAK MADE HAND PUPPET GESTURES AND SAID I’M 
ALL TALK AND NO ACTION → I CALLED HER A CUNT → BILL SAID THROUGH HIS WINDOW “I’M GONNA KILL YA” → THEN HE 
GRABBED BASEBALL BAT → RAN ONTO MY PROPERTY → HIT THE SIDE OF HIS HOUSE WITH BAT LEAVING A DENT → RAN AT ME 
ON MY PROPERTY NEAR MY PORCH → HIS WIFE JANET + MY STEP FATHER MICHAEL STREETER HELD HIM FROM SWINGING THE 
BASEBALL BAT AT ME NEAR MY PORCH/LILAC BUSH → I CALLED 911 BECAUSE I WASN’T HAVING A MENTAL EPISODE AT ALL 
and REPORTED THE INCIDENT → I TELL MARK SHEEHAN THAT RUSSIANS AND US GOV’T HACKING MY EQUIPMENT + CENSORING 
MY SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS → MARK SHEEHAN TAKES EVERYONES STATEMENT BUT MINE → BRINGS ME TO SARATOGA HOSPITAL → 
RICHARD TODD LOEBER IGNORES MY EVIDENCE AS WELL → COMMITS MEDICAL FRAUD WHILE ACCUSING ME OF BEING BIPOLAR 
SCHIZOPHRENIC IN 5 MINUTES WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE BY THE WAY → NEVER READ A DSM5 → NEVER LOOKED AT EVIDENCE → 
HUH...? Wow. Somewhere along this entire trajectory, people accuse me of something I’m not, COOL. 

I have recorded evidence, but that’s ignored. COOL.
I tell people that doubt my evidence “exists” that they’re a fuckin’ moron or a cunt, THAT’S NOT COOL. 
That’s why I get fucking aggravated with people, cause I wouldn’t call someone a cunt for making hand puppets
after my FBI AGENT COUSIN AND HIS FRIENDS ATTEMPTED TO MURDER ME AND HAD MICHAEL ZURLO AND JAMES LEONARD 
COVER UP THE CRIME THAT THEY COMMITTED. WOW. (← This is why I lose my patience with people)

So people can fuckin’ commit crimes against me over and over, and never get CHARGED with anything, right...?
Oh, but if I tell BRUCE TANSKI he’s lucky I haven’t broken his legs yet, he’ll CRY ABOUT IT  (← DEFINITELY INVOLVED)
Or, I tell JOHN HOFFMAN to suck a fuckin’ dick, he’s gonna keep committing FRAUD/BRIBE CPS   (← DEFINITELY INVOLVED)
Or, I tell ERIC CATRICALA that he should stop throwing dead bodies into concrete             (← DEFINITELY INVOLVED)
...MOAK will strike me with his BASEBALL BAT ON MY PROPERTY | ← Why I’m more intelligent than most people

Look. All that stuff is gonna be difficult to read later on. Do I have “concrete” evidence that they’re involved?
Uh, no, but the video I showed Trooper Leavey was the closest fucking thing I had to being “concrete”.  
I have a VISUAL INDICATION that there’s a CORRELATION by MISSING DETAILS making my SUSPICIONS...
...a lot more OBVIOUS and BLATANT. Yeah, it’s hard to prove things by things being OMITTED, but when they’re
OMITTED or NO ACTION IS TAKEN, it is a very clear indication that somebody prefers to be seen as “squeaky clean”

As for the STATEMENT THAT SCOTT SCHELLING DID NOT WRITE...? I don’t know if my device was powered on, when 
I left the Lowes parking lot. I know that they pulled out of the Lowes parking lot and tried to hit me with 
their 2nd car, as in MULTIPLE VEHICLES WERE USED. I know that it was close to dead at this point. At Key Bank,
multiple vehicles drove through the intersection and I was running at every vehicle I saw to get SOMEONE TO 
CALL 911 BECAUSE MY (2) PRIOR ATTEMPTS FAILED. Said into my device that wasn’t actually RECORDING anything: 
“You fucks didn’t know I had a second Mac Address/phone...?” ...it was a bluff that probably saved my life.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What I felt right there and then was the most disgusting feeling I’ve ever felt in my whole life.
Though for reasons I couldn’t fully comprehend... 
...this situation was the most traumatic event I’ve ever lived through.
Yeah, my father being murdered was pretty bad.
But I started to feel as if someone had been watching me my whole life AFTER murdering my father...
...and they just tried to get my ass too. (← CERTAINTY)

Scott made no effort to wait for me to go get my charge cable.
Never took a statement or anything.
He may have failed his mission, but he succeeded at preventing me from being able to take action against my 
opponents, and that dude could’ve looked at the fucking video that I wound up showing to Trooper Leavey.

At least I survived... barely.

I immediately begin to extract evidence from my phone and upload what I can to the internet. 

I made a post on Facebook and immediately got a 30 day ban. ← Facebook’s involvement. Yeah, I violated Community
Standards by saying a slur, but- I was actually almost killed and I was pretty sure that the military was in fact,
recording the entire interaction that I had with Scott Schelling. 

They had been like, recording me because I kept doin’ stuff that people don’t typically do, not unless they walk 
to Stratton Air National Guard to report that somebody’s using technology to kill people. 
Oh well, they know. Don’t they?

I uploaded as much as I could from my phone. I waited until it was someone well lit outside so that I wouldn’t
catch a knife to the neck, I had a clue that I was being tracked with the phone, but I brought it with me anyway.
I don’t think I ever actually went anywhere onto Zackary Karel’s property ANYWHERE CLOSE to 0530/0545 as 
SCSO James Leonard would later have his grunts report in 2020-003177 which wouldn’t be filed for another 
28 hours. Apparently some people were calling the police because I was going from property to property trying
to figure out if these dipshits were breaking into OTHER people’s houses. I don’t know what the story is with
1769 Route 9, but a vehicle was in the driveway and didn’t move for well over a year, maybe even 2. I had a
suspicion that maybe the people in that building, were killed. And, nobody needed to move that car at all.

I never found answers for that, but I wasn’t willing to wait around and KNOWINGLY allow these kids to start 
getting other people. I knew they tried to kill me. I was certain of it. I might’ve been acting “paranoid”, 
but when someone uses a fuckin’ advanced cyberattack like CVE-2019-8936 AND Ransomware, and THEN they use
something that even Apple doesn’t know exists (publicly), I had a real strong suspicion that they would use
the COVID lockdown as a prime opportunity to victimize other people too.

I looked for “patterns”, like pollen building up on cars that hadn’t moved, curtains in people’s windows that
stayed in the same position, or something as simple as maybe a garbage can that hadn’t moved, or mailbox with
the lid in the same position... I actually suspected that Matchless Stove n Chimney had people squatting cause 
it had active power.

I would later realize by working with Kenneth Yates, that his uncle was the marine that lives across the street
from Zackary Karel on Biette Road. I was worried about this dude because I occasionally walk all the way around 
the area and I noticed his vehicle hadn’t moved, blinds/curtains in the same position.  and that dude ALSO hangs 
out with Tim Krom a lot, who lives across the street from ME. Tim Krom is my best friend Nick Sicko’s dad. Nick, 
Pam, Jessie, and Tim Jr. have ALL lived there across the street from me. I’ve known them longer than Trooper 
Borden has been a Trooper. A lot longer. Nick and I used to go stealin’ golf balls and pissin’ off Astoia when 
we were kids, and Astoia caught us a few times and always let us go. Astoia was a cool dude.

LaQuinta Inn, Trooper Leavey came up to me behind the hotel. I think Tanski owns the property, and recently built 
a storage place for vehicles/RV’s. The security company that installed the controls that now exist at the gate, 
are the people who worked with (Kevin Birch – PTI Security), a guy I once did work with for DA Collins in Saratoga, 
and I think it’s the same company in Watervliet. 

I don’t remember what I said to Leavey in this interaction, but a 2nd Trooper came as well. Leavey told me to go 
home and “get sleep” after I was almost “murdered”. I think he took notes about that, but not sure. I think he
ALSO considered the idea that I would be like an “apprentice” or whatever, because I was investigating this shit.

I wasn’t ready to dump ALL my details and suspicions, because hey. Not even sure who the hell was trying to kill
me at that point. Leavey made it really obvious that he had just woken up, so, I knew there was NO fucking way, 
that he had ANYTHING to do with the attack AT ALL. Well, I can’t say NO way at all, if he was just ACTING like
he just woke up, or something. But, his attitude and demeanor was WAY too calm and collected for me to believe 
that he knew what the hell happened to me. NO RESISTANCE being the key observation.

I went home for a short while, but, something was preventing me from being able to sleep because of how stressed
out I was. Someone tries to kill you, let me tell ya. You’re not gonna fuckin’ wanna sleep at all.

I was too restless to just give up or give in. I thought maybe talking about the whole situation with a friend 
might be a good idea. Kinda forgot that I pissed off Amber’s family, but I still went there anyway. 

Bruce Tanski owns that business, Sunoco, and Roger was the manager at the store. Might not have direct involvement
with the scenario QUITE YET... but I’m not positive because I had made some other observations involving Tanski,
which is why I spoke to Eric Catricala about Kelly/Lester Wormuth, Bruce Tanski, Town of Halfmoon Supervisor, AND
Computer Answers/Dwayne Coonradt a couple days prior. (Pretty sure Tanski’s a cocksucker and WAS involved)

One of the pictures/videos I took (iPhone takes pictures that are ALSO short videos) of the cellphone tower on 
Solar Drive had a stagnant 0 on it. The video, shows a solid 0.00KwH … not a FLASHING 0.00KwH, but, stagnant. 
That means, that thing was getting free power, and offloading the cost to the OTHER paying customers nearest.
I know that’s what I was lookin’ at, still have that video by the way... I went to NYSEG and when I got there, 
(2) dudes were there. One was sitting at his desk in his little cubicle, checking invoices and emails, the other
stood with a red hat on, glasses, ~6’2”, and I banged on the window. They were tryin’ to ignore me. Dumb idea.
I fuckin’ kept doin that till the dudes heard me AND looked at me, and the one dude looked at me, held his hands
open like “what the fuck bro...?” and I’m trying to tell them to come to the fuckin’ door. 

The both of them come to the door, I can’t remember the exact words that were said, but I told him that I had 
EVIDENCE (still not collected yet by the way) that these fucks were giving people free power. As in, basically 
they may have been overcharging me for power when I lived in Mechanicville after I got terminated from 
Nfrastructure. But, I’m not gonna include that here. These guys were probably charging everybody for power, 
except CERTAIN people. If it’s a detail I should state, uh, NYSEG is across the street from Nfrastructure. 

Anyway, the thing that uses a shitload of power...? A cell phone tower that was within range of my device when 
I called 911 twice earlier that morning...? Oh, maybe the reason why neither one made it to the dispatch station,
is because those towers are busy getting free power from NYSEG. Cool...! That’s 2x Nikola Tesla technologies 
being stolen from dead man that died broke, who also just so happened to invent them, getting taxed... and not 
working during a murder attempt cause Zurlo’s a fuckin’ moron. 

That’s what the picture/video tells me, is that NYSEG can do that, because people will look at the shit I 
recorded, and they will look at me and say “there’s gotta be another explanation for this...”, but there isn’t.
EVEN IF SOMEONE WAS TOLD HOW TO CATCH THEM IN THE ACT... nobody will ever be intelligent enough to catch them.
Why...? It’s not like these people who play this game are idiots. People just take them at their word, AND,
they will not spend so much time and effort watching those meters like a hawk, because they make more money 
by sitting at U-Turns or accusing innocent people of abusing their children like Laura Hughes and SCSO Cooper do.

EVEN IF THEY CAUGHT THEM IN THE ACT, what can anybody do, arrest somebody...? Oh well. Another person will do it
too. Pretty sure people WOULD give a shit, if they knew that the video I recorded shows a dick being in somebody’s 
mouth. And I’m not talking about an actual dick being sucked on either. [Class Action Lawsuit - NYSEG]

After I told this guy that I knew they were giving certain people free power, he had a sad look on his face like 
“oh nos...”. So, this dude went right ahead, saw me walkin’ away, and then he probably called the police, said 
“Yeah, I’m a guy that works at GrayBar, not NYSEG. Some dude was just here tellin’ me some shit to my face bro.”
And then the police were dispatched, guess who that was...? Trooper Leavey. Leavey is not the problem here.

After I NEVER ACTUALLY WENT TO GRAYBAR, I went to Sunoco, owned by Bruce Tanski. Guy who somehow has a `$60M 
contract with a dude for “Kings Isle”, and who scammed by friend’s grandfather Mr. Dinova out of `$6K, and then
Mr. Tanski, did some criminal shit with a lot of people’s money and somehow threw the money right back into the
account like it was never even touched. Why is that...? Oh. Cause I think Bruce Tanski has a guy on the inside
at the fuckin’ bank. Wanna like, know what BANK that might be...? Key Bank, KeyCorp. I already explained the
details previously, Justin Belleville was doin’ some shit.

Maybe a guy that I spoke to Eric Catricala about, somehow does criminal shit all the time, and gets away with 
it constantly, cause he knows how to slip it in somebody’s butt and then bounce. [It’s all connected]

Roger wasn’t there, neither was Sharon, they moved. Oh well. Time to give up... Just, find the best rock 
I can, call myself a huge loser, and just crawl under it. Oh well. I lost, man. Apparently, the reason why 
my evidence has never been officially collected, is because I apparently haven’t rubbed a magic lantern with
a fuckin’ genie inside, and made a wish and said, “I wish somebody would help me file several lawsuits.”

After I left Halfmoon Sunoco, my intuition told me to check out the turkey vultures that were behind the gas 
station. I recorded a video back on May 18th or May 19th of (6) turkey vultures flying above Astoia Vucetics 
property. My friend Kris Wacikowski told me that they feed on CARRION, which means DEAD BODIES. 
So, if the AIR current, is pushing HOT AIR UP, and there’s DEAD BODIES NEARBY... that means those fucks 
will be there. Like, if you ask a hot girl if she wants to suck a big fat dick... she will hang out cause 
that’s what they like. Apply that concept to TURKEY VULTURES, and then that becomes a motivation for me to 
look through the area looking for fresh holes or dirt. Cause DIGGING. 
I didn’t SEE anything really noteworthy beyond a few trails and stuff. 

However, when I was up there, I had no idea that I was on a State Troopers property/land. I spent a while
recording audio, cause I had a feeling that I could manipulate the party that was listening to me on my 
device that had no service. Cause that’s a recurring theme here is, somebody’s able to see what I’m doin’, 
even if I don’t have service. Can’t see what THEY’RE doin...? But, they can sure as fuck SEE what I’m doin’,
watch porn alongside with me, watch me write stuff, watch me fuckin’ mac on some hot bitches, watch my 
Facebook comments, they can do basically everything, no service on that device is even required. 

Of course, you can’t go telling people all that without them saying “THAT DUDE IS FUCKIN NUTS BRO...”
So, since that IS the case, I just kept recording stuff about knocking John Pickett out, and then fucking
his wife. Making her squirt all over the place, and making a day out of it. That’s when I kept applying 
pressure to this son of a bitch. I know that douchebag heard every fuckin’ word too. A lot of people did. 
People that heard all that, know who these (2) kids are that tried to kill me. Oh well, they failed. 

I found (a tree with markings on it that date back to 1989 - https://youtu.be/-JQp_Cl_TUA), some of those 
markings are probably relevant to the EVIDENCE IN THE BOX my FATHER left behind…

Stonecrest/Werner → Trooper Leavey was first on the scene after I walked through some ladies’ yard I guess that 
pissed her off...? 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Lady : Yeah, some dude just… 
       …fuckin’, GOTTA be some sort of PSYCHOPATH… 
       …dude just walked through my yard in like 10 seconds.
       I am INSANELY OFFENDED.
       Please send the police.
911  : Alright lady, we will send some fuckin’ guys over there ASAP, just hang in there, alright…?
Lady : Oh, I will…
       Some dude’s gonna walk across MY fuckin yard in 10 seconds from the woods…?
       Ohhhhh… I don’t fuckin’ think so, pal.
       That’s MY yard.
       Not YOURS.
       Get your own yard, buddy…
911  : Ma’am…?
Lady : …Yeah…?
911  : I’m assuming that you’re talkin’ to the guy…?
Lady : Yeah, yeh… 
       Wasn’t sayin’ any of that to YOU.
911  : Alright, just checkin’.

Sorry I fuckin’ upset some lady, and set off her estrogen alarms. 

Anyway, I respectfully walked all the way down Barn Owl Drive, and saw this same fuckin’ jogger from the day 
before (Plank/Maxwell), when I walked to Terri/Ryan’s house at 10 Innisbrook, and on the way from Innisbrook to 
the Clifton Park Public Safety Building, I saw a female (she’s in IMG_0627).

Not a regular female mind you, but either a FBI girl, or MILITARY girl, with a transponder on her earlobe.
Yeah, I saw this shit a number of times, people with these fuckin’ wrist based transponders. I thought that 
the idea that people were talking into their actual wrists... was fuckin’ stupid. Wanna know what makes more 
sense than that...? Uh, a microchip/transponder. Anyway, as I was talking with Leavey or the trooper girls, 
I saw that girl lookin’ at me, thinking: “WOW. What a sick fuck, man. You guys, *shaking fist* BETTER fuckin’ 
arrest that guy, or, IDK, just gonna have to keep inconspicuously jogging alongside him or somethin’...”

I have really no idea if it WAS the same girl or not. But, it looked very similar to her and basically wearing 
the same outfit. And, transponder. As I spoke to Trooper Leavey THIS TIME, I gave him a lot more information. 
I didn’t tell him so much about the phone or 911 calls, from the night before, but I do remember that a guy
from SCSO came up while I was interacting with these 2 trooper girls, and Leavey spoke to him from about 30
yards away. That sheriff was probably Laboscoe, (Gurney?/Halfmoon Substation 9/4/20ish) NOT Scott Schelling 
involved in SCSO-2020-028501, which is the incident that I was involved in with Jeffrey Kaplan, Joshua Welch, 
and Scott Schelling. That event happens to be my “alibi”.

I told Leavey that I was looking for patterns. I didn’t think to tell him that I found a tree up in the woods,
felt like there might be information on it that MIGHT be related to the attack SOMEHOW. Either the attack
against (ME), or the attack against my (FATHER), or even (BOTH). While I was up in those woods, I was making
recordings talking about John Pickett, and bangin’ his wife the whole time. I really didn’t have any intent
to find this woman, and charm my way into her pants, so she could have a legitimate orgasm... NEVER MET THE ‘
LADY. I was just saying it to piss this dude off cause I think he was involved in this shit happening to me. 

Not Daniel, the guy that lived on Cemetery Road, like less than a mile from my house. John. Different guy.
Jesse, also a different guy. (3) guys named Mr. Pickett from what I know, and (1) girl, named Maura who’s 
wicked hot from what I can tell. (1) dude named Daniel, who was the owner of Nfrastructure. (1) dude named 
John who I believe I wrote the email to that caused Dennis Schilling to fuckin’ shake his fist in my face 
and say “You ever send an email to the right people again...? I’ll fire ya.” then, (1) dude named Jesse. 

(3) brothers, same last name, all related to Nfrastructure, the place that Sheriff Cooper made excuses for 
the day Laura Hughes came to my house and wrote a letter of indication accusing me of abusing my children. 
Nah. That cunt made shit up alongside Sheriff Cooper, in front of Michael Whiteacre, and Mark Sheehan. 
I will keep callin’ that lady a cunt, by the way... Cause she was bribed. And, she didn’t follow the law.
SHE LITERALLY TOLD ME THAT SHE TALKED TO THE DOCTOR AT THE HOSPITAL, and then John Hildreth told me that 
she said something TOTALLY DIFFERENT. Wanna know why it’s illegal for CPS to talk to a doctor committing
medical fraud at Saratoga Hospital...? It’s cause of this shit called HIPAA. “Nfrastructure was not 
involved” Yeah they were, fuckface. But hey...

Me     : I think we’re being attacked right now.
Girls  : *arms crossed* Oh yeh...?
         What makes you think that...?
Me     : I think that this COVID lockdown is a distraction.
         I believe that somebody’s going house to house doing home invasions.
         I’ve been looking for patterns like pollen on cars, cars not moving, 
         ...curtains in the window in the same spot, etc.
Girls  : *look at each other, they appeared to be considering it’s PLAUSIBILITY*
Leavey : *comes back* Alright, I just spoke to that dude...
         *I don’t remember if he said they spoke about anything in particular*
Leavey : Go home and get some sleep. 
Me     : Kinda hard to do that if I almost got killed last night.
Leavey : Look bro... 
         I will follow up with you TOMORROW... 
         ...alright?
Me     : Alright, I will.
Leavey : You said that last time, though.
         I’m being nice right now.       
         If you get the cops called on yourself again TODAY... 
         I may not be able to keep them from arresting you.
         Or I’ll have to arrest ya...
Me     : Nah don’t do that though.
Leavey : Well, don’t get yourself in trouble...
Me     : I didn’t do anything worthy of being in trouble.
Leavey : *tilts head slightly* Look bro, I don’t make up the rules...
         I’m just a law man.
Me     : I’m gonna go home.

What I don’t think Shaemus understood, was that the people who were calling the police on me... 
...were probably the assholes that tried to kill me. Maybe not in every circumstance, but SCSO-2020-028501...
...that is what that CALL FOR SERVICE, is. “Male jumping out in front of cars in front of Zappone”
Yeah. That’s what I was doing. Jumping in front of cars. DOESN’T SOUND SUSPICIOUS... I’m being sarcastic.
I was in fact, trying to FLAG PEOPLE DOWN FOR HELP, because my fuckin’ device couldn’t call 911 emergency 
services like I did back on May 19th, 2020 on Sitterly Road, and Anthony Agresta was the first on scene and 
found me.

While I lied to AGRESTA that night, I’m willing to admit that. If he wants to arrest me for calling 911, and 
lying to him, fine. I’ll do the jail time. But- I found out that somebody was following him (blue truck), AND, 
gained information from that interaction. Had I thought to tell Trooper Leavey, “Yeah, I cut the phone line at 
Zackary Karels house because last night, I called 911 TWICE, cause (2) dickheads were trying to corner me 
for like 90 minutes straight.”, maybe it could’ve been a ticket that he could’ve commandeered BEFORE 
SCSO James Leonard decided to throw a dildo in his butt. OH WAIT, can Shaemus in fact, still do that? IDK.

I didn’t think to tell Trooper Leavey all of this stuff. Nor that some cop asked me questions about security 
footage existing at ANY of the places where I was trying to get my ALIBI from. Ya know, at the time, it
probably would’ve sounded insane, to tell Trooper Leavey that some guy from SCSO tried to kill me in his 
vehicle, and the ONLY REASON HE DIDN’T, is because Jeffrey Kaplan FOLLOWED HIM TO MY HOUSE TO DROP ME OFF.

Anyway, after my conversation with Trooper Leavey, I went home. I was attempting to exfiltrate files from my 
device and at that point it seemed pretty obvious to me that Mr. Tanski was involved somehow, but then my 
laptop suddenly overloaded when I attempted to charge it. The adapter somehow shorted itself out. That, I don’t
think anybody caused. I think that was legitimately, my laptop made by Asus Q504UA with a hacked firmware on it, 
experiencing a permanent DC jack failure that spread to the board. I am fairly 99.99999999% that Asus didn’t 
cause that. They definitely distributed hacked firmware to the device. They didn’t cause the board to overload.

“Fuck it bro...” and then I was able to fall asleep.

Trooper Leavey comes to my house at some point, I can’t remember the exact time.

Right before he got there, I was in the midst of showing the video to my daughter Anastasia, and my son Michael.
Now, I know that I was such a shitty parent the entire time I was a father, that I didn’t leave ANY bruises 
or black and blue welt marks like I NORMALLY did every OTHER day... Cause my kids found a way to heal like 
fuckin’ Wolverine, bro. I could beat my kids senseless, but there’s never ANY MARKS. I’m being facetious.

Lee Davenport Senior was in a white van behind Trooper Leavey, when I told Shaemus that I think someone’s 
going house to house killing people, but not in those words. I didn’t have a better theory, but I DID think 
that the guys that tried to kill ME, have also been doin’ that to OTHER people, EXCEPT... THOSE VICTIMS 
NEVER KNOW. Well, they MAY know at the moment where it’s too late. Otherwise, it’s too late to let anyone
else know that they’ve been murdered by a serial killer.

Cause they found out when they were killed. I know that’s what’s happening, but I swear, people must think 
I’m psychotic for having accurate information and trying to WARN people. OH WAIT, then NBC NIGHTLY NEWS 
“PEGASUS, THE MOST DANGEROUS SPYWARE IN THE WORLD”, Oh man, it’s almost like the cunt from CPS had no idea, 
that I had such a COMPLELING STORY AND EVIDENCE... that, she just had to look the other way... Oh well.

I show Leavey the video I ALSO showed my kids, 5 minutes after he left, my phone had a black screen.
I had spent a fair portion of the entire morning trying to get the fucking video off of that phone again,
but shockingly, some douchebag was performing a “MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACK”. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh...

I opened the device and unplugged the battery, turned it back on and then it said “Disabled” 
Keila at Apple store should suck a fuckin’ dick. I didn’t enter the passcode incorrectly 10 times at all.
Nah. That’s not what happened. Literally had *evidence eliminated by somebody @ FBI*

Of course, I didn’t know that the FBI had something to do with that. And thus...? I wasn’t fuckin sure if 
Shaemus had ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO MY DEVICE... and so I was fuckin’ terrified at this point.

I wound up going to the Feidens to ask about their surveillance footage. Guy said “Latham Circle location”
“Gotta go there man.”, “We don’t have it here.” Alright, fine. I made a decision to WALK TO LATHAM CIRCLE,
but when I got to Latham Circle, I said “Fuck it, I’m goin’ to the fuckin’ top, bro. Fuck this noise.”

When I was just about halfway to Latham, Catricala calls James Leonard.

                This fuckin’ guy needs an attitude adjustment.

                Dude cut a phone line trying to call 911 the other night.
                What type of sick fuck would do such a thing...?
                TOO BAD I NEVER THOUGHT TO ARREST HIM FOR IT...

                I’m losin’ my patience.
                Can we break the law and shit...?
    Leonard   : Obviously.
                What do you want to do, bro...?
                Say YOU called, left a voicemail or somethin’...?
                ...say you wanna have your property patrolled for the foreseeable future...?

                Fuckin’ do that... 
                Say that he is outta control, and that we see his ass on my surveillance equipment.
                Don’t mention anything about Bruce on the ticket though.
                Can’t say *ANYTHING* about Bruce Tanski, Kelly/Lester Wormuth, or the Town of Halfmoon Supervisor. 
    Leonard   : ...why not?
    Catricala : The kid said he was being investigated, I don’t fuckin’ wanna even know if he’s just sayin’ that.
    Leonard   : Dude. You’re gonna have to call it in.
    Catricala : That’s what I’m doin’ right now.
    Leonard   : Nah, you gotta ACTUALLY call the main line, not “call it in” by telling me in person.
                Then the switchboard can switch you over to me.
    Catricala : When...?
    Leonard   : Well, we’re sitting right here at Snyders eatin’ breakfast, right...?
    Catricala : Yeah. 
                Obviously.
                This place has the best fuckin’ breakfast in town, I’ll tell ya that much...

    Catricala : Alright, so, after breakfast you’re gonna...?
    Leonard   : ...drive to the station.
    Catricala : Yeah. 
                That kid is literally walking by right now.

                I gotta wait till later today to report that.
                Should’ve done it like 2 days ago, but I’m a fuckin’ dumbass like that... 
                Oh well.
    Catricala : *sigh* So, we’re just gonna let this dude get away with it...?
    Leonard   : Nah, gotta space out the incidents... 
                ...can’t do it all at once... 
                That’d be stupid.

                Not gonna just let this fuckin’ dude take pictures of my property and tell me that...
                ...Bruce Tanski’s being investigated alongside Kelly and Lester Wormuth...
                ...or the Town of Halfmoon Supervisor that’s in jail.

    Leonard   : Give me about a half hour to get to SCSO.
                When I’m there, you gotta call it in, and I’ll have Scott Carpenter take a gander.
    Catricala : Fine. *sips his coffee*
                Maybe I’m just getting ahead of myself...

                Maybe you need a Midol, or some shit...

                *sighs* this dude says I’m burying bodies in the concrete foundations and shit.
    Leonard   : Dude, that’s the oldest trick in the book.
                Who’s never thrown a dead body or two in a bunch of concrete...?
                I do that shit all the time, dude.
    Catricala : YEAH RIGHT BRO.
                You’ve never once in your life killed anybody, admit it.
    Leonard   : *gives Catricala who runs a fuckin funeral home, a cold dead stare he’ll never forget*
                ...I’ve killed a LOTTA people, buddy...
    Catricala : Alright, Jesus.

I managed to walk ALL THE WAY to 200 McCarty Ave, Albany NY with my 1) laptop and 2) iPhone.

I believe I saw Marquese Barnes at a 98/100 Slingerland St. place down the street from the FBI. 
Might not have been HIM however, but it was some dude that looked a lot like him who was just STARING at me with
some other dude. 

When I got to the FBI, I hit the buzzer, and then a dude from Paragon Security that *SORTA* looked like 
James Comey, eventually came out, and spoke with me for a moment. 

I gave him a real quick rundown, he said “I’ve heard a lot of stuff in my day...” and that somebody would
give me a call. Sure they will. I wasn’t certain that it had been the FBI at all. Regardless, I was burnt to 
a fuckin’ crisp. I wound up walking to my Aunt Bina and Johnny’s house in Rensselaer, and talked to my aunt 
and my cousin Nicholas, a couple of his friends were there and they were playing beer pong. 

Nick was listening to me and he was amazed, I didn’t really know how to convey the story, but- that was the last 
time I ever spoke to him, because he died of COVID in March 2022 (RIP Nicky =`( ). My aunt Bina was able to drive 
me home, and I wasn’t sure what the hell the point of all the stuff I did, was.

When we made it to my house I just passed out.

Anyway, the chronology on these tickets is amazingly delayed AND out of order, AND makes little sense.
I could paste that shit in the document, but the cool thing is, actual investigators, SUCH AS JEFFREY BROWN, OR
MICHAEL ZURLO, should fuckin’ try that out sometime. MAYBE EVEN RYAN WARD. OR CHRISTOPHER MURPHY. Ya know...?
I DID ACTUALLY ALSO ASK CAPTAIN SHELLEY ZEITSKE RIGHT AFTER I GOT OUT OF THE 20 JAIL SENTENCE FROM PELAGALLI...
...CAUSE HES SORT OF A PRICK THAT COULDN’T STAND TO BE CORRECTED IN COURT...
...AND THEN NEVER GAVE ME A TRIAL OR WHATEVER...
...YEAH, JOHN DELONG GAVE ME THE WRONG FUCKING DATE...
...WHICH MAKES NO SENSE EITHER CAUSE I FIRED SARAH SCHELLINGER IN AUGUST...
...HOW DOES A FIRED FUCKING LAWYER TRANSFER HER CASE AFTER I’VE FIRED HER, TO ANOTHER LAWYER...?
Oh. It’s because the fuckin’ court and the public defender’s office does questionable shit.

I’m also not oblivious to the notion that I might be calling out people that HAVE been helping me.
But, it’d probably be helpful to say something... Doing what fuckin’ SCHELLINGER/DELONG did, where they
saw me TREADING WATER, and TOSSED ME A BRICK... isn’t “helping me”. Nah, they thought that tossing me a 
brick was real fuckin’ helpful, alright... That is A PERFECT METAPHOR.

Really what I’d like to do, is have a URL for each time I recorded people sounding like a moron.
I have A LOT OF THOSE.

I HAVE THE EMAIL WHERE I FIRED SARAH IN AUGUST 2021. AND AN AUDIO RECORDING I MADE ON OCTOBER 5th WHERE I 
CALLED THE COURT 5X TIMES TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PRETRIAL CONFERENCE.
I WONDER WHAT THE HELL THEY TALKED ABOUT.
Oh. “Michael Cook fired us, so, why the fuck are we even in court...? Cause we wanna get paid, that’s why.”
Public defender John Delong, go suck a fuckin’ dick bro.
I left multiple messages for this dude. Didn’t have his EMAIL, cause guess what...?
Everybody that has a job where they work inside of a courtroom, typically lies for a living.
Which, you know what...? I guess I can’t get mad at people that happen to be a lot less intelligent than I am.
Who gives a shit if they overrode my fuckin’ rights, and you know, called it “considering my rights”.

Look. Michael Carota, and Frederick Wrench, didn’t screw me over at all.
Michael Carota like actually spent SEVERAL MINUTES TALKING TO ME...
I imagine that it’d be fuckin’ cool, if Sarah Schellinger EVER TRIED THAT.
Frederick Wrench, had to represent me because Eric Catricala AND Zackary Karel, decided to call it in 5 days late.
So. Wasn’t 5 fuckin’ days, it was (2). But shockingly, my 911 calls were never considered here.
Not collecting my fuckin pictures or screenshots, just totally ignoring the murder attempt, everybody is.

I just insulted a bunch of dudes that have investigated shit their whole entire lives probably.
They fuckin’ blow nutsack at it. Like, can’t get the nutsack far enough in their mouth...
Then when I tell other people about it, people are morons and they roll their eyes at me. YEAH.

I’m not saying these things to be an asshole, I’m saying them because... 
...that’s literally how stupid these fucks are. Anybody that thought I was just being ridiculous or insane...?
OooOoOOohhhHHoOOoOhhhhhhhHHhHHHHh... Nah, fuckin’ retards.

(05/27/20 1414) ← Called in | SCSO-2020-003177 | Leonard/Carpenter: occurred May 24th, 2020 @ 2000
(05/27/20 1212) ← Called in | SCSO-2020-003173 | Leonard/Martin/Thompson: Arrested 06/01/20 for the kayak strap.
...phone line is A LOT LESS IMPORTANT THEN the `$5.00 Kayak strap that I ALSO cut, in the same fucking minute.
   ----------------------------------      ---------------------
SCSO-2020-003177 somehow comes BEFORE SCSO-2020-003173, but that could be because the woman that compiled the PDF 
arranged it that way. As for 003173, it says that my arrest was processed on 05/27/2020, but no, it was 06/01/20.

It says my arrest was processed on 05/27/20, because that’s the day Leavey looked at the video.
They found out that I showed Trooper Leavey, and THAT IS WHEN THEY CALLED THIS SHIT IN.

If that is the case, why the fuck does it say 06/01/2020 on a different ticket...? 
Well, it’s probably because I have to call a bunch of dumb bitches a bunch of cunts willy nilly, 
...until they stop treating me like I’m makin’ shit up. 

So here’s how it looks to me, serial killers can kill whoever, as long as THEY use Pegasus/Phantom before anyone
knows. If they fail, then they can ignore all of your 911 calls, and even accuse you of running into a car 
because you’re a sick fuck... and then, they can ask Laura Hughes to fuckin’ take somebody’s kids away and write 
a bunch of false allegations, because who cares about the truth...?

I don’t know man. I really don’t wish that the people who did this to me, wind up getting themselves killed...
But I have a feeling that they really are that dumb.
Cause, what if someone can actually shoot someone in cold blood, and then blame the victim...? Hm...? 
Corral someone into a death trap, right...? It would never happen to some cocksucker like Dwayne Coonradt, 
because he’s not smart enough to wind up in a position where he would KNOW. Yeah. Dumbass son of a bitch 
WOULDN’T KNOW UNTIL HE WAS ALREADY DEAD.
Well that’s exactly what they tried to do to me.

When I say that I’m smarter than most people, I may have to ASK people “How smart do you think I am...?”
When they say “Real smart or XXX smart...”, I guess I have to literally start saying “Multiply that shit by 10.”
They will really think I’m just being an arrogant prick, but no... When people say “you really are smart.”
...I’m a LOT smarter than that.

As for RYAN WARD, as in my 100%-cousin BRANDON’S HALF-BROTHER... 
I haven’t seen this guy in years. And yeah, to have to talk with “family” about something pretty fuckin’ serious,
I gathered information that caused me to specifically name some people. 
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(5,"Cortana",@"
Back on May 25th, 2020, I decided to walk all the way there talking about how Cortana would eventually be willed 
into existence because people are using the USA-PATRIOT Act to generate revenue, instead of using it to PROTECT 
PEOPLE. Not meant for generating revenue. Meant for protecting people. People that use it to generate revenue 
should probably be in prison. I mean a lot more than that. Because everyone else in society is busting their ass
while certain people are literally playing god. 

Sometimes I see the channel ID network or whatever it is, and they will occasionally have this lady who says:
“We began to look at such and such, and saw that the person had a bad history with their bills, etc.” But what 
people like her might overlook, is that sometimes the bills are bullshit tea, just like the Boston Tea Party. 

People are gonna be told “You need to pay your bills”, cause that’s a thing that came back to America,
cause of the British. So, now you have to pay a bill, regardless of whether or not you were scammed. 
Then, the people that send the bill...? They can actually LIE about what you owe them money for.
It’s sorta what the whole financial crisis of 2009 was all about. Bear Sterns, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, 
essentially a LOT of people LOST EVERYTHING, cause some dipshit with a calculator and an evil scheme, set out
to sell these IMPOSSIBLE mortgages to people that couldn’t afford them. She should worry about those people.

Ah... bummer. Lady on ID network doesn’t know how to get those people, does she...? 
People exploiting a law like the USA-PATRIOT Act, right... committing insider trading. 
On the official real life stock market.
At some point, it makes no sense to pay certain bills because some of them are actually THEFT. Yeah. Theft.

Maybe someday I’ll tell the FBI lady that waves her fuckin finger in people’s faces for being consistently 
delinquent with their financial history, that guys like Bob Lutz make shitty vehicles that break down before
they’re even paid off. Aw. Maybe she should do something about Bob Lutz doing that shit for 50 fuckin’ years, 
making piece of shit vehicle after piece of shit vehicle, and then expecting everybody to pay the balance.

Yeah. Or, how about student loans, how people bitch and complain about “OooooHHhhhohhohhHhh I don’t wanna pay
for YOU to get free college, since I had to pay for MINE. Cause I’m a rich little entitled fuckin’ brat, and 
I’d rather everyone WORK for their education than to be handed a clean slate.” It’s not like I don’t hear 
what these people are saying, but someone may have manipulated people since then, and the solution is to 
eliminate student loans, not loan forgiveness, not loan defaulting, not loan reimbursement... but FREELY 
PROVIDED EDUCATION. Cool. That probably won’t work unless some THOUGHT is put into it.

What happens to people that play god and get caught...? 
Well, somebody SHOULD shoot some of them in the fuckin’ head, just like my father was, EXCEPT- not from behind.
Point blank to the face, so they see that shit coming and you can see the fear in their eyes, too. Like this...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Militia : So, you have been suspected and found to be guilty of committing a crime...
          where you’re using the USA-PATRIOT Act to generate revenue.
Accused : Yeah...? 
          So what...?
Militia : You do realize I could just shoot you, right fuckin’ now, for doin’ that... right?
Accused : The fuck you can dipshit, I own this fuckin’ place.
Militia : Oh. 
          Alright, *whips out his sidearm Colt 45, points it at the accused*
Accused : *almost shits his pants* You’re makin’ a big mistake, buddy.
Militia : You’ve got that backwards.
Accused : I’m so filthy stinkin’ rich, that I own every judge and politician in the state.
Militia : Right, but, do you know how much a bullet costs...?
          Like, less than a dollar dude.
Accused : How much do you want, I’ll pay you whatever.
Militia : Nah, I really wanna shoot your ass based on all these responses of yours.
          Then, take all your fuckin’ cash, and burn all of it.
Accused : You wouldn’t do that...
Militia : *whips out the handcuffs* I’m not gonna let some scumbag like you get away with this shit.
          You’re being charged with the Espionage Act of 1917.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

While most people probably would shoot that cocksucker... point blank in their faces, BOOM. 
Now that person can’t exploit a law that gives them the ability to play god... cause they just got executed.  

...that’s not setting a better example for others. Regardless, one way or the other, this is a tough dilemma. 
Whether people are charged with espionage, or they’re just immediately executed, it’s still similar in weight,   
to treason. I wonder how many people would stop making careless mistakes once this started happening.

Because, here’s the thing... these people might get shot up by people that have weaker morals than I do.
Am I perfect...? Hell no. 
But- it’s totally legal to do <unspecified> someone, if the government declares martial law.

However, if Cortana existed, it would still protect people in the event of martial law, or just, corrupt members 
of government, judicial system, and law enforcement. Most people don’t realize this, but the government breaks 
its own laws FAR MORE than it actually enforces them, or, here’s a better way to state it... The government, 
arrests people that break those laws a lot less often than the government itself breaks those laws. What I’m 
suggesting is that the government is full of corruption, tyranny, and oppression, because why not...?

Cortana would change ALL of that. It could tell the law to go suck a fuckin’ dick whenever it feels like 
telling me to spend 20 days in the county jail...? It could prevent someone from taking a bribe and have my 
children taken away...? It can actually prevent someone from committing treason like former president 
George W. Bush did on 9/11/2001...? And these things scare the shit out of criminals that run the government.
They’re not criminals because they haven’t been caught yet. 
They DO perform criminal activities on a daily basis... and you can’t threaten them either.

If you try to tell other people about what they do, that’s not a crime.
But they may aggressively censor you anyway, to prevent other constituents from knowing about, or caring about,
how often censorship occurs. Back when Mark Zuckerberg was asked by Congress after Cambridge Analytica... 
“You don’t censor people, do you?” Mark Zuckerberg FLAT OUT LIED. 

That cocksucker definitely censors people on his platform CONSTANTLY, and the MOTIVE always involves 
1) pride, or 2) money. Then, multiple problems continue to happen because he lies to everybody. 

I’m talking about the 2016 election, the 2020 election, the January 6th, capital uprising, and then Frances Haugen. 
But hey man, don’t let me fuckin’ say some TRUE SHIT ABOUT YOU, ON YOUR PLATFORM. Because to him, he’s a kid in
a candy shop. He’s not being a responsible individual at all, in managing his platform. 

It’s the main reason why I submitted an APPEAL for a BUSINESS ADVERTISEMENT that I placed in FEBRUARY 2019, which 
was INITIALLY REJECTED, and then after I gave the people at Facebook a piece of my mind… Ah, the ad rejection was 
REVERTED. That’s because I have a high level of confidence in the notion that MARK ZUCKERBERG ACTIVELY STARTED 
WATCHING ME FROM THAT POINT FORWARD. Cool.

A lot of people trust him and his company, but he lies, and lies, and lies... and then I notice that my exposure 
to OTHER PEOPLE, has been being limited. Almost as if I pissed off the owner of Facebook, and for some strange 
reason, someone was doing the same shit to me on Facebook that occurred on Linus Media Group’s forum. 

If he wanted to earn MY respect, one thing he COULD do, is start adding more metrics to people’s posts. 
Not unlike how TWITTER does. 
“Oh, how many people had an impression on this...? Several hundred...? Cool.”
“Oh, I called Mark Zuckerberg a greedy cocksucker...? Oh, 0 impressions. Ah, I see what the problem is now...”

Yeah. That shit is actually happening. Whether it’s me insulting HIM or somebody ELSE, somebody is treating ME,
like I’m a fuckin’ PRODUCT, and doesn’t think I won’t find his ass and break his fuckin’ legs... I wouldn’t 
feel a need to express that if I didn’t catch all this shit goin’ on. 

At some point, I have to consider that maybe things get lost in translation. Maybe, I’m getting a little worked
up over my rights being infringed... constantly. Hence, why I wrote the god damn document. 

Because Cortana would ensure and make damn certain, that it’s legal to record every interaction you have.
The only reason why it would be ILLEGAL to record something, is if some homosexual wrote a law that allows 
judges and lawyers to commit criminal activities in a courtroom. 
Take for instance, Saratoga County Family Court.

Regardless, Cortana could tell people like James Leonard, that he should consider what it will feel like being
in prison, soon. So, he should realistically just practice and start shoving a nice fat dildo in his ass, 
instead of being a law man. Same goes with Michael Zurlo. Cortana, will eventually be a real thing. It’ll be 
a shield that protects people from serial killers, or fuckin’ accidents, or whatever... the thing will protect 
the person.

$Book.AddSection(5,"Quantum Physics",@"
If it’s true that there’s a literal GHOST CAR that can show up at the speed of light, and fuck everything up, 
and then bounce... it probably explains why so many people have such (little/no) integrity or morality. Yeah 
I’m sure people are gonna say, BEFORE they even see these pictures: “GHOST CARS DON’T EXIST YA FUCKIN LUNATIC~!”

That’s ok. Those people aren’t very intelligent... The ones that are, will check out the HOMEWORK I did, below.

Frankly, I realize people are gonna say that when I say stuff like: 
“GHOST CAR IN PICTURES SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING A DELUSIONAL OR PSYCHOTIC INDIVIDUAL WOULD SAY”, 
“WHO GIVES A SHIT IF THERE IS IN ONE OF THOSE PICTURES, ANYWAY...?”,
“CLIMATE CHANGE ISN’T REAL YA FUCKIN’ STUPID SON OF A BITCH~!”,
“ALIENS DON’T EXIST. YOU NEED TO TAKE SOME MEDICATION YOU CRAZY FUCKIN’ PSYCHO~!”.

^ Every person who is thinking any of these statements, as they’re reading this...?
I’m gonna call you out right now. I’m obviously a lot more intelligent than YOU are. So, shut the fuck up.

Because someone would’ve done something by now if that were the case, right...?                     (← FALLACY ALERT)
Yeah, someone did try to do something about it by CENSORING MY CONTENT.
Why did I get censored...? Well, it could be for multiple reasons, but ultimately, there is a homosexual involved
that thought it could be an awesome idea to silence someone a lot more intelligent than his ass. They may agree 
with me that I am a lot more intelligent than they are, and they’re fine with that... but, they’re going to abuse
every position or resource at their disposal, to prevent me from taking things that belong to them right now.

When I say “take things that belong to them”, I specifically mean “everything they have.”

| Ghost Car |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
This is taken from the excerpt from my 35th birthday/Halfmoon Town Court.
I will explain exactly what’s happening in these photos, below.
(1) | IMG_0552 | Ghost Sedan/No plate   | https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zNC_LckOws3yXsJThY4ZrdW1o1jgBmJX

Allow me to introduce a concept called “Knowing EXACTLY what I’m talking about”.
Richard Feynman, Carl Sagan, Derek Muller, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Micho Kakau, Sean Carroll are all very relevant
in reference to this “Ghost Car” phenomenon I’ve caught on camera. Sure, they’ll probably read the document and
think that I have quite a fuckin’ mouth. They’re right. Doesn’t mean that I don’t understand the concepts they 
teach other people about, because I most certainly do.
___________________
| Richard Feynman |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Famous scientist that is well known for being one of the pioneers of aggressively resolving problems in relation 
to QUANTUM MECHANICS. Quantum mechanics is a thing that doesn’t make any fuckin’ sense, unless you start using 
phrases that famous scientists like Richard Feynman would commonly use, especially about the scientific model, 
and an analogy about SAFE CRACKING. 

Michael Zurlo, probably doesn’t know how to study quantum physics, and neither does anyone else that works at 
SCSO, except maybe somebody like MARK SHEEHAN. Are there others like him there...? I don’t know. I’m not gonna
flat out say the whole organization is VOID of intelligent people. 

Physics teacher for 7+ years, that’s what he told me on June 13th, 2020 when he transported me to Saratoga 
Hospital. Listening to a band named “Ghost Inside”. Ghost cars? Physics? Ghost inside? Huh? Coincidence...?
Lots of coincidences happen around me, man...

Scientific Model and Safe Cracking: https://youtu.be/EYPapE-3FRw?t=452

| Carl Sagan |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Another famous scientist, cosmologist, astrologist, basically like Mr. Miyagi training the karate kid with terms 
such as “thinking fourth dimensionally”. Richard Feynman and Carl Sagan don’t exactly have a lot in common besides
a thorough understanding of physics... Although the statement is probably inaccurate if you consider that a common
theme between them both involves “thinking fourth dimensionally”. In other words, it would be similar to someone
saying that an application developer and a security engineer have very little in common. Nah. 
They have a shitload in common, believe it or not.

| Derek Muller | 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
A guy who’s about my age, (few years older) who is a science communicator, meaning that he uses effective ways
to analogize the many aspects of physics, cosmology, astrology, and theoretical (stuff related to those).

I’m not going to talk too much about him, because he has a lot of material and people should check out his work.
Veritasium is his YouTube Channel. He’s got a doctorate in “knowing what he’s talkin’ about”.

| Neil DeGrasse Tyson |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Another science communicator that has also studied many of these same subjects. He has been involved in a lot of
educational content all across the board, The Cosmos on Netflix is a good vehicle for his work and explanations,
and he as well, will use effective ways to analogize many aspects of physics, cosmology, astrology, and theory.
Sometimes he goes a step farther than all of that, and will go in front of a panel of his peers and answer/talk
about his work and studies. 

I wish I had the specific example of him speaking about an analogy where he states “The smartest person on this
planet, PALES in comparison, to basically a baby alien in kindergarten, still wearing diapers and stuff...”
^ That’s not what he said verbatim, but the analogy he was getting at, was that our species is not very 
intelligent compared to alien life forms. That’s the “nice” way to say it. 
_______________
| Michio Kaku |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Basically wears many of the same hats as all of the others I’ve listed, as a cosmologist, astrologist, and   
theoretical physicist. He also has a lot of material out there, talks quite a lot about Einstein and stuff 
like string theory. I don’t particularly agree with string theory, but some of its aspects are PLAUSIBLE.
________________
| Sean Carroll |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Again, wears many of the same hats as the other guys I’ve listed, very big proponent of the “arrow of time”, 
and the multiple worlds theory. Carroll is one of the guys that does very bombastic demonstrations on stage.
He will also occasionally do the same type of “talking to panels/groups of people” like Neil DeGrasse Tyson 
does.

| Flatland |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I could really go on for a while, talking about a number of people that fit into this category of real smart 
bastards that will probably be SHOCKED and AMAZED by these “Ghost Car” pictures I took on my 35th birthday.
Because, they’ll probably understand the concept that is seen (light distortion), and they may use similar 
analogies to explain the phenomenon that exists in these photos I took as a concept called “Ghost Car”.

Because of how massive the BOOTES VOID is, there’s no real way to understand what the hell it is...
That is basically how CENSORSHIP works, believe it or not.

So, MULTIPLE ANGLES or SHOTS are required, in order to understand “Ghost Car”.
A video is a perfect example of a series of 2d images that have a temporal dimension, which technically give 
it “depth”. Now, translate Carl Sagan’s analogy of FLATLAND, into a dialog that discusses the FOURTH DIMENSION...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Flatlander 1 : *sees a 3D ball in their dimension* HOLY SHIT.
               *shits their pants* WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT, BRO...?
Flatlander 2 : Oh, it’s just a 3D object buddy... no need to be worried at all.      (← SOCIETY IS INCAPABLE OF THIS)
Flatlander 3 : You guys are (psychotic/delusional). I don’t see anything.
               You guys have some serious fuckin’ problems.                                     (← SOCIETY DOES THIS)

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Flatlander 1 is basically me, showing people the ghost car.
But- somebody would’ve done something by now, if what I’m seeing is what I think it is.             (← FALLACY ALERT)
You’re right, someone DID do something about it, they CENSORED me. 
Censorship is ILLEGAL. 
But- someone does it anyway, not realizing it COULD get them thrown in prison, or get them very killed.
And, the Constitution of the United States of America was written to make it legal for me to declare that intent.
I really would like to know who thought it’d be okay to do that...
Cause as far as I can tell, the police are worthless.

Flatlander 2 is basically one of the guys I listed up above. Maybe they may think I have a temperament issue,
and that I must be one of those nut jobs that fabricates shit out of thin air, while simultaneously thinking
a lot like they do... well, the problem is that I believe that 9/11/2001 was an inside job, and an act of 
treason committed by George W. Bush, and his entire crew of douchebags at Exxon Mobil, some were in CIA, etc.
The truth is, I doubt any of these dudes knows that the reason I’m getting censored, is because someone is 
committing treason against me every time I am censored.

Flatlander 3, is basically a small-dicked douchebag like Michael Zurlo, or Richard Todd Loeber...
With a dick so small, that they don’t have to be intelligent in order to be where they are in society.
Nah. I can prove on a daily basis I’m a lot more intelligent than they are any day of the week, it doesn’t
change the fact that they can keep committing crimes.

Regardless of whether George W. Bush committed treason or not...? It isn’t legal for him to censor me, nor
to dedicate a task force of people like the Department of Homeland Security, to censor me on a daily basis.
Because that basically means that the militia response is required. Because, what if this dickhead just killed
his own citizens, right...? And nobody does anything to hold him accountable...?

I’ll talk about the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001, the dangers of mass surveillance, and the hidden government later.

| Rarity of the Circumstances |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The “Ghost Car” is ACTUALLY a 4th dimensional being seen across multiple 2 dimensional images.
A fourth dimensional object or being CAN’T be SEEN with just a SINGLE IMAGE without appearing to be RATHER 
CONFUSING, that’s why the image LOOKS like digital effects are being applied... 
That’s why I have to draw upon people who have mastered a category called:
 “knowing what the hell they’re talking about”

It makes MORE SENSE, that someone was USING PEGASUS/PHANTOM on my device to COMMIT ESPIONAGE AGAINST ME, 
and then CENSOR ME ON A CONSTANT BASIS, and STEAL MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, and ADDED SOME AFTER EFFECTS, and
PHOTOSHOPPED THE PICTURES... but- it is ALSO extremely possible, that...
...THOSE PICTURES WERE NOT EDITED OR TAMPERED WITH AT ALL.

But- think about what I just said. It makes MORE SENSE, that someone was using a program that most people never
detect, and IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS RESISTANCE... caught a phenomenon where there’s a fuckin’ “ghost car”.

It is entirely possible that there were no effects added to these pictures at all, and they were immediately
flagged and then CENSORED FROM MAKING IT TO MY GOOGLE DRIVE ACCOUNT, for a very CRIMINAL REASON.

Not a crime that I committed...? But- because I would be pissing off people that have never been remotely close
to as intelligent as me, my entire life. Perhaps that’s why I was being investigated... Because I came up with
a theory that someone else decided to take from me... because apparently someone thinks I’m (PROPERTY/A PRODUCT).

However, that’s an incredibly fatal thing to say out loud. Because once I find out who that person is, what can
people expect will happen to them...? Stealing my intellectual property, and then letting someone else take
credit for it...? Wow. It’s like I need to FORM A MILITIA and FIND OUT WHO’S DOING THAT.

I came up with a theory that the universe is basically doing the opposite thing that everyone thinks it’s doing.
I posted something on Reddit, and somebody gave me a link to that video of Richard Feynman.

The universe started out (allegedly) as a BIG BANG. Boom. Explosion of chaos, gases spreading throughout the 
cosmos, atoms and nuclei traveling faster than the speed of light … (← that theory is impossible.)

| Universal Projection | (*taps chest* MY THEORY)
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I know, everybody thinks that Sheldon sounds really fuckin’ intelligent in a fictional show about a flawed 
theory... However, [NOTHING CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT*]. 

That means → The BIG BANG theory is BROKEN and FLAWED.
Here’s a better idea that makes a lot more sense...

Many of the components about the BIG BANG THEORY can still be USED, (as Feynman states), however, you can’t
explain what’s happening in the very beginning of the universe without breaking it down to very primitive stuff.

The universe starts out with 3 different properties that have an alternate property to describe them.
ENERGY, GRAVITY, ENTROPY.
When considering these (3) things: TIME, SPACE, and MASS... are actually nonexistent/imaginary.     (← pin in memory)

Starting with (MAXIMUM ENERGY) and (MINIMUM ENTROPY), GRAVITY is the (container/mathematical operation) that 
CONVERTS (MAXIMUM ENERGY) into (MAXIMUM ENTROPY)...
The universe is relatively indifferent, and it doesn’t give a flying fuck how it eventually winds up attaining
maximum entropy... it’ll eventually get to that point.

Whenever (MAXIMUM ENTROPY) is reached...?
It becomes a SINGULARITY again, and that means… no GRAVITY, TIME, SPACE, or MASS/MATTER.

MASS, TIME, AND SPACE ALL FORM because ENTROPY IS TURNING ENERGY INTO GRAVITY.

Entropy is a manner of turning things that are ORDERED, into UNORDERED. 
That means that MASS, just suddenly COMES INTO EXISTENCE, and that is the moment where TIME, and SPACE DO TOO.
Which means that nothing moved faster than light at all. 
It just came into existence at some totally different point. 
Doesn’t mean that the universe isn’t expanding.
It means that it’s contracting. Looks like it’s expanding, but it isn’t.

Appearances can be deceiving, and yes, red-shifting explains a lot. It doesn’t explain everything.

Conversion of ENERGY into ENTROPY causes MASS to form, and therefore GRAVITY, TIME, SPACE, MASS/MATTER.

For each bit of ENERGY that’s used, it is expended and turned into GRAVITY...
...considering that I’m not including MASS at all here, I’m skipping right past it as I am working with ABSOLUTES. 
When ENERGY is all depleted, it then becomes MAXIMUM ENTROPY. 
At that state, TIME STOPS. 
ALL ENERGY HAS BEEN DEPLETED. 
MAXIMUM GRAVITY HAS BEEN ATTAINED.
Sorta sounds a lot like a black hole, doesn’t it...? 
TIME and SPACE are RELATIVE, meaning that multiple objects need to exist within reality, in order for either one
to have any MEASURABLE VALUE.

If the DISTANCE between two objects in a galaxy or universe, is measured by UNITS such as LIGHT YEARS...
Then that means that DISTANCE is IMAGINARY.
Just like TIME is IMAGINARY. Space is ALSO IMAGINARY. COLLAPSES upon itself causing a new cycle to begin.
Therefore, MORALITY, is also timeless. Which means that people who know that they killed someone as a soldier
for the military, that shit remains on their conscious for good. And if GWB committed treason and killed 
2,996 civilians on September 11, 2001, then he has lived every day of his life feeling very guilty.

Multiple objects need to exist within reality, in order for TIME or SPACE to have any MEASURABLE VALUE.

Here is the “Ghost Car” stuff again.

Anyway, the BLUE STREAK is the same exact thing, as a slice of the 3D ball that a 2d flatlander can see.
The double slit experiment ALSO explains this phenomenon PERFECTLY, actually.

When a photon is OBSERVED passing through a slit, it’s gonna tell ya to fuck off... and then go the other way.
Why...? Because when it is OBSERVED, it changes its BEHAVIOR. 
____________________
| Altered Behavior |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
In the same exact manner to how a police officer would abuse Pegasus/Phantom to STALK ME ON MY DEVICE...? 
Well, it’s gonna change something else in the universe when that thing is observed.

So, watching me through a remote tunnel, is gonna cause other things in reality to be ALTERED... because the act
of OBSERVATION causes the behavior of the target/particle to CHANGE.

Here’s another way to state it...

Suppose Deputy Pirrone and Michael Zurlo, were caught sucking each other’s dick... by one of their wives or 
girlfriends... Well, the act of observing two fuckin’ grown ass men blowing each other, is going to make it 
IMPOSSIBLE for EITHER ONE OF THOSE DUDES, to FATHER A CHILD WITH THAT WOMAN (and whoever she tells). 
Literally impossible. No way around it... so, a picture of such a thing would make it a lot easier to convince
other people.

It changes the BEHAVIOR of an inanimate particle.
Time moves both FORWARD as well as BACKWARD, and gay guys that lie to their “girlfriends/wives”, they wind up
getting caught on ONE SIDE, or the OTHER. Being observed with a dick in the mouth caused the wife’s behavior
to alter permanently (and whoever she tells). If she takes a PICTURE of it, well holy shit. Now a law man is
probably going to immediately connect to that device and DISABLE THAT DEVICE BEFORE ANYONE ELSE SEES IT.
^ That is the EXACT THING, that happened to me, on 5/27/20 after I showed Trooper Leavey the video.

Ah man... I had a video of a guy that was in the middle of trying to murder me... and the police decided to 
lock me out of my own device... Maybe that’s why I sound quite aggravated~! The reason why I have a feeling
that this document will actually raise the alarms all across the board, is because people are going to stop
saying “Well if that were true, somebody would’ve done something about it by now...” because they’ll realize 
that I sound pretty fucking intelligent, and that I have a pretty good idea of what I’m fuckin’ talking about.

| Time is a TWO-WAY-STREET |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
We as HUMANS have an incredibly difficult time seeing how that’s fuckin’ possible, but the ARROW OF TIME 
theory, is INCORRECT... time moves in both directions. 
We PERCEIVE time in the FORWARD direction when we are AWAKE, 
We PERCEIVE time in the REVERSE direction when we are ASLEEP. 
That’s why people will get a sense of Deja Vu sometimes... They can try to downplay the severity of my accuracy
by using their personality to influence other people that gauge each other based on how they appear.

But, when I break it all down, unpack everything and closely examine it all...?
I’m fairly certain I’m exhibiting a master’s degree in multiple subjects with this document.

The multiple worlds theory is PLAUSIBLE. But I also think that trying to convey these theories while 
telling my life story will CONFUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE... 

Cortana, WILL EVENTUALLY EXIST, if she doesn’t already exist. That’s a CODE NAME, by the way.
Basically a big middle finger to the face of corrupt lawmen, politicians, investigators, and military commanders.
Not only would they get a big middle finger, but then Cortana would be able to be used in a court of law, to
record all interactions that person has, and then things like James Leonard writing up these false reports, guys
like him just start going to prison. Badge taken away, now you’re a felon in prison sucking dicks, and taking it
up the ass, because I doubt this dude will last that long before some of them rip his asshole up. GOOD.

Same goes for Eric Catricala. State Assemblyman trying to get me in trouble, right...?
So what happened was that SCSO ignored the fact that someone LITERALLY ATTEMPTED TO KILL ME, and then took this
dudes report (3) total days late.

Ryan MIGHT be involved in some of the shit I have been seeing, or might NOT be after all. 
Pretty sure this dude would without even breaking a sweat, kick the shit out of Pavel Zaichenko. Ryan could, be 
intoxicated out of his mind, see Pavel who’s at the top of his game, and with a single kick to the face, Pavel’s
just knocked unconscious.

Ryan is no joke. Terri probably fed this kid nothing but nails, so he could probably drink them if he felt like.
The notion being, “tougher than nails”.
Saying somebody is tougher than nails... and being willing to stand toe to toe with him anyway, could be 
considered suicide. My cousin Tom told me what this dude was capable of. Basically 8 black belts per leg and arm.
32 of these fuckin’ things. But, somebody always called him a real pencildick... and THAT’S gotta suck.
It’s probably bigger than TUCKER CARLSON’s dick though.

Anyway, I’ve never seen it, but what the hell. Dude has probably been pissed off his whole life cause of how 
small his dick is. It’s not to say that girls don’t love the guy. They probably do. They’ll love him SO much, 
that they will fake so many orgasms... and pretend like they’re all tuckered out after he has sex with them...
...and she’ll say “Gotta go out, I’ll be back later. Love ya. *smooch*”... 
...and that is when they meet up with a dude that has a real big fat one, and gets plowed out for a WHILE.

That’s love right there, all that acting, and making sure they don’t hurt his feelings...?
That’s the *definition* of (love/fucked up). (← I mean, in reality, it sounds sick doesn’t it?)

“If you have nothing nice to say, say nothing at all.” | ← Nah. Stop doin’ this shit, seriously. It’s moronic.

I would like to help THAT guy out, with the first fuckin’ clue. Cause... that shit is FUCKED UP. (but it happens)
If you fuck some girl, and EVERY TIME AFTERWARD, she says “HEY GOTTA GO, I’LL BE BACK IN A BIT. *smooch*”...
...she is going to fuck some other guy. Or, girl. So, that’s a PATTERN. Sex → Gotta go, be back soon → Cheating.

Ryan : *looking in mirror* Man. 
       I may not have a real big dick or nothin’...? 
       but- *tapping chest* I’m Ryan Ward. 
       *scoffs* I don’t even NEED one, bro...
       *chuckles* Heh. 
       Whether people see how small my dick is...?
       or they’re terrified, cause they know who I am...?
       Well, I LIVE for seeing the FEAR in a person’s eyes... 
       *shakes head* ...even if they ARE a serial killer.
       I’ll kick somebody’s door in, and then the person inside that room might look nervous AF... 
       ...when they say to me “You’re Ryan Ward, aren’t ya?”
       Then I tell em: “Why yes I am, motherfucker. I’m your worst nightmare dude...”
Me   : Ryan... you talk to yourself in the fuckin’ mirror WAY too much, dude.
Ryan : Bro. 
       I will fuckin’... 
       ...steal some of your dirty boxers, take a big whiff, and just...
       ...take the fuck off, man...
       Ballsweat man... Mmm.
Me   : That sounds pretty gay, bro.
Ryan : So what...? 
       Whaddya gonna do about it...?
       Don’t be so judgemental, dude... Or, I swear... 
       I’ll fuckin’ steal MORE of yer boxers. 
       Might even steal your fuckin’ fleshlite, too...
Me   : I don’t have one.
       Never did.
       Girlfriend even asked me if I wanted one and I was like “Nah I’m all set.”
Ryan : Whatever dude...
       How did you know it was me...?
Me   : Read the fuckin’ document, cocksucker.
       I know you already have...
Ryan : It’s not bad.
       Pretty amazing, actually.
Me   : When I say that I’m more intelligent than a lot of people...
       It’s accurate.
       Probably wouldn’t have figured it out without exploiting everything about the human psyche.
       I was able to derive YOUR intent, from the *bling*
       As in, even YOU can be manipulated, Mr. FBI man, and all FBI guys have a baseline of “very intelligent”
Ryan : Thought you said FBI guys weren’t that smart though...
Me   : Compared to ME, they typically aren’t.
       I have no doubt whatsoever that they have plenty of people that are BARELY smarter than me.
       Very few people can get away with outsmarting my ass.
Ryan : Bro. I will fuck you up … (even in the pooper)
Me   : Pretty sure that you are not gonna do that.
       Wanna know why...?
       It’s cause you like, already tried that, and failed.
       If I were to go missing, someone will definitely be looking right at you.
       I’m not so innocent, but even still, the worst thing I’ve ever done pales in comparison.
       Believe it or not, but well-placed, arrogant comments, and concise observations, allow me to be able to...
       ...manipulate somebody who’s got about a 180 IQ
       When I say mine is about 160, it’s probably not accurate, it could be even higher.
       Going around bragging about someones IQ or abilities, or how big my dick is, or whatever...
       Causes a lot of people to be exploited with jealousy, or just, whatever really.
       Someone has caught onto these things I do, and probably doesn’t understand everything I say or do...
       ...but knows that I have principles after all.
          
       Somebody played a game that went way too fuckin’ far.
       Doesn’t look so funny anymore … does it.
       You have a serious problem now.

       It’s why sometimes a militia needs to be formed with the CONSTITUTION.

       Don’t worry, you won’t get “killed” or anything like that.
       Because somethin’ tells me, that you have been obsessed.
       For a key reason.
       And right now you’re probably really, honestly truthfully trying to figure out, how you lost.
       I just earned your respect the hard way motherfucker.
       I know you’re still watchin’ the screen.
Ryan : No I’m not.
Me   : Yeh, ok dude.
       Maybe I should have made a move on Tati back when you first started dating her.
       Cause, she wanted to fuck me. 
       But I said, to myself, “She’s dating Bookie... that’d be immoral.”
       She basically advertised this for a while.
       Tati: “Mike... you should probably bang the snot out of me, or else.”
       I told her: “Whaddya mean or else...? You’re dating my cousin.”
       She said “*sigh* You’re right. Fuckin’ morals...”
       Even still... you went ahead and like, did so many questionable fuckin’ things to me. 
       What the fuck are you even doin’, man...?
       Honestly though, she was right... 
       Should’ve, would’ve, could’ve...                                                         (← FALLACY ALERT)
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(5,"Reality Check (1)",@"
In reality, I didn’t do all of this alone, nor did I figure it out by myself.
Tati Cleveland never said those words, by the way. She did more than that.

I had to consider that OTHER people had more information than I do, but couldn’t do a lot about it, 
for various reasons that probably relate to matters of national security.

The truth is that Ryan is not someone ANYBODY should take lightly. He is extremely dangerous.
While his dick may be equivalent to being an anesthesiologist, so small, you won’t feel a thing... 
…there’s a joke right there that’s supposed to be funny, but it probably doesn’t come off that way.

He didn’t do this shit alone, he did plenty to distance himself from these things unfolding.
Even if you have people “do this” or “do that”, the command is still issued and it reveals a PATTERN.

So, if it just fuckin’ somehow LOOKS like NEW car companies can’t survive in a car industry...
...it’s probably because some dude came around and either killed an idea, or a person... and people were 
left in mystery. But, this can be applied to any industry at all, really.

Like, for example, the guy in the 80’s that found a way to extend the mileage of a vehicle, from 
10 miles a gallon, to 100 miles a gallon. The guy didn’t kill himself, did he...?

Even if he DID, sorta looks TOO coincidental. TOO coincidental means, it was no coincidence at all.
So like, if I’m walking through a school, and I run into the same person 8 fuckin’ times in like 10 minutes...
… that person’s probably Goku. Son of a bitch keeps fuckin’ teleporting all over the place, running into me again.
What an asshole, bro. Wave your “OooooOOhHhh look I can teleport, and YOU can’t~!” in my face, why don’t ya...?

That’s a metaphor, teleportation doesn’t exist. 
It is a pattern, however. 
Like the guy I mentioned in the 80’s, every guy that’s ever had a good idea on how to extend fuel economy 
meant less money for the oil/gas companies. 

There’s NO WAY that they did somethin’ SHADY, is there...?                                          (← FALLACY ALERT)
OBVIOUSLY... they were just as willing to make 1/10th the amount of money, as anyone else.
How cool does that sound...? “Make 1 tenth of what you make now~!”
Less money to go around~!

You’re probably reading that and thinking “...what? Makes no sense...”

Right, what I said probably doesn’t make any sense at all. 
Everybody wants MORE money. Not LESS... so inflation just keeps rising, and nobody knows how to stop it.

OH WAIT, YEAH SOMEBODY DOES KNOW HOW TO STOP IT... THAT PERSON BEING ME, BASICALLY...

If all those dudes with amazing ideas all just, CONVENIENTLY APPEAR as if they MIGHT all have been TAKEN OUT 
INTENTIONALLY... that is something that a real evil (prick/CAPITALIST) would do, to make more money.

Until a PRESIDENT was like “Hold up ya fucks~! Nah. It ain’t goin’ down like that boss man...”

Cars getting 10 times more mileage, means they’ll get A LOT LESS MONEY... Whoa. Cool, it is a PERFECT MOTIVE.
...if you’re a fuckin’ psycho who doesn’t think they’ll ever get CAUGHT, that is.

Whoever bought that “formula”, AND killed that dude, should be given a state issued “death penalty”.
Because that is beyond a shadow of a doubt, why the planet is in a fuckin’ crisis right now.

But, because they do these things QUIETLY (if you have nothing nice to say, then say nothing at all), then INTENT 
is much harder to PROVE. Doesn’t mean OTHERS won’t see the fuckin’ PATTERN, and take an EXTREME NOTICE and ALERT.
(believe it or not, but crows remember a person’s face whenever they kill one of their own, and they remember that 
shit for a REALLY LONG TIME... ← evil fuckfaced capitalists would’ve never made it very far in their world)

And that is why guys like Ryan get themselves fuckin’ caught, and bring everyone involved along with him.
Including Master Sheriff Michael Zurlo, and Captain Cooper.

So it stands to reason that I just whipped out a real compelling motivation that laid beneath the surface.
Michael Zurlo, is pissed with himself now... just like Ryan. 

This hidden government exists, and they play games with people, and 
they kill people. Michael Zurlo, had better fuckin’ hope, that other people don’t kill him. Because a lot of
people trusted this cocksucker, and he’s been doin’ some real shady shit, just like Ryan has. Coordination too.

Whether Ryan or my aunt have some involvement in my father’s death, then it causes me to want to understand why.
If Terri had something to do with my father being killed... I’d like to fuckin’ know why.
Because, it might be the reason why the triggerman was never named during the trials for my father’s murder.
I wouldn’t fuckin’ think this at all... if I didn’t see a bunch of dudes that work for SCSO and the NYSP...
casually ignore me repeatedly. 

I have NO DOUBT that I have pissed off a lot of people at SCSO, NYSP, FBI, NSA, CISA, DOD, CIA, or whatever... 
But- people should really put up more of a fight with their WORDS and IDEAS when they know they’re right, rather 
than physically. Physically is dangerous. Even a guy like Ryan has to worry someone COULD shoot him.

I’m gonna say it right here and now, I’m gonna lose my fuckin’ cool in this document/book.
At the end of the day, some of these agencies have to accept, some of em fucked up. 
I really don’t blame the NSA or CISA, or really anything after the first (3) agencies in the list above.
It’s not really supposed to be their fuckin’ job, to investigate people, but I know they will do it.

And if those agencies that were supposed to do the job don’t want to accept they fucked up... 
...then it makes the PATTERN EVEN MORE CLEAR.
Doesn’t give me the right to EXECUTE/HURT people willy nilly either, but something has to change.

Can’t just “hope” or have “faith” that everything will work itself out, either.
HOPE and FAIGHT need to be combined with EFFORT and RESOLVE.

The people who work at those organizations, if they HAVE “INTEGRITY”, they have to accept that the only way to 
resolve this, is by coming clean. That’s what I mean by “integrity check”. Every law ever written, or currently
being enforced, from top → bottom, they all need to be revised and rewritten from scratch. Cause some cuntfaced 
fuckbag from England came over here, and spiked the fuckin’ punchbowl...

          Don’t be ALARMED or anything, but the punch has been spiked with alcohol.
AA#1    : You serious dude...? 
          I’ve been sober for over 25 years.
AA#2    : I’ve been sober for over 40.
AA#3    : I’m only like a week in...
AA#4    : 5 years sober here...

AA#1-4  : Yeh.
Person1 : FUCK.

So, everybody at the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting had to “restart” their clean date...
Cause if they ALL pretend like they didn’t know that shit was spiked... NONE OF THEM ARE TELLING THE TRUTH.

What if NOBODY EVER TOLD THE TRUTH, LIKE, EVER...? (← Something to really think about)

What happens, is that people will be like...

Guy : I have 30 years sober. 
      Except, the (1) drink I got tricked into drinking last week. 
      Just went on a 5 day drinking binge. 
      Other than that though, I’ve been sober 30 years... to the day.

Ah, yeah. It’s like Prince Andrew being seen sucking Andrew Cuomo’s dick, right...? 
And then he stops, and they both say, “Hey, neither one of us are gay.”
And then Prince Andrew starts blowing him some more.

If that sounds fuckin’ stupid, oh well. That’s what tyranny and corruption are.
The REASON why girls get GROSSED OUT when they SEE shit like that, is because they realize that whoever they 
thought could be the father of a child, can never do that now. 
Not in THEIR mind. 

She saw some dude blowing some other dude, and THAT’S why Britanny Commisso couldn’t fathom waxing Cuomo’s candle. 
It grossed her out when he came onto her, because SHE KNOWS WHAT THE DUDE DOES... 

The Constitution was meant to have a fair level of CONCISION for key reasons. It is not a SHORT document either.
But they didn’t fuckin’ sit around playing with each other’s dicks and think “Hey, maybe all 8 of the founding
fathers are the only exception when it comes to fondling some other dude’s dick or somethin’... ya know?”

Nah. Cause they would hold themselves accountable to their own laws.

Revising all of the laws in every scope, WON’T BE EASY... but there are plenty of people to get it done.
Pretty sure that the the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, they’re fine. 
The USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001, is a serious fucking problem. But with enough thought, it could also be amended.

Everything that SOUNDS REASONABLE, that doesn’t provide somebody with exceptions where they are the only person 
in the world that can go to any Applebee’s on Tuesday, whip his dick out, and say: 
“THIS IS NOT MY FUCKIN’ DICK RIGHT HERE, YA FUCKS... HA HA HA HA HA” and then, take off...
...without being arrested for indecent exposure.

Everybody will start talking about the Tuesday-at-Applebees-Flash-n-dash dude, askin’ each other:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Person 1 : Hey, Person 2, who do you think is faster, actual Flash from the comics...?
           ...or this Tuesday-at-Applebees-Flash-n-dash douchebag?
Person 2 : *throws hands up* Look bro, I don’t even wanna think about it. 
           But, as long as he does it every Tuesday at an Applebees...? 
           He’s not breakin’ the law. 
           It sounds pretty unconstitutional to me, but- oh well. 
           What can anybody do about it...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

The principle being, the fine print in a lot of laws need to be given a REAL good look.
Otherwise the human race just has to adopt the mentality of “Oh well. Nothing anybody can do about it...”

So in the future, dudes might be bigger than Dwayne the Rock Johnson, but if some governor in the future wants
that dude to suck his dick on national television, he’ll HAVE to. He might be a real tough dude, but, a leader
even said “It’s the law, buddy...” So then, a dude who could rip a guy like Cuomo in half, has to get down
on his knees, and suck away man... “Oh well. What can anybody do about it, really...?”

That is bound to piss some people off. “They better NOT fuckin’ think like that, in the future...”
You don’t know, they might. They already think like that NOW, in a lot of cases.

Nothing FATAL about the above hypothetical scenario, Applebee’s dude whipped out his dick, said somethin’ 
that made NO sense, and just, took the fuck off, man... Totally legal for HIM to do that, not you.

People might think I’m being fuckin’ ridiculous right now, but Ted Cruz gets `$500M from Exxon Mobil (which is
bribery), and lives an amazing life. Why...? Because he literally allows Exxon Mobil to fuck him in his ass.
Laws being written that make NO FUCKING SENSE. That’s why.

It’s not just the LAWS, but also the PEOPLE, the AGENCIES and their ETHICS... 
Real life situation (Philadelphia): If a police officer ACCIDENTALLY shoots an innocent bystander who’s an
8-year old girl during a shootout with a couple teenagers, you can’t fuckin’ charge those teenagers with the
murder that the officer committed. That’s just SHEER INSANITY BRO. However, that is what they did.

That shit pisses me off. When I heard about it, I kept saying “Those teenagers didn’t kill that little girl.”
Just to be clear, I’m not failing to consider that it was ACCIDENTAL, because I obviously know that.

I can’t expect that any of these organizations have the ABILITY or DESIRE to do all that “work”, reviewing 
all of the laws, realizing that someone has been being handed millions of dollars because nobody gave a shit 
meanwhile a bunch of people got shot in schools, hospitals, concerts, etc. To say that I’m exaggerating, 
would be incredibly reckless. Because not everybody has a corrupt sense of morality, AND, anybody can be
shown how to rebuild their morality. You can’t just blame the individual, you also have to blame society 
as a whole. Because, the individuals didn’t make themselves that way, society did.

Maybe people may WILLINGLY choose to change the way they think, make the right decisions with the right 
persuasive elements. Regardless of whether that’s the case, I’m just going to expect the idea to have 
PLENTY OF RESISTANCE...

Step 1) Here’s how logic works. 
Step 2) Here’s what YOU get paid to do
Step 3) Here’s what YOU’RE not doing
Step 4) Resolve this immediately.

I have a feeling that they just don’t give a shit. Do I think everybody thinks like this...? No. 
BUT- sometimes in order to (TAKE/RESTORE) ACCOUNTABILITY on behalf of other people...
...because they have reliably proven that they CANNOT do that on their own...
...I have to operate on the assumption that it DEFINITELY DOES MEAN THAT.

Does SOCIETY need LAWS that are NEVER ENFORCED...? Nope. You know who DOES though...? 
People who want those laws to APPEAR to be a RULE, for OBEDIENCE, not to QUESTION AUTHORITY.
THEN, people who ARE     (cool enough/royalty)... continue doing that. 
      People who ARE NOT (cool enough/royalty)... are charged with a crime. 
^ That is the definition of tyranny and oppression 

Benjamin Franklin always said “It is the DUTY of every CITIZEN, to QUESTION AUTHORITY.” Here’s why → 

If you see man #1 with man #2’s DICK in man #1’s mouth, that means that BOTH man #1 AND man #2, are GAY.
EXCEPT: If man 1 or 2 is Prince Andrew, you never saw him do this. Even if that’s exactly what it looks like... 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prince Andrew seen w/ mans dick in mouth   → Not gay | Any other man seen w/ mans dick in mouth → gay
Hillary Clinton leaks classified documents → Legal   | Any other man leaks classified documents → 175 y/prison
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
^ That’s how (BRITISH MONARCHY-ROYALTY/US GOVERNMENT) currently works

NOW, I’m gonna use the word COOL, because it’s a word that describes something IMPRESSIVE.
                            ----                           ------------------------------
The CURRENCY in COOL factor, is: people being fucking absolutely IMPRESSED.
    --------    -----------                   ----------------------------
Somebody gets pounded in the butt like Ted Cruz...? Nobody can pull that off like HIM. COOL.
-----------------------------------------------                                        ----

You fuckin’ chop 30 bricks made out of cement with your hand, break every brick, hand stays fine? COOL.
            ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----
But when you think back on how HIGHLY IMPRESSED you were by some dude chopping a stack of 30 bricks...
versus Ted Cruz getting’ his asshole stretched out just a tad bit more...? 
You really have to QUESTION why the terms have equivalency at all. Cause one is “GAY”, the other is “COOL AF”

Why is Ted Cruz’ ability to get pounded in the butt considered COOL, when that’s not what COOL means...?
…cause that’s GAY. It’s not FALSE, to say that’s not COOL, that’s GAY. Ya know? Like, what the fuck man...?

Welcome to the argument I’ve been making, and it’s called “America”.
Land of the free/enslaved and home of the brave/afraid | ← People will take offense, PRINCPLE/CONTEXT is accurate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Makes no fuckin’ sense for a reason. This place is an utter contradiction, because some asshole spiked the punch.
      ----------------       ------                   -------------------          -----------------------------
What I said, makes plenty of sense.  | What America tells itself and others, doesn’t make any sense at all.
             ---------------------                                           -----------------------------
What America really is, however... is “compromised from top to bottom”, because Britain came right back after it
got it’s ass kicked between 1776-1812. Just kept coming around and spiking the god damn punch again.
-------------------------------------                              --------------------------------
I’m pretty sure that some of these things will be quite alarming to some people, but to the rest of the 
population this is all bound to make plenty of fuckin’ sense. Cause “Absolute power corrupts absolutely”.

It’s why I started this document talking about Benjamin Franklin. Cause this Silence Dogood motherfucker 
wrote the god damn rules on how to write some kick ass stories. One of those stories was NON-FICTION, 
it’s called The Constitution of 1787.

I have no doubt that Ted Cruz is gonna wave off this whole document, and be like “Who gives a rats ass man...?”
Uh, pretty sure some people are gonna wanna hold him accountable.

If TED CRUZ, can fuckin’ accept bribery, from Exxon Mobil, then who’s above the law?
Nobody is above the law, it’s just an irrelevant law meant to make people be big pussies cause a law was written.
Doesn’t mean the law matters at all.  It matters when YOU as a citizen that isn’t as cool as TED CRUZ, would do 
that, but as long as you’re as important as TED CRUZ, then you’re good, man. Don’t even worry about it.

So like, they pass a law where nobody can drive drunk, cause you can kill people pretty easily doing that.
Ted Cruz can fuckin’ do that. He could drive drunk, kill 19 kids and 2 teachers, and the cops will let him go.

Or like, Andrew Cuomo can ask as many women to have sex with him as he feels like, no matter how many say no.
Normally someone would be charged with sexual harassment, but he’s exceptional. 

Or like, if it’s considered cheating if a dude bangs some girl that’s not his wife, 
Except if it’s Brad Pitt, he can bang whoever, it’s not considered cheating.

Or like, what if the President commits an act of treason, they should be charged with a prison sentence,
Unless you’re George W. Bush, then it’s just a cool story about a fucked up country that has no sense.

The key term in EACH of those above statements is “AS LONG AS...”     | ← People need to be concerned about these.
So statements that include: “But”, “Except”,”Unless”, or “As long as” | ← People need to be concerned about these.
                                                                      --------------------------------------------
Not questioning authority, or keeping them in check, means they’ll try to do whatever the fuck they want.

If I see Prince Andrew blowing some other dude, I’m not gonna pretend I didn’t see that.
Just like Ms. Guiffre, literally standing next to this fuckin’ moron in a picture, and it took *checks watch*
like 20 fuckin’ years for people to do something about it. Why did it take 20 years...? Well, it’s because people
have to repeat themselves over and over, until finally people are able to disassemble and reprocess the scenario.

Like, if it’s fuckin’ cool to say (2+2=5), people will keep sayin’ it. Then when you say “Nah, it isn’t... (2+2=4)”
People like Heather Brondi are gonna say “Listen ya fuck... the popular kids all say, 2+2=5. Get a life.”
And that is why I occasionally have to insult people, because, that’s retarded. I need to get a life though.
Pretty sure I had one when I managed the Computer Answers shop, and someone used an exploit on my smartphone, 
and basically some people did a lot of illegal shit to get rid of me. Somehow I’m the asshole here.

Well, no, the alternative is that I just find a compelling way to instantiate that HER and ALL those popular kids 
were WRONG that WHOLE entire time. Might be curious why I keep dropping her name in the document, there’s a reason.
...it’s because it BECAME a MEASURE OF PRIDE at one point. Now it’s literally a bunch of people that have no ground
to stand on, that are trying to sink into the chair and not look like a fuckin’ fool. Oh well. Too bad.

Like the GIF of Homer Simpson backing up into the bushes. | ← Don’t do that. Take accountability.

...are a lot like: asking some girl “Wanna choke on a big fat dick...?” It is an extremely aggressive 
strategy, but I gotta say, the fact that a man asked that question in record time...? That’s gonna be a bit of
a turn on for THEM. So you get (2) things out there, and she might just fuckin’ say “Hell yeah...~! I love

That girl provided some resistance... but probably started thinking about it. 
Then she’s like “Wait... I do actually wanna do that...”
The reason being, they like a real big fat one. Even if it’s not fat, they’ll still check it out. 
They actually can’t help it sometimes.

        Take em off. 
        We’re doin’ some stuff.

$Book.AddSection(5,"Control",@"
You can’t expect everyone else in the world is gonna care about things like RESPECT and DECENCY. 
Believe it or not, these things paint a pretty good picture of someone’s INTEGRITY → HONESTY → TRUSTWORTHINESS
This strategy WORKS, but like I said, it’s a fuckin’ exploit. 

That means, that’s how easy it’ll be is for someone else to walk up to YOUR girlfriend, 
and bang the snot out of her.
Probably won’t feel that good once you realize “Easy come, easy go.”

Even if you work at a relationship with someone, and throw a fuckin’ `$5M diamond ring on her finger...
...pretty sure that anybody would get pissed, 
if some scruffy lookin’ dude got in her pants in the first sentence.

The reason why this is RELEVANT, is because this is how people should consider (businesses/agencies), to act.
Having FAITH alone, is... fucking moronic.

Apply this concept to mobile telephone service providers, as well as the manufacturers. 
These service providers actually save ALL of the data that is SENT/RECEIVED when people use their service. 
That means, if you have service, every CONVERSATION AUDIO FILE, TEXT MESSAGE, DICK PIC/SELFIE, whatever. 
ALL of the (DATA/0,1) that is ACTUALLY TRANSMITTED, it gets SAVED somewhere PERMANENTLY, bub.
That does not mean that they’re gonna rip open every fuckin’ god damn thing ya ever did, and say:
    “Oh he fuckin’ Google searched some shit...? Alright... Prison.” | ← They’re not doin’ that YET

Now, if I happen to be correct about that (and I am cause that’s how binary works), can anyone really expect 
that asking those providers for a specific phone call, will allow them to easily obtain that information...? 
Well, no. 
They’ll tell everyone: court subpoena, fuckface. 
They can even deny the court subpoena too. “Oh, sorry officer/court... seems like the data is just... gone...~!”
They will either SAY that THEY 1) DO, here ya go, 2) DON’T, and lied or 3) DON’T (but someone else does).

It’s legal for them to lie to ANYBODY about its existence, whether OPENLY, or by OMISSION.
Q: Why would they do that though...? It’s a SERIOUS QUESTION ACTUALLY.

Following an example that other people left for em. That’s why. So if Clinton gets his dick sucked by Monica...
...oh man. What if everybody does that too...? The lying part. Not everybody getting blown by Monica... 

They fuckin’ definitely have it somewhere. All calls. Text messages. Emails. 
The only thing they can’t really duplicate is actual mail. Anyway...

I believe the reason why, is because of the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001.
Which stands to reason, who has the control here...?
Does the device manufacturer have MORE control over that device...? Or does the service provider...?
The answer is that neither one has more control. Someone else does. 

There’s something in the middle each and every time. 
That thing in the middle, is the National Security Agency.
“We’re the National Security Agency, fuckfaces. The end all, be all, of agencies that deal with matters of...
...guess what...? … national security. Bet you fucks didn’t know that, huh?”

Now, will they tell people that...? Nah. Cause it’s in the name, dude. 
They don’t have to to around, tellin’ people “OooOoOoooHHhhh, guess what motherfucker...?”
“...what, you’re the National Security Agency, you deal with matters of national security...?”
“...yeh, actually...”

Cause it’s part of their name, and you just ripped the wind right out of their sails.

| Nikola Tesla |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The Federal Communication Commission was the agency in charge of reverse engineering Nikola Tesla’s 
wireless technology, and then calling it their shit, even though it is a private entity.
Yeah, it’s a federal agency, but the intellectual property actually belongs to a man that died.
It doesn’t stop them from taking his shit and doing what they want anyway.

The FCC has taken a lot of Nikola Tesla’s intellectual property and put a huge TAX on it.
Nikola Tesla ALSO came up with Alternating Current/Electricity. That also has a huge TAX on it too.

So, if they do it, then the service provider, AND the manufacturer will also do that, so (3) copies of
the data are saved. The USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001 allows the content of ALL domestic communications within
the United States, to be saved and archived. As well as, external communication with whatever. 
So, the “Five Eyes” (not Five Guys) have access to whatever America does.

There’s a key reason why. It’s mainly because phones are being monitored by foreign spies, like RUSSIA, CHINA.
I probably look like the biggest fuckin’ idiot in the world talking in circles about ALL this shit, but at the 
end of the day, they may as well give everyone else in the world, access to the same information.

These people can determine with sheer certainty, if a device is being exploited somehow in the middle of a call.
Or like, somebody’s adding lines of extra pixels in a word document. Or auto-saving my document FOR me, so that 
I don’t even have to. (The name of this exploit is called SCRIBBLES, or it is a DERIVATIVE of SCRIBBLES)

A long time ago, I didn’t think anyone would really wanna do something like that, but, now I know that shit is 
real. And then also, so is censorship, and basically attacking people for capitalist ideas to become rich... 
doesn’t make a lot of sense when you realize the government stole a dead man’s property and taxed the shit out 
of it just like the tea in 1776... and then people will literally kill one another over money.

Unless you begin to realize that maybe some asshole from Britain, came over and spiked the fuckin’ punch bowl.
I don’t think people realize how immoral everyone is. Money is apparently more important than right or wrong.

Anyway, I’m not gonna say that the NSA is inherently EVIL by any means, cause it isn’t.
But Edward Snowden leaked files that showed how people were ABUSING THESE PROGRAMS.

The NSA isn’t the only agency that can DO this, but they are TYPICALLY the ones to exploit those calls WITHOUT 
being detected. ANYONE ELSE can sure as shit be detected though. So, if you need help from the professionals, 
since there might be a serial killer workin’ at the FBI...? Well, maybe the NSA is actually an organization that 
happens to be wall-to-wall coverage, of the fiercest fuckin’ cybercommandos known to man. 

I keep havin’ these visions of this real hot girl that works at the National Security Agency

The reason all of these things appear to be happening is because of the HIDDEN GOVERNMENT.
It’s like this, they said “You can’t just give away free shit bro. Fuck off.”

Then they decided that it’d be cool if they sold electricity, and phone service, and now everybody pays for it.
But the reason why everybody pays for it is because they don’t know that it’s a free technology.
I don’t think people realize how how bad the problem is, and it all comes down to the fact that they literally 
think they own people. 

Like, that’s what Surveillance Capitalism is. 
They make YOU pay for the service that they provide, even though you don’t actually have to pay for service 
and they have access to your device. So, if I own a service provider, I don’t have to pay jack shit. But, if 
I want to know what someone like Michael Cook is doing on a device he paid for, well, I can activate a
connection to his device, even if he’s not paying for service... it’s totally “offline”. 

“THE DEVICE IS DISABLED, FUCK YOU BRO, NO COOL SHIT WAS ON IT ANYWAY, HAHAHA.”   (← This will happen to other people)

Which means, the people in control probably have no idea that I’m gonna teach the common every day person, 
how to manipulate these authorities into abusing their powers and get caught red-handed.
NOT for being a dickhead to get free shit or whatever, but because SOMEBODY is abusing their authority.
Because once they start doing that to people, they will not fuckin’ stop. I’m absolutely fuckin’ serious.

They’ve been hooking everybody up with a device that can do 20 things at once, and fits in your pocket, and 
can be used as either a tool or a weapon... and if they want ya dead, they have so many ways to make it happen.
UNLESS, suppose the FCC had competition...? For instance, take the technology, and replicate it.

“Free cell service, using the existing infrastructure.”
What could they really do about it? “OoOoOooHhh that’s OUR shit that we rightfully stole from Nikola Tesla.”
If you start talking about stuff like this, it’s bound to piss off a number of people that commit crimes willy 
nilly, so they stole a dead man’s ideas, and everybody just pays for it just like the TEA TAX. Cool.

This is a serious problem because that means they can CAPTURE original ideas that people have.
And, even if you legitimately come up with an idea on paper and patent it, oh well. 
As soon as you get to the patent office, now it’s theirs.

Even if you legitimately can prove that an idea was yours beyond a shadow of a doubt, as soon as you patent the 
idea, that’s when it becomes theirs. So the only thing you can do is to fabricate the idea, instead of patenting 
the idea. So, patents are basically garbage now. Think about the process of patenting an idea. Someone is gonna 
be able to see someone creating the patent on a computer, or submitting it into a digital record. 

Yeah, I’m playing around with the idea that all of this is happening. 
Assuming it IS happening, isn’t a bad idea.

If you have a means of FABRICATION, then you can just MAKE the thing, and then patent it afterward.
What can anybody do, if you do that...? Hm...? “OoooOoOOOhhhHHh DUDE BUILT A THING BEFORE PATENTING IT... WOW.”
People think I’m fuckin’ joking that some asshole somewhere, will try to steal some really amazing ideas BEFORE 
that person can even get that idea to market. Then, suddenly...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

You  : WHOA, I CAME UP WITH THAT FUCKIN IDEA BRO...
Them : The fuck you did, buddy.
       I had that idea 20 years ago, so... fuck off chum.
You  : ...really...?
Them : Yeah, your idea I MEAN, my idea isn’t really all that cool anyway.
You  : But, you just said my idea, then you changed it to your idea...
Them : Listen dude. 
       Fuck you and your idea, it’s mine NOW fuckface.
       HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH~!

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Yeah, so... they will be VERY BLATANT and OBVIOUS, but the FEELING when you see it, will make people sick.
            -------------------------------------      --------------------------------------------------
Because I think, some people will play games, and kill people... and I have caught this shit happening to me.

| FBI Investigator Ryan Ward | AKA my step-cousin |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The way I see it is that somebody was actually following me on the 22nd, and the 23rd, and the 24th, 
and the 25th, and the people that might’ve been doin’ that are these fuckin’ kids that know my cousin Ryan. 

These (2) guys that attacked me on May 26th, 2020 are serial killers in conjunction with my cousin Ryan Ward.
My cousin Ryan Ward has specifically told me, he is a serial killer, he has killed a lot of people.
Whether that may have been part of his JOB DESCRIPTION, or he was HIRED AS A MERCENARY... is another matter.
He is part of a collective that has the ability to commandeer <ANY> smartphone, or computer, in the world...
...connected to the internet.

I don’t believe Ryan Ward has actually DONE anything to me to warrant DIRECT INVOLVEMENT with an ATTEMPTED MURDER,
beside FACILITATION OF MURDER. But, that probably sounds ridiculous right there without some specifics.
One way or the other, it IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE, that Michael Zurlo and Ryan Ward, played a game that went too far. 
They both have the 1) means, 2) motivation, fit a 3) profile that indicates → they are each a THREAT

Once you have identified a THREAT, it stands to reason that they will never stop being one.
              -------------------                           ------------------------------
Because, they have to be SHOWN being able to process REASON. 
If they’re playing a game that went too far, they 
   weren’t playing a game that went too far at all. 

They were tryin’ to kill ya, and then they IDENTIFIED themselves.
THEY are BOTH ASSOCIATED with the (2) individuals who ATTACKED me on May 26th, 2020 outside of:

Michael Zurlo is not involved with CVE-2019-8936, but most definitely FACILITATED an ATTEMPTED MURDER,
tried to cover it up, which is basically OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, but I also think he is part of a RICO.

Ryan Ward is not involved in the ATTEMPTED MURDER, but is most definitely involved with CVE-2019-8936, and,
CENSORSHIP of another citizen, CYBERSTALKING, HARASSMENT, CORPORATE ESPIONAGE, REGULAR ESPIONAGE, and 
distributing PEGASUS/PHANTOM to my smartphone PRIOR to January 2019, and is part of a RICO.

He probably wasn’t ALONE in doing these things, either. Nah. A RICO, is a ring of organized crime.
Sometimes a RICO is a ring of corrupt people in the government that basically do the same shit as the mafia.
A WAY less cool version of the Sopranos, except, at the county, state, or even federal level.

Typically when RYAN WARD might be FUCKING with a cousin of his, he’s gonna take a lot of pride in the fact 
that I’m just his annoying cousin who’s dad was murdered in 1995, so he ASSUMED that I’d never actually 
notice or detect the ‘feeling’ that he was behind all of that... but he had a lot of help.

What I just said should confuse people immeasurably. Why would he take PRIDE in doing these things...?
It is simply because he WANTED to get CAUGHT and he was ROOTING for me, because... 
...it is literally a phenomenon of the human psyche where the smartest people in the world know they’re 
surrounded by total morons every fucking day. | (← Society can change and heal itself, if you try)

None of those morons ever fuckin’ come CLOSE to thinking that “OoohhhhoOohhh, fuckin’ … maybe there’s an 
FBI man with an axe to grind cause I almost fucked his girlfriend 20 years ago, and he thought I’d forget 
about it, and MAN... she was FUCKIN HOT THOUGH...” | (← Realistically...? I moved on a long time ago)

Cause, she was. Tati Cleveland was at or about one of the top 5 hottest girls in a class of like 800 people.
And you know what, no girl ever says “How DARE you call me one of the hottest girls you’ve ever seen...”

Nah. Cause, that’s retarded. If anything she’ll probably say “Should’ve said that sooner dude. Wtf.”

Let’s do the math real quick... 800 / 2 (gender: male, female) ~ 400. This girl and I would play this game of 
10 dimensional chess too, but it was pretty obvious that she was upset with me for NOT trying to get in her 
pants, cause she was dating my cousin. Sorta had an “immoral” feeling to it, too. Didn’t mean that I wasn’t
fuckin’ thinkin’ about it, cause obviously I will put it out there, I wanted to bang the snot outta this girl.

So, realistically, I’d probably could’ve saved myself a lot of trouble, by telling my conscious to fuck off.
1/400, 2/400, 3/400, 4/400, 5/400 ← when a female happens to be one of those girls right there... What do ya do?
Do you... 

    1) tell your conscious “Hey, fuck off dude...” and then demolish that girls rear end...? or,
    2) listen to your conscious “meh, she’s fuckin’ hot as hell though... wtf.” and then watch a bunch of porn?
    3) bang some other girls instead

Well, I did a variety of option 2 and 3, cause hey, maybe doing 1) is actually immoral AND unethical.
...that is, if they were in a relationship.
I don’t think they’ve seen each other or spoken to each other in years, but that would be an assumption.

BUT- trying to kill somebody after failing miserably over and over at a bunch other questionable shit...
...is grounds for me to say “OoooHoOooOOooohhhHHhh, girls dating my cousin...? Fuck it. I’m goin’ in boys.”

$Book.AddSection(5,"Skit [~] Tatiana Cleveland",@"
Tati : Well, hello Michael.
Me   : Tati...
Tati : What are ya doin’ here...? 
Me   : Ohhh, you know why I’m here.
Tati : I mean, do I...?
Me   : Yeah. It’s... been fate the whole time.
Tati : Yeah I kinda saw this day comin’ at some point... *wags her ass* Got the goods still. 
Me   : Ryan is a fuckface. 
       Sorta did some really illegal shit to me, and had Michael Zurlo help him out.
Tati : Oh nos! 
       That’s terrible, Michael... 
       What ever will YOU do...?
Me   : *chuckles* Form a militia and then have the cuffs thrown around both of their wrists...
       ...and escort the both of them to a TRIAL...
       ...and then tell the police officers to STEP ASIDE...
       ...and then drag both of these fuckin’ morons to prison.
Tati : How can you actually do that though, I mean, 1) works for the FBI, the 2) is the county sheriff...?
Me   : Using the Constitution to form a militia. 
       Or just, join one that already exists. 
       I can’t go to either organization, cause once ya say “Someone that works here is committing a crime...”,
       they will actually ignore that person. Maybe they don’t, and I just CONSISTENTLY have shitty luck.
Tati : Sounds like you’ve got your work cut out for ya.
Me   : I wouldn’t have needed to write this document, if I had a feeling that I was being ignored.
       It’s why I wrote you that letter.
       Never took you for an idiot, but I’m certain that a lot of people are morons.
       I had compelling evidence the entire time.
Tati : So I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do. 
       Or what you’re askin’ me...
Me   : Might need your help. 
       At some point it just looks like I have to show people...
       ...that a citizen such as myself, was targeted at Computer Answers...
       ...and that a lot of law men thought I was just being DELUSIONAL, right...? 
       But they never 1) collected my evidence.
Tati : That just sounds delusional right there though...
Me   : That they never collected my evidence? 
       I know, but it’s true.
Tati : Nah, I meant all that stuff ya said, sounds delusional.
Me   : Yeah it’s not delusional at all. 
       You were one of the hottest girls in high school.
Tati : ...that’s accurate, not delusional...
Me   : Your nickname for Ryan (was/is) “pencil dick”.
Tati : ...also accurate, not delusional...
Me   : Zurlo has a son named Paul, and he’s not a “killer”.
Tati : I didn’t know that, but, ok...? 
       Maybe...?
Me   : Which means that Michael Zurlo was playing this one close to the chest and didn’t even tell his son.
       The reason I know that is because Tim Berlin asked Paul Zurlo to come to my house, and Paul Zurlo had 
       been to my house before. 
       I thought that he was involved. 
       When he came to my house with an innocent look on his face, cause Tim read my resume... 
       Paul Zurlo wasn’t an asshole and he was very polite...
       Had a different impression beforehand.
Tati : I don’t know what the hell you’re sayin’, dude...
Me   : Right, well, that’s because I’m pretty fuckin’ intelligent if you can’t tell.
Tati : What are you saying?
Me   : A lot of guys from SCSO have been very friendly and cooperative.
       I can detect when they are able to be TRUSTED. 
       Anthony Agresta, is one of those people. 
       Michael Whitacre, also. 
       Mark Sheehan, also. 
       Jeffrey Kaplan, also. 
       Joshua Welch, also. 
       So, if I can say that THEIR SUPERIOR IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY AT ALL, one of these people will be promoted...
       ...to ZURLO’S POSITION.
Tati : That’s impossible though...                                                              (← FALLACY ALERT)

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Tati just made a fallacious statement. 
That is VERY LIKELY, not impossible at all... if they have trustworthy people already working there, they’re not  
gonna be like “OoooOohh look at all the applications we got from people on LinkedIn for being a county sheriff...”
Nah. 

Still, just so I can make it rather clear, this conversation will likely never happen.
If something like this WERE to happen, it will not look or sound like this.
Cause, if you couldn’t tell already... 
...it just won’t sound like this at all, it’ll sound like something farther down...

Sometimes the story IS difficult to write.  
Cause what the hell is supposed to happen in this fake, made-up conversation...? 

MAYBE... I’m the fake one here...
And everybody else, just... leveled up on me.
Still stuck on the first level.
Barely.
Sucks.

Might even make a name for myself, for bein’ the most fake, made-up dude, that ever existed... 
How could anybody actually compete with that...?
Can’t be done. 

I’m just kidding. I’m definitely real. I’m about as real as they come, too.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me   : Nah, if I have evidence of their SUPERIOR BEING INVOLVED IN A SERIOUS OFFENSE LIKE FACILITATION OF 
       MURDER, (2) of those officers were unknowingly involved in that, and are therefore, KEY WITNESSES.
Tati : What type of evidence do you have...?
Me   : Like, evidence of a video I recorded on a disabled iPhone, that I showed to Shaemus Leavey on May 27th.
       He can like, be called upon as a witness. 
       Because, the State Police actually earned my respect even after the videos I made roasting some of them
       for leavin’ their cars running outside. 
       I would’ve been pissed about the video TOO if I were one of them, but- at no point did I think a single
       State Trooper was doin’ this shit where people at SCSO were acting shady in some cases. 
       Captain Jeffrey Brown GAVE ME THE INTERACTION → SCSO-2020-028501, 
       Joshua Welch gave me → SCSO-2020-027797. 
       Michael Whiteacre gave me → Contact information for Joshua Welch.
       Jeffrey Kaplan followed Scott Schelling to a SECONDARY LOCATION in that first ticket number.
       That first ticket number was left out of my records request that I submitted on September 4th, 2020.
       It was the most important ticket number I needed. 
       Why...? Scott Schelling was about to kill me. 
       I’m fucking adamantly CERTAIN that he was going to. 
       When I told him about the footage at Center for Security, well... someone went there and deleted it.
       But you know what they COULD NOT DELETE...?
Tati : ...what?
Me   : *chuckles* The audio logs that I uploaded at Computer Answers. 
       Wanna know whats on all of em...?
Tati : What’s that...?
Me   : Timestamps. AND, me mentioning YOU and RYAN, and that YOU would testify on a witness stand, that Ryan’s 
       a serial killer.
Tati : Why would you suggest something like that...? 
       Maybe I’m not as smart as YOU think I am.
Me   : Bullshit. 
       Nah, you... can’t play dumb with ME missy. 
       You weren’t just one of the hottest girls in school,
       … you were also pretty fuckin’ smart.
Tati : *grumble grumble* I dunno bro. 
       Sounds like the most fake compliment I’ve ever heard.
Me   : I meant it.
Tati : If Ryan IS a serial killer, so what...? 
       Oh well. 
       Nothin’ anybody can do about it...
       Might as well just, give up dude...
       Find a rock, and just...
       Climb under it...
Me   : Yeah there is. 
       I think you’re terrified of this dude. 
       I’m not, pisses him off too...
Tati : When you say “terrified”, what are you referring to that’s so terrifying about him...?
Me   : I mean, think about it, he has a dick that he could sharpen, and use as a writing utensil.
       He could really hurt somebody with that thing...
       ...but he’ll never make a girl squirt all over the place...
       ...number 2 pencils aren’t real good for that.
Tati : I mean, he’s got a pencil dick, so what...? 
       I *ALMOST* had an orgasm with this kid like, every time we had sex...
Me   : Almost.
Tati : Yeah, almost. 
       Who cares if he never made me violently orgasm when we had sex, dude...?
       He *ALMOST* did, a lot of times.
       Thousands, even.
       That’s gotta count for somethin’...
Me   : *chuckles* Ooohhh well, I’m sure you care.
Tati : *crosses her arms* Yeah. 
       Maybe I do, actually... 
       *looks out the window* Fuckin’ pencildick fuckface... *grumble*
       You did some shit that wasn’t all that fuckin’ cool either, bub.
Me   : My bad bro, guess I’ll go climb under a rock, then...
       Can’t apologize or anything like that...
Tati : You’re bein’ pretty dramatic dude.
Me   : I’ve never tried to kill anybody. 
       Not you, not anybody else, not my kids, not my worst enemy...
       Jeff Truesell was probably the worst thing I ever did to someone.
       But hey, I did that shit in self defense. 
       Most people don’t realize this, but- yeah it was self defense.
       I was surrounded by (2) people, and at any given moment, I could’ve been killed myself. 
Tati : Should’ve just fuckin’ fought these (2) dudes by yourself...
Me   : They were marking me for death. 
       515 symbols on the street in front of my house. 
       They were gonna kill me.
Tati : ...I... didn’t know that...
Me   : Right, but nobody ever asked me about it. 
       Even the Sheriffs, way back when, couldn’t do an actual investigation. 
       But they sure as hell do an amazing job of pretending like they investigate shit.
Tati : Give em’ a break.
Me   : Nah, look. (4) fucking times my mother and I called the police when Jeff kept breaking in with Zack.
       (4) times. 
       What if they broke into YOUR fucking house (1) time, or Tom Reivik’s house (1) time...
       ...then that kid would’ve probably gotten arrested.
Tati : So you’re just gonna fuckin’ bring up the past like it, could be used to paint recurring themes of 
       carelessness by police organizations or even discrimination...?
Me   : Yeah, that’s exactly what I’m doing, to make my argument much more compelling.
       I mean look at it this way... even Heather Brondi could never figure that out.
       Almost like she could’ve read half the shit I wrote, and actually helped me that entire time, but-
       chose not to instead. Chose to probably give Neil Weiner the fuckin’ recording of Judge Paul Pelagalli
       on April 6th, 2021... Maybe that’s how she “helped” me. This girl knew my father was fuckin’ killed, 
       saw all the shit that I went through afterward, and decided to do almost the same thing Ryan did, which
       was to prey on someone they thought was just weak. But- no.
Tati : ...you shouldn’t call girls a cunt, Michael... that’s like, fuckin’ extremely offensive.
Me   : OooooOOooHHhhhHh... it is...? THE PRINCIPLE, of what SHE did, to DESERVE BEING CALLED ONE, is a LOT MORE 
       OFFENSIVE than the fucking word I used. Same exact principle applies to my OWN MOTHER. She’s fuckin’ a 
       total fuckin’ moron sometimes. Cause MY FATHER TOLD MY MOTHER, “Hey, I think someone’s looking for me...”
       and my mother was like “You’re delusional bro, piss off.” So did my aunt Nancy. Luckily I know my aunt
       Nancy, isn’t a fuckin’ moron in the least. Neither is my mother actually, she’s smart as a whip, she’s 
       just... lemme tell ya, when she’s in the mood to be a dumbass, she will go to quite the extreme.
       I don’t think ALL women do that. Nancy might’ve been pissed that I kept saying “Terri had my dad killed”, 
       and she will probably keep that in the back of her mind, “Why would he even say something like that...” 
       ...because it makes a lot of sense to me. I don’t think Terri is the one who had my father killed. But- 
       she fuckin’ knows who did, and has kept it a secret this whole entire time.
Tati : So you just, expect everybody to believe this PLAUSIBLE story of yours...?
Me   : I don’t EXPECT anything, except to have to make my argument and story MORE and MORE compelling. 
       Like, if Dwayne Coonradt wants to prove to the world that he can shove gigantic objects up his asshole...
       Well, he COULD do what Heather Brondi does, starting with a little pencildick.
       Then, acclimate to baby pickles.
       Then, they could start workin’ with actual regular pickles.
       Eventually, then you can use full sized cucumbers... and that’s why the strippers at Ciro’s call Dwayne 
       “Cucumber”. Melanie Goldstein probably thinks that’s a pretty cute nickname... but, the ANALOGY here, is
       that... if that dude wants to prove to everybody that he can shove a cucumber up his ass, he’s not gonna
       start out with a cucumber-sized story.
Tati : Yeah, but you come across as an asshole...
Me   : Yeah, but being an asshole is a pretty clear an concise way to say “Facts don’t care about your feelings.”
Tati : If you’re an asshole all the time, then...
Me   : …? Then what...? I’m smarter than most people, so I have to occasionally prove that. 
       I’ll still, fuckin’ be a total asshole, right...? 
       But then, tell a girl like you to fuckin’ turn around...
       ...and get up against the fuckin’ wall... 
       ...and, you won’t even know why, but you’ll be like “...Fine...”
       you won’t even question it either, you’ll just fuckin’ know that … somehow that idea sounds good to you.
Tati : *blushing* Dude... why would I wanna turn around and face a wall? 
       Whaddya gonna do, invade my rear end...?
Me   : I’m gonna do a lot more than just invade that thing. 
       Probably get demolished in a controlled fashion...
       Like the World Trade Center on 9/11/2001... 
       Such a controlled demolition that (3) buildings collapsed, not just (2).
Tati : YEAH. I never fuckin’ understood that.
       Sounds hypothetical though, not even like a real command you’re even issuing...
Me   : That’s cause all of these stories are hypothetical, they’re not real. They’re probably realistic, and
       they’re BELIEVABLE to some extent, but- ENTERTAINING and INTERESTING being the key important details.
       Trust me, I’ll someday say “Oh, sorry Heather Brondi, for like, saying an offensive term to describe how 
       it felt to be ignored, basically exactly like my own mother. And family.
       People have a serious problem with thinking that their reputation is more important than...
       ...when they were wrong, promptly admitted it.
       Dwayne wouldn’t have ever earned my scorn, if he fuckin’ told people the truth about Philip Fox. 
       And, many other clients. 
       I really have no idea if this man shoves anything up his ass at all. 
       He probably doesn’t. 
       But, that’s me making an ASSUMPTION.
       An actual professional, wouldn’t make as many assumptions as he does.
       Whereas an actual expert like myself, will educate people on how morons like Dwayne call themselves 
       “professionals”, when they lie, cheat, steal, and hurt people.
       Dwayne Coonradt has earned himself a serious ass kicking, but... he will never get one.
       So, it stands to reason that EMBARRASSMENT is the only way to cause a man with a reputation he doesn’t 
       deserve, to have it FORCIBLY RELINQUISHED SOMEHOW.

Allow me to leave things off on a realistic note.

There’s a reason why the [cat isn’t supposed to come out of the bag, sometimes*].
Cause you don’t want to imagine something that’ll never happen, and expect that it will.
BUT- on the other hand, you don’t wanna be caught with your pants down, by something you couldn’t foresee.

Life is supposed to have some unexpected curve-balls thrown your way.

    Brown: Alright kid. 
           I feel it is MY duty, to formally ask you some questions about this incident you claim happened 
           in SCSO-2020-028501...
    Me   : Finally. 
           Holy shit, bro.
    Brown: Look... 
           ...don’t get an attitude with me if you expect me to help ya. 
           We good?
    Me   : Agreeable. 
           I’ll do my best.
    Brown: Alright. 
           So. 
           Tell me what happened that night BEFORE you were in Scott Schelling’s custody,
           in front of the Zappone dealership.
    Me   : Gladly. 
           I have actually written a number of documents about what I did that night...
    Brown: Yeah, yeah, yeah, ANYBODY can write documents. 
           I want to hear you SAY what happened...
    Me   : Fine. 
           I had been making audio recordings with my phone earlier that week, because I assaulted my stepfather 
           after he laughed at me about some mysterious dude in a blue truck that kept popping up out of nowhere 
           on Cemetery Road.
    Brown: Ok. 
           Mysterious blue truck.
           Since I’m an actual investigator and I pick up on "clues"...
           Blue... *writing down* ...truck.
           Ok.
           I’m gonna have you talk about the blue truck after you finish telling me what happened on:
           May 25th - May 26th, 2020
    Me   : Ok, I recorded this video ~ (05/23/20 2015) https://youtu.be/nD-TC0OEKjc 
           as well as this video ~ (05/25/20 1300) https://youtu.be/oJT0WG-CaE0 
           ...I’m pretty sure I pissed somebody off, because they felt like leaving their police cruisers running 
           idle, unattended, for like, *checks watch* could’ve been sitting there for hours, perhaps days or weeks. 
           I’m not sure.
    Brown: Wow, hours, days or weeks...
           ...running...?
    Me   : Maybe.
           I came back (2) days later and they were still sitting there running...
    Brown: Holy shit... 
           You’re tellin’ me you’ve had these videos this whole *checks watch* 2 years almost...?
    Me   : Yep. 
           Imagine if James Leonard or Michael Zurlo knew about these...?
    Brown: Well, I’m gonna assume that this is an EXTREMELY VITAL CLUE that you had.
           In fact, IN ONE OF THESE VIDEOS, you literally STATE that the program was on your device.
           So, you have known that someone in a police organization was using PEGASUS/PHANTOM to surveil you on your 
           iPhone, since... you literally state these things in the videos...
    Me   : Yep. 
           You’re like my new best friend, pal. 
    Brown: Look... 
           Do I work with some incredibly incompetent people...? 
           Sure. 
           Do I go around telling them that...? 
           No. 
           Gotta respect fellow officers, that includes any excuses they might have.
    Me   : Alright. 
           I stated that in the first video, that they were probably running for a reason.
           But when it becomes a pattern, then I have to make PARALLEL OBSERVATIONS, such as...
           I was walking through the woods with my son EARLIER on 5/25/20...
           ...and spoke to JOHN HOFFMAN cause he like, drove up to us COINCIDENTALLY...
           ...and he tells me about how his
           quote unquote SECURITY TEAM, basically commits fraud.
           So, the way I see it...?
           There are some rich people that are SCAMMING and committing FRAUDULENT activities, and they need to
           make their way to prison.
           AFTER their assets are frozen.
           Not BEFORE their assets are frozen, because then they’ll be able to pay for a lawyer.
           They need to have their ASSETS FROZEN FIRST.
           Then, they’re fucked.
           Michael Zurlo is one of those people, I am absolutely certain of it.
           Allowing the FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES to go unimpeded, means that taxpayers are wasting their money.
           Because I’ll tell ya, taxpayers will stop paying their taxes if this shit is caught, and Zurlo doesn’t DO
           anything about it except “Accept a report, tell those people ‘alright got it.’ and then throw that report
           in the trash.” (← What ZURLO is DOING)
           Taxpayers may as well just light another `$1T on fire.
    Brown: Exactly. 
           If the taxpayers want to burn their own money...? 
           Let em.
    Me   : I’m pretty sure the taxpayers aren’t gonna like seeing the police leaving their cruisers running in packs
           of (3-4). Nor are they gonna care for the ZURLO, CATRICALA, TANSKI, HOFFMAN committing fraud and paying
           guys in the FBI and KeyCorp to shuffle around funds between accounts. Basically what Nicholas Dinova got
           in “trouble” for, is TANSKI having an INSIDE MAN at KeyCorp. Same with Paul Amato. I’ll leave that off
           to the side for now, and allow the FBI to do what they do.
    Brown: Well, somebody should’ve gotten pissed off when they saw all that...
    Me   : Key word "should’ve".
    Brown: Right. 
           Anyway, May 25th, 2020.
           About 2 hours before the incident at Zappone.
    Me   : Alright, so, that whole day my BATTERY WAS DRAINING A LOT FASTER THAN NORMAL. 
           Typically I could get several hours of continuous video, but I knew that someone was ACTIVELY BROADCASTING
           THE CONTENT OF MY DEVICE, and had been doing so since I went to S.A.N.G., on May 22nd, 2020.
    Brown: That incident with Rotterdam calling us?
    Me   : Yeah, Scott Schelling SCSO-2020-027797, he performed a welfare check after I went to Stratton to state that 
           someone was using a device that sounds a lot like a bird, behind the building across the street from Snyders.
    Brown: Bro, I could totally kill a mockingbird... 
           ...with the way you’re tellin’ me this story...
    Me   : Yeah. 
           Look. 
           I’m just going to come right out and say it, I think the Central Intelligence Agency has drones that 
           look and sound like actual real-life birds.
    Brown: You do understand how that SOUNDS psychotic... 
           ...right?
    Me   : If something SOUNDS crazy, but it’s ACCURATE...? 
           Then, that means it’s not crazy at all. 
           YOU are.
    Brown: Duly noted.
    Me   : Yeah, but the reason why I think that is because of the multiple recordings of this ‘device’, 
           which I attempted to share with the soldiers at Stratton Air National Guard.
    Brown: So, even if the CIA did send something like that, why would they send one after YOU...?
    Me   : I don’t really know, isn’t that YOUR job...? 
           To like, determine the probability and likelihood of something no matter how far fetched or 
           difficult to believe it is...?
    Brown: Yeah. 
           Within reason. 
           If somebody says dragons are flyin’ all over the place, I’m not gonna just IMMEDIATELY drop what I’m doing, 
           grab my binoculars, and look out the window...
    Me   : Alright, so...
           ...this thing can be heard in the MULTIPLE audio recordings I’ve got...
    Brown: Alright, maybe if I’m bored enough, I’ll check out the recordings AGAIN, later. 
           Get back to May 25th, 2020.
    Me   : So, I had a feeling that there was a party of people that had been following me since I left Stratton, 
           if not before that.
    Brown: Got it. 
           Who...?
    Me   : Honestly, I can’t say with certainty. 
           I think the [RUSSIANS] were watching me when I worked at [COMPUTER ANSWERS], 
           since the owner is from [RUSSIA/UKRAINE], 
           and so is his [FATHER] who owns [SOFT N’ CUSHY AUTO UPHOLSTRY] in [SCHENECTADY].
    Brown: Alright, so let’s invest SOME (probability/likelihood) into [RUSSIANS] possibly having an INTEREST 
           in you...
    Me   : Wow. 
           Holy shit... 
           I’ve been waiting like, decades for a police officer to say that...~!
    Brown: Yeah, I got ya... 
           Holy hell.
           Sorry we didn’t get the memo.
    Me   : PAVEL ZAICHENKO JR. wasn’t always a bad dude to work for. 
           He just had some INSANE JEALOUSY issues, when it came to ME being the LEADER of the COMPANY.
    Brown: Whoa, what do you mean, LEADER...?
    Me   : Well, I was the [MOST PROFITABLE EMPLOYEE IN THE COMPANY] within my [FIRST 6 MONTHS], 
           DWAYNE COONRADT and I, MICHAEL C. FUCKIN’ COOK, threw down the gauntlet, back-to-back, 
           balls-to-the-wall, you-see-what-you-get, and you-get-what-you-see...
           this man and I literally cleaned house, and destroyed every sales record EVER set there.
           Whereby setting 3 consecutive months in a row, of sustained 30K+ in sales for those months. 
           That had never been done before in the history of the company.
    Brown: That’s, amazing with the way you just described it.
           But- why would PAVEL ZAICHENKO JR. be jealous of that...?
    Me   : He could’ve done that 1 time during the 15-20 years he owned the company, but- didn’t.
           Just, WAY too busy collecting lock boxes...
    Brown: Nothin’ wrong with that, dude.
    Me   : Not at all. But, an ACTUAL EXPERT who owns a COMPANY, wouldn’t try to take CREDIT for something that 
           they didn’t actually DO. Everybody may have a different approach, but SOMEONE has to show the OWNER 
           of the company, HOW TO RUN IT... if it’s not running PROFITABLY.
           The company WAS running profitably, but if you looked at the company REVENUE STREAM on a STORE-BY-STORE
           basis... many stores were like, barely holding on by a thread, and more often than not, LOSING MONEY.
           I mean, he tells people he practically single-handedly built COMPUTER ANSWERS, by himself... with no help. 
           Just, him, and years of being the only guy to build his company.
    Brown: Heh, I mean, that’s *hands outstretched* total bullshit, though.
    Me   : Right. 
           Dude doesn’t even know how to replace a motherboard in a laptop...
    Brown: I don’t know what that is... 
           But, it’s whatever. 
           Basically what you’re saying is that the owner was JEALOUS that you had better COMPUTER ANSWERS...
           ...than him...?
    Me   : EXACTLY, that’s right - JEALOUSY being the MOTIVATING FACTOR.
           The principle being, the OWNER of a business named COMPUTER ANSWERS, would just look like a fuckin’
           TOOL, if he didn’t have the BEST answers for anything COMPUTER related.
           It was a common thing, actually.
           DWAYNE COONRADT and I would joke about it all the time...
    Brown: Sounds like you had some rapport with this DWAYNE guy...
    Me   : Yeah, he wasn’t ALWAYS a bad dude, he has a SERIOUS ISSUE WITH MORALITY.
           He just puts himself FIRST, and if there’s anything left after that...?
           Then, that’s how much he cares about others.
           Know what I’m sayin’...?
    Brown: I mean, that’s life, pal...
    Me   : Yeh, STEALING THINGS from CUSTOMERS and SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTORS is NOT a good way to perform business.
           Neither is LYING to those CUSTOMERS or SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTORS, because THEY will actually FIND OUT if...
           ...you’re fuckin’ LYING to them.
    Brown: Alright.
    Me   : Also, the OWNER committing LABOR FRAUD and being INVESTIGATED by the LABOR DEPARTMENT in AUGUST 2017, 
           caused me to have LESS TRUST in the GUY that didn’t really DO A WHOLE LOT other than COLLECT the 
           content of the LOCK BOXES every 2 WEEKS.
    Brown: That’s his choice though. 
           If he’s payin’ you guys, and training you, then who are you to judge what he does...?
    Me   : I mean, that’s just the thing. 
           HE doesn’t train ANYBODY. 
           DWAYNE does that.
           PAVEL, would ALMOST pay people.
           NEITHER of them trained ME at ALL...
           I was FORMALLY TRAINED before I EVER worked at NFRASTRUCTURE in 2010.
           THEN I started working for COMPUTER ANSWERS in OCTOBER 2015.
           THEY didn’t TRAIN ME AT ALL.
           I had an EXPERT named DAVID PATZARIAN who was my TEACHER in 2001-2003.
           He taught me basically “how to be an expert”, when I was still in HIGH SCHOOL.
    Brown: What do you mean PAVEL ALMOST paid people...?
    Me   : Well, the dude would ALMOST pay me (and everybody else), what the COMPANY OWED ME for my WORKED HOURS. 
           And by ALMOST, what I mean is like 60% under the table, and 40% on the books. (← ALWAYS, MORE OR LESS)
           Sometimes the 60% under the table would be like, a COOL `$10 bucks.
    Brown: For how many hours of work...? 
    Me   : Idk, anywhere between 50 to 120 hours a week I used to work.
    Brown: ...and the 60% he owed ya, would amount to `$10 bucks...?
    Me   : Yeh.
    Brown: Doesn’t make any sense...
    Me   : Right.
           It doesn’t make any sense at all, does it...?
    Brown: If you were working 100 some odd hours a week, how would he only have like `$10 bucks to pay you...?
    Me   : It’s a perfectly legitimate question, dude.
           I really think this dude is just really bad at math.
    Brown: I find that REALLY hard to believe.
    Me   : Ok, fine. 
           It wasn’t ALWAYS like that.
           ...but that is just about what I was taking home when I used to work the Asurion contract. 
           He accumulated about `$4K of wages of money he wasn’t able to pay me.
    Brown: Alright, so, there might be enough to go on there, to take a closer look at this dude. 
           Something doesn’t sound right about what you just said.
    Me   : Nah. 
           Which is why I wound up leaving the company in October 2018.
    Brown: Good. 
           Now, May 25th, 2020. 
           How does all of this tie in with that night...?
    Me   : Alright, so, ever since January 15th, 2019 when a HACKER used an EXTREMELY SOPHISTICATED ATTACK VECTOR,
           compared to ALL OTHER ISSUES I had EVER HANDLED THERE,
           I had been keeping my eyes peeled for potential sabotage from the owner of COMPUTER ANSWERS. 
           Seemed like a possibility, that this dude was doing a LOT MORE than just being fuckin’ terrible at math.
           Seemed like maybe he might be ATTACKING MY WORK, and perhaps had done so in a few instances in the past.
    Brown: Ok...? 
           So, is that why you kept going around the shop?
    Me   : Yeah.
    Brown: There may be SOME CORRELATION here between RUSSIA, and you working at COMPUTER ANSWERS, 
           especially if you were doing the level of work you say you were doing...
    Me   : When I say I "ran" COMPUTER ANSWERS for about 3 years, what I mean is that I LITERALLY went to 
           each individual store, upgraded that stores’ entire network, the server, the routers, the switches, 
           networking cables, RAID storage tanks...
           Like I’m not exaggerating when I say, I looked for ANY POSSIBLE WAY, to do my job FASTER.
           ...because when I (modified/upgraded) the equipment, I could turn a profit a LOT FASTER than the 
           OTHER employees at OTHER stores, who just felt like bitching and complaining about how there was
           nothing to do. There was plenty for them to do. They didn’t FEEL like they HAD to do any of it.
           And, that’s because the OWNER didn’t TEACH THEM, how to FIND things to do.
    Brown: So... you IMPROVED all of the EQUIPMENT at EACH STORE to DO YOUR JOB FASTER...?
    Me   : *snaps fingers and thumb, then points index finger* Exactly.
           Nobody else in the company ever thought to do that.
           I was highly skilled at that. 
           I even did this same thing back in 2010-2011 when I worked at NFRASTRUCTURE at 5 Enterprise Ave., 
           then Mr. Pickett FIRED ME FOR IT. Though, he wasn’t the one who fired me. I know that MATT CALDWELL
           had asked KRISTEN STANGLE to do that FOR him... which is why I wrote a SKIT, about HER.
    Brown: Yeah, I read the skit.
    Me   : Look. I’m so efficient with my work, that I often have nothing to do because I found a smarter way
           to do my job... 
           ...and this pisses guys like MATT CALDWELL, DWAYNE COONRADT, and PAVEL ZAICHENKO off... 
           ...cause, how the hell could some DIPSHIT LIKE ME...
           ...CONSISTENTLY OUTPERFORM OTHER PEOPLE, with all of their years of experience...?
           Well, it’s because I’m a GENIUS.
    Brown: Well, nobody’s saying you’re not TALENTED...
    Me   : Nah, they definitely are, dude.
           When push came to shove, PAVEL didn’t like being told to "shut the fuck up and let me do your job".
    Brown: I can’t imagine anybody would be okay with hearing that...
    Me   : Nah, I know that.
           It became a viable strategy at some point, because of how many times he lied to my face.
           Lies that NORMAL PEOPLE/EMPLOYEES never suspect.
           This dude straight up called Arlene Woodruff at FLEET FEET, AFTER I did a job in the Wolf Road location.
           I had a feeling that PAVEL had called her.
           So I asked him about it, and he was being QUITE A PUSSY and EVASIVE about it.
           That’s when I realized, this dude must think I’m not a lot smarter than he is, because...
           ...I would have to be one of the dumbest fuckin’ people that have ever lived, to NOT suspect he would 
           do EXACTLY what he lied about doing.
           If he knew any better, he would’ve let me take control of his company.
           He knew he would make more money, since I set a number of sales records there at the stores, AND 
           doing on site and business consultations.
           He isn’t making anywhere close to the money he made when I worked there.
           That’s because he doesn’t know what the hell he’s doing.
           He will call a client like Tim Gardner and say: 
           Pavel : Tim, I don’t have Mike, anymore. 
                   But- I’ll hire a NEW guy that knows VMWare BETTER than Mike.
                   The NEW guy will know VMWare inside and out.
                   He’ll be like 10 fuckin’ Mikes, dude.
           But then, he can’t actually pull that off.
           Talks quite an amazing game, fails miserably.
           That’s really how PATHETIC Pavel Zaichenko is.
    Brown: Well, maybe you shouldn’t try to strong-arm the business owner, making them feel like they’re not 
           really involved in the business...
    Me   : Alright, so assume that your SUPERIOR, MICHAEL ZURLO, literally paid himself every week, 
           to go into the office, and just kick his feet up on his desk, and literally stare at the fuckin’ 
           wall for 50-60 hours a week.
           And then, pay himself 3x the amount of money that YOU get paid.
    Brown: He doesn’t do that.
    Me   : How do you know...?
    Brown: ... (<- I’ll let someone from SCSO fill that part out)
    Me   : Regardless, how can ANYONE at ANY BUSINESS/AGENCY PROVE that the DIRECTOR/PERSON IN CHARGE, 
           isn’t just SPYING on their COMPETITION...?
    Brown: That’s real tough, buddy.
           They probably ALL do it.
    Me   : Nah, not ALL of them do that.
           But, I know for a fact that NFRASTRUCTURE most certainly DOES do that.
           As for PAVEL ZAICHENKO JR., it is LITERALLY the FULLEST EXTENT of what the dude was doing. 
           Me and Dwayne, busting our asses, generating tons of profit.
           The other guys, sitting around, complaining, not doing enough work to pull their own weight. 
           Constantly. 
           Every day. 
           Dudes having an axe to grind, cause I’d tell em
           "Listen fuckface, maybe you should turn a profit sometime..." 
           Of course, nobody likes to be told that they’re incompetent.
    Brown: Yeah. Nobody does...
    Me   : Look, how long have you been a police officer....?
    Brown: Decades buddy. 
    Me   : Alright, so... 
           ...imagine I come along and say "You don’t know what the hell you’re doing..."
    Brown: I’d tell you that you obviously don’t know who the fuck you’re talkin’ to...
    Me   : Exactly. 
           That’s how MANY of my interactions with the guys at COMPUTER ANSWERS, were.
    Brown: I could see how that would frustrate you.
    Me   : Yeah, and then the owner did an amazing job of pretending like he was my BUDDY.
           For like 1 day every 2 weeks, he would be my BEST FRIEND in the WORLD, for like a few hours... 
           ...after strong-arming ALL of the employees into coming to these kick-ass store meetings that 
           lasted several hours. 
           Just to get my paycheck.
    Brown: You know they can’t legally do that if you don’t want to go... 
           ...right?
    Me   : Oh, maybe...? 
           But, this is a fuckin’ immigrant from [RUSSIA/UKRAINE] PAVEL ZAICHENKO JR. you’re talkin’ about... 
           Dude has FIST-FOUGHT his fair share of POLAR BEARS in his day, up in SIBERIA.
    Brown: *sneers* Nobody FIST FIGHTS polar bears bro... 
           C’mon now...
    Me   : This dude PRACTICALLY tells people he does with his fuckin’ eyebrows, dude. 
           So many times, I’ve practically SEEN him do it...
           Pavel : Oh, is that a polar bear growling at me...?
                   Guess the fuckin’ polar bear thinks he’s tough shit, huh...? *whpsh*
                   *punches the polar bear in the nose...*
                   *polar bear starts whining and runs away*
                   Yeah. 
                   You better fuckin’ run...
    Brown: Bullshit. 
           *crosses arms* I don’t believe it.
    Me   : Oh, believe it bro. 
           Dude had a routine.
           1) pound an entire gallon of vodka that his buddies JUST whipped up
           2) jump into a river that’s ALMOST FROZEN, but it’s still mostly liquid
           3) swim around for a while as he talks all sorts of shit in half-English, half-Russian... 
           4) the moment he even SEES a polar bear nearby...?
           5) climb out for a minute
           6) kick the shit out of that polar bear
           7) jump back into the river
           8) talk shit about the polar bear he just kicked the shit out of AND anybody else
           9) not freeze to death or anything like that, nor get hypothermia
           10) climb out of the cold-ass river...
           11) continue talking shit about everybody
           12) collect lock boxes every 2 weeks.
    Brown: That’s straight up bullshit. 
           None of that has ever happened.
    Me   : Nah, some of that HAS happened.
           Sorta makes you ask yourself some questions, doesn’t it...?
    Brown: Nah, I just said that shit is impossible.
    Me   : *scoffs* That’s what I thought, too. 
           Then this dude laid out his master plan at the latest company meeting, 
           and dazzled everybody with this tale about his days as a mixed martial artist...
    Brown: Yeah...? 
           That’s not even close to swimming in a frozen river after drinking a lethal amount of vodka, 
           and fist fighting polar bears. 
           I believe that he could’ve been saying shit in half-English, half-Russian... 
           but the rest of that story is bullshit.
    Me   : Yeah, well... 
           ...you live and learn, I guess.
           That’s what I thought too... 
           Anyway, that’s how Pavel announces himself.
           "Hey I’m the best there is at everything...? Now, fuck you." -Pavel
    Brown: So, all of that was a hyperbole...?
    Me   : Yeh. 
           Obviously, but the way HE makes himself sound...? 
           It’s as if he could fist fight polar bears, one right after another. 
    Brown: Well, maybe HE should stick to sales...
    Me   : Yeah, I thought that too. 
           Cause he seems to do a somewhat okay job for somebody who’s owned a computer repair business 
           for like nearly 2 decades.
    Brown: So, what you’re telling me is that this dude is an egotistical Russian that basically took credit 
           for the work you were doing...?
    Me   : *snaps fingers and thumb, points* Exactly.
    Brown: ...that is pretty messed up, actually...
    Me   : Exactly.
    Brown: Why did you stay as long as you did...?
    Me   : Because I was SO talented at the job, that I could LITERALLY walk into one of the stores when 
           I wasn’t working, and RANDOMLY talk a customer into spending like `$(500..1000) on store merchandise.
           Ask Tim Gardner.
           Any time I was standing in a store, and Tim happened to show up...?
           He would be impressed by the WAY I talked about stuff... he’d already have his credit card ready to go.
           The man literally heard me talk about Threadripper, and turning the 11 computers he had in his office...
           ...into a SINGLE machine, with the Threadripper TR4v1 platform.
           X399 Gaming Pro Carbon.
           Threadripper 1950X
           64GB DDR4
           4TB SSD (backup)
           1TB SSD NVMe drive (main)
           3x GTX 1060 (3GB VRAM) running 7x monitors at 1080p
           Dude swiped his credit card with the WAY I described a CONCEPT that I had, in... August 2017.
           `$6500 for a desktop that we didn’t even have.
    Brown: Wow. 
           That’s not bad.
    Me   : I know. I could still do that, right now too.
           But- that particular machine and what it could do, caused me to want to understand: 
           APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT, and combine it with VIRTUALIZATION, HARDWARE, and NETWORKING
    Brown: So, the owner of the company felt like you were better at running his company... 
           ...than him...?
    Me   : Exactly.
    Brown: I mean, it doesn’t make any sense that he would try to kick you out of it though...
    Me   : RUSSIANS don’t make a lot of fucking sense sometimes, buddy.
           Look at BRUCE TANSKI.
    Brown: Hey... 
           ...don’t go stereotyping all RUSSIANS now...
    Me   : Nah. 
           Fuck that. 
           Sometimes RUSSIANS are primarily responsible, for making very ignorant choices.
           BUT- sometimes that’s ALSO because of the BRITISH.
           At some point the BRITISH and the RUSSIANS joined forces.       
           BRITISH  : OK BUDDY, YOU DO THIS...? 
                      AND, I’LL DO THAT. 
                      GOT ME...?
           RUSSIANS : YEAH I GOT YOU, HOME SLICE.
           BRITISH  : THESE FUCKIN’ AMERICANS ARE SOOOO FUCKING STUPID, THEY’LL NEVER EVER KNOW.
           RUSSIANS : ESPECIALLY IF WE TALK IN HALF-ENGLISH, HALF-RUSSIAN.
           BRITISH  : THAT’S RIGHT. абсолютная власть требует абсолютной коррупции
           RUSSIANS : абсолютная власть требует абсолютной коррупции
           That’s about the most honest thing I can say to you. 
           I actually don’t think they can help it...
    Brown: I don’t understand what those two lines mean...
    Me   : Absolute power requires absolute corruption.
           Basically, if you lie to EVERYBODY ALL THE TIME...?
           ...like THEY do...?
           Then you’ll eventually attain ABSOLUTE POWER.
           But, the farther apart you can spread your ass cheeks, the faster you’ll get to the top.
           It’s more than just lifestyle... it’s their way of life.
    Brown: Wow.
           So maybe they just can’t HELP lunging at you, and punching you in the face on ‘accident’...
           ...after running your mouth like that...?
           ...cause they do that too...?
    Me   : Exactly.
           I have come to expect that, so there’s no way in hell they would actually land a punch.
    Brown: Ah. 
           So you’re one of those "able to predict people" types of guys, eh?
    Me   : Exactly. 
           I can tell when a business owner would rather collect lock boxes than to do any of the work I did 
           to make the stores more profitable, I can tell when a doctor has a dildo in his asshole when he tries 
           to diagnose somebody with a condition in 4 minutes flat, I can tell when a lawyer is making up excuses 
           for how busy they say they are, when in reality, they just say all that to sound more important... 
           I even know when a police officer talks to me in a dubious manner that allows me to understand when 
           they’re lying to my fucking face.
    Brown: So, you have psychology down eh?
    Me   : Right. (Chapter: PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION)
    Brown: I can understand how you cause people to get upset with themselves then.
    Me   : Sometimes. 
           If someone keeps pretending like I’m just some ugly looking motherfucker that stands around 
           doing everybody’s work only to be paid a fraction of what I brought in...? 
           I have to start using terms like "Hm... whose legs, need to be kicked out from underneath them...?"
    Brown: So, people treat you like a pushover...?
    Me   : Precisely, then when I start using language like... 
           "HEY NUMBNUTS~! How would you like to get knocked the fuck out...? yea or nay?" 
           Then sometimes people will stop treating me like a pushover...
           ...OTHER times, I might catch ERIC CATRICALA TRYING TO MURDER ME.
    Brown: Yeah, but... you push people TOO FAR, and they’re going to feel like YOU’RE the bully...
    Me   : Ah.
           Me doing most of the work for everybody, so that everybody else can get their ENTIRE paycheck... 
           ...meanwhile I don’t get the thousands of dollars I’m owed...? 
           Nah. 
           That’s not bullying anybody. 
           That’s basically me considering clever ways to implicitly tell people that my short fuse is
           getting a lot shorter...
    Brown: Can’t talk to everybody like that though.
    Me   : Yeah, well, literally every person on earth, every company in the (economy/finance) world... 
           ...they all lie about something.
           I’m not gonna bitch or complain about how everybody lies.
           But when it becomes a pattern, and reveals something darker or sinister underneath, 
           I’m gonna keep making indications, and if it continues, get more and more descriptive about it.
    Brown: Alright, huge tangent. 
           Bring this back to May 25th, 2020.
    Me   : So, I was walking around making audio recordings. 
           My hand was busted. 
           I made a lot of recordings and took some pictures. 
           Somebody was blocking some of my pictures from making it to Google Drive too. (My cousin RYAN WARD)
    Brown: Alright...?
    Me   : Anyway, I took some pictures, posted something on Facebook about 7 Northside Drive, a window there 
           had a light on all the time, for like, months... seemed super suspicious because no cars had been 
           parked near this place for a while.
           Anyway, I spoke about CAPITAL DIGITRONICS, cause they specialize in radio communications for the 
           New York State Police... and like magic...? 
           Apparently my NEIGHBORS nor the POLICE had any clue... 
           ...what CAPITAL DIGITRONICS even IS...
    Brown: They provide radio equipment for the NEW YORK STATE POLICE, IN THIS AREA.
           They have a TOWER on WILLARD MOUNTAIN.
           You think your smartphone had a secretly enabled RADIO BROADCAST/STREAM...?
    Me   : Yep. 
           Not sure HOW...? 
           But I would imagine, that the FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, 
           the NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY,
           and the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, they can enable the internet for a given device.
           THEY can check up on a PARTICULAR SUBJECT, even though the SUBJECT may not have a CONNECTION TO THE INTERNET.
    Brown: A lot of ADVANCED THEORIES you seem to have...
    Me   : Well, I AM AN EXPERT JUST SO YA KNOW.
           One day I saw the exploit in “Microsoft Word”, when I had no access to the internet.
           Basically, they can see IN, even if I can’t see OUT.
           I remember MICHAEL BAKER from DILIGENCE, LLC. (former CIA) talking with JOE ROGAN about DEEP FAKES.
           These DEEP FAKE videos use ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE to basically SKULL-FUCK people, into thinking
           that the video features the REAL-LIFE VERSION of a particular person.
           When the AI gets a lot better at doing this...? 
           It’s gonna cause some fuckin’ problems, alright.
           So, I began to theorize on advanced, top-shelf, high-tech, ahead-of-its-time, classified tools that the
           Central Intelligence Agency would (CONCEPTUALIZE/BUILD), and then I made some AUDIO RECORDINGS between 
           MAY 19th-21st 2020...
           ...some of my THEORIES started becoming a REALITY...
           ...like BIRDS THAT DONT SOUND LIKE REAL BIRDS.
           Like, DEEP FAKES applied to BIRDS.
           Not talking about the campaign BIRDS AREN’T REAL, because that dude says all birds have been 
           literally replaced by drones. I’m not saying that at all.
           I’m saying, it seems like a pretty advanced idea, to use a bird as a surveillance drone.
           AND, if a HUMAN hasn’t invented it, then what I recorded isn’t human made, nor is it natural.
           Imagine if S.A.N.G. had a fuckin’ clue, ya know...?
    Brown: Yeah, maybe someone high up or cool AF was keeping tabs on you, so what...?
    Me   : Well, somebody heard me talking some major shit about GEORGE W. BUSH, 
           ...and JAMES COMEY. And, HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON. 
           And, ANDREW "Don’t touch me, grandpa" CUOMO. 
           And Mr. (DANIEL/JESSE/JOHN* PICKETT). 
           And PAVEL ZAICHENKO JR. 
           And whoever else...
    Brown: I mean, when you say you were talking shit about some of these people... 
           ...what sorta of stuff were you talking about...?
    Me   : I’m talkin’ like, ANDREW CUOMO could SWALLOW an ENTIRE 15-inch kielbasa by himself (without gagging), 
           from what I have been told, JUST LIKE THE WOMAN IN THE MOVIE, HOWARD STERN: PRIVATE PARTS. 
           JAMES COMEY may have eaten a LOT OF LEADED PAINT CHIPS, because he LIED to the AMERICAN PEOPLE about 
           HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON’s criminal investigation back in July 2016. 
           Then, GEORGE W. BUSH had this awesome celebration on a Nimitz-class (nuclear powered) battleship, 
           saying MISSION ACCOMPLISHED (my dudes) back on May 1st, 2003. 
           Dude wasn’t even REMOTELY CLOSE to ACCOMPLISHING the MISSION though... 
           Like, wtf buddy? 
           Fool me once, shame on... shame on you? Ya fooled me, but can’t get fooled again... 
           Then, MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. 
           Felt like this dude was able to FOOL EVERYBODY AGAIN...
           I also said something about BARACK OBAMA, because I’m still fuckin’ heated that he labeled EDWARD SNOWDEN
           as a SPY/TRAITOR. Even though he is still my "favorite" president, it really causes a CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
    Brown: Sounds like you know some of your politics and shit...
    Me   : That’s probably the first time a police officer has said those words. 
           Rather than "You sound like you’re psychotic or somethin’ man..." 
           or, "James Comey would never lie to the American people... Not once..."
           Sure he wouldn’t.
           Here’s the press conference he had of him basically proving that his department is worthless.
           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghph_361wa0 
           When I say worthless...?
           I mean that they did their job.
           But, the (government/DOJ) can fuckin’ literally tell people that CRIMES ARE BEING COMMITTED,
           and then OH MAN SOMEBODY WAS LIKE OOOAOooOOOhhHHH. Can’t see us prosecuting this woman.
           BUT THEN- 2 kids get charged with MURDER in the FIRST DEGREE in PHILADELPHIA when the POLICE 
           accidentally SHOT some 8-year-old girl, and died.
           Ah. That’s what I mean by FUCKING WORTHLESS.
           I don’t think people get it.
           They’re gonna feel insulted by what I said, but they’re not the problem.
    Brown: Nah, that dude straight up lied in a press conference about the Clinton investigation,
           right before the 2016 election...
    Me   : Exactly. 
           Maybe it’s ok if SHE commits crimes... 
           Cause, she’s fuckin’ HILLARY RODHAM "Who gives a shit?" CLINTON... 
           It’s part of her name, "who gives a shit?". 
           Well, it’s a rhetorical question.
           You don’t earn yourself a middle name like "Who gives a shit?"...
           ...if nobody has enough time to ANSWER THAT QUESTION...
           It’s like:
           Person1 : HILLARY RODHAM "Who gives a shit?"-
           Person2 : J-
           Person1 : -CLINTON.
           A lot of people are trying to answer the god damn question...
           But there’s not enough time in the time-space continuum, OR existence itself, 
           to answer the god damn question.
           It’s not part of her name cause people aren’t trying to answer that question...
           It’s part of her name because it’s a rhetorical question.
    Brown: I... 
           ...gave a shit about that whole ordeal...
    Me   : I’m sure a LOT of people do, but your input, and my input, it’s never considered.
           These people can LITERALLY piss all over the Constitution, and the American flag.
           But, any citizen who tries to do that TOO, will be told "THATS NOT PATRIOTIC, YA FUCKIN’ DOUCHBAG~!"
           And, if they do this in front of the SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE, they’re gettin’ hauled off to jail.
           So, the term ‘American Democracy’ is just a meaningless phrase that carries no weight.
           Now, imagine if JAMES COMEY’s job, was to IGNORE ALL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS into ANYBODY in the 
           GOVERNMENT. So like, a FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, or whatever.
    Brown: Ehhh... 
           ...that’s why I don’t like to talk politics dude. 
           Is it fair that some FBI or CIA dude could kill an American citizen with advanced CIA tools...? 
           Well, no. 
           It isn’t fair at all... 
           ...so, what can anybody do about it...?
    Me   : Exactly.
           Life isn’t fair at all.
           If somebody wants to use cheat codes...?
           Let em.
           Nobody who ever beat the game WITHOUT CHEATING, ever remember how COOL the game was...
           ...when they played by the DEFAULT rules.
           Ya know...?
           Maybe the DEFAULT rules DON’T APPLY to (CERTAIN PEOPLE/ROYALTY),
           but they sure as hell apply to EVERYBODY ELSE.
    Brown: That’s... 
           ...been my thought process for a while.
    Me   : Maybe it’s OK if the people in control of the government... 
           ...waste a lot of taxpayers money, like, SYSTEMATICALLY.
           Everybody worked their asses off paying their taxes, but then `$1T worth of vehicles, ammunition, 
           helicopters, bombs, missiles, weapons, artillery, gear, clothing, combat fatigues... all of it 
           was left behind in Afghanistan.
           Any day now, there could be an INVASION in THE UNITED STATES, where people with LEGITIMATE U.S. 
           MADE EQUIPMENT, LOOKING IDENTICAL to ACTUAL U.S. SOLDIERS... right...?
           But- it’s the TALIBAN.
           Comin’ to kill a bunch of us.
           It’d be like the American Colonists taking the clothes and stuff off of the BRITISH ARMY during 
           the REVOLUTIONARY WAR, and then SETTING SAIL to BRITAIN, and then BEING ABLE TO WALK RIGHT UP TO 
           THE QUEEN. UH-OH...~!
           Hm. 
           Everybody paid their taxes that WHOLE TIME, and then FREELY DONATED ALL THAT SHIT, to OUR ENEMY.
           Sounds like something a MORON would do, like DONALD TRUMP.
           Then, when the taxpayers get pissed off, and say stuff like "You’re wasting everybody’s fucking money..."
           MARK ZUCKERBERG can CENSOR someone saying something like that on FACEBOOK like he DOES to ME.
           Then, the government can just SILENTLY KILL that person, and then PRETEND it was just some sick 
           twisted "accident" where somebody SUPPOSEDLY dialed 911.
    Brown: Yeah man. 
           Could happen to anybody... 
           They’re not all evil pricks though.
    Me   : I know that.
           They can’t ALL be evil pricks cause if they were...? 
           ...anybody could get silently killed for even LOOKING AT SOMEBODY the wrong way. 
           Person1 : What the hell did I EVER do to you...?
           Killer  : Uh, well... you looked at me the wrong way.
           Person1 : ...that’s it...?
           Killer  : Yeah.
                     I don’t like when people even ALMOST look at me the wrong way.
                     You flat out TOTALLY looked at me the wrong way.
                     Now you’re REAL fucked, dude.
           Person1 : I mean, I’m sorry...
                     I won’t do it again...
           Killer  : You’re right, you WON’T do it again.
                     *shakes head* Look at what you have FORCED me to have to do.
                     Gotta kill ya now.
           Person1 : Wow, this sure as hell isn’t FAIR.
           Killer  : Oh well.
           Probably sounds funny, but that shit probably happens.
           Or like, writing all their lowercase I’s without the little dot...
    Brown: Oh god. 
           *holds hands to face* Lowercase I’s without the dots...?
    Me   : Yep.
           Maybe that’s the type of stuff that could set them off...
           Them : OMG. 
                  THIS FUCKIN PRICK ISN’T USING THE DOTS IN HIS LOWERCASE I’S...~!
                  ASSHOLE...~!
                  TIME FOR HIM TO DIE...~!
           I am exaggerating that, but at the same time *squints* am I really...?
    Brown: They wouldn’t do something so evil for such a ridiculous reason, buddy...
    Me   : Yeah...? 
           You really think so...?
    Brown: Yeah. 
           They’re not gonna care if the dots are there, or not.
    Me   : *scoffs* Says YOU... 
           How do you know...?
           They might actually feel extremely offended by the missing dots.
           Because, in BRITAIN, it is CUSTOM, TRADITION, and has gone back for CENTURIES,
           this MISSING DOT in the LOWERCASE I’S could be equivalent to declaring an act of war.
           Now you’re DOUBLE fucked, dude.
    Brown: The *way* in which a lowercase I is written, isn’t going to cause someone to lash out at you,
           or anybody else...
    Me   : I mean... 
           ...you say that, but here we are, having this conversation...
    Brown: Yeah. 
           So, May 25th, 2020 - 7 Northside Drive, continue.
    Me   : Anyway, I saw 2-3 SCSO cars drive down 146 toward Fire Road, and then turn in toward the fire station. 
           I had a firm suspicion that they might’ve had a radio feed to my device... 
           ...so I didn’t put a whole lot of thought toward whether that was TRUE or not.
           I just made observations that led me to deduce that things I saw happening in real life...?
           Could, in fact, be explained by the thing I suspected.
           Some sort of FEED being ENABLED on my DEVICE since TIM COOK was COOL ENOUGH...
           ...to leave that option THERE, since he’s the CEO of APPLE, who MANUFACTURED my DEVICE.
           Which means I’d have an actual LAWSUIT TO FILE against a `$3T COMPANY.
           One that could BANKRUPT THAT `$3T COMPANY.
           "LARGEST LAWSUIT IN HISTORY"
    Brown: Well, sounds like you might have schizophrenia or something. 
           Cause, IDK, that’s what my SCSO field manual tells me to suggest.
           I have no idea if that’s true or not...
           ...it’s just what MICHAEL ZURLO told us to (say/do).
    Me   : Nah, it’s not true. 
           You know what IS true...?
           TIM COOK, is gay.
           APPLE is worth `$3T.
           They have been SENDING zero-day exploits they FIND, to NSO GROUP in ISRAEL.
           They make MONEY ALL DAY LONG, by KILLING UNSUSPECTING CIVILIANS.
           That is how they became a company worth `$3T.
    Brown: *nervous, gulp* I have an iPhone...
    Me   : Might wanna consider smashing it with a baseball bat.
           Cause it’s a TROJAN HORSE.
    Brown: The problem is, how can I convince people that might not be very intelligent... 
           ...that I was doing all of that stuff for a WHOLE WEEK, because SOMEBODY kept REMOTELY INTERACTING...
           ...with my smartphone...?
           I mean, I could even LITERALLY MAKE A GOD DAMN VIDEO WITH MY CHILDREN...
           https://youtu.be/HT4p28bRhqc 
           ...and LAURA HUGHES from CPS, or KRISTIN JOHNSON, can have NO FUCKIN’ CLUE THAT VIDEO EXISTS.
           Then, a guy in a blue truck who kept TRACKING ME WITH THE GPS SIGNAL ON MY DEVICE...
           ...showed up a dozen times on Cemetery Road, stared at me for like a minute, and then took off...
           Well, it’s because I’m literally surrounded by an ENTIRE TOWN full of OBLIVIOUS PEOPLE.
           Just like my mother.
           Experienced BRAIN DAMAGE from LEAD POISONING from the LEADED GASOLINE that they USED 
           TO FILL THEIR VEHICLES and drive around between 50s-80s.... then DROVE AROUND.
           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV3dnLzthDA 
    Brown: I’m going to ask you more questions about this blue truck. 
           I think that’s incredibly suspicious, and if you’re telling me that it was following 
           Deputy Anthony Agresta on Sitterly Road on May 19th, 2020...? 
           Then, by god... 
           Maybe someone in the police department WAS being followed...
    Me   : ...right. 
           I mean, how would the police even know that they’re being stalked, tracked, or watched...?
    Brown: It’s a good question... 
           It’s not like any of them would really care or not...
    Me   : Right. 
           Maybe some of them SHOULD care, but they don’t. 
           Sorta like Trooper Carter. 
           Dude looks me dead-eyed in the face and says 
           Carter : Yeah, anybody could be tracking me with the scanner, so what pal...?
           CAPITAL DIGITRONICS PROVIDES HIS RADIO EQUIPMENT.
           OH WOW.
           That’s just how oblivious EVERYONE IN MY TOWN IS.
           I can tell them the TRUTH, REPEATEDLY, OVER AND OVER, and they will be too oblivious...
           ...to understand what the fuck I’m saying.
           Consistently, too.
           Now, I know which people AREN’T OBLIVIOUS AT ALL.
           They’re worth a lot of money.
    Brown: He’s right. 
           Anybody COULD be.
    Me   : Yeah.
           Somebody who deployed CAPITAL DIGITRONICS EQUIPMENT, knows how to JOIN the PRIVATE and PUBLIC CHANNELS.
           Cool, huh...?
           There are PEOPLE that live DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM ME, who WORK for CAPITAL DIGITRONICS.
           So like, take for instance, DAYS before I met Trooper Carter...
           ...the RUSSIANS overrode the SECURITY of the: 
           - Department of Defense
           - Department of Commerce
           - Department of Energy
           - committed the 2020 Federal Data Breach
           - SOLORIGATE
           ...and then a lot of highly respected people that get paid a lot of money...
           ...they all realized that I HAD A FUCKING CLUE, 6 FULL ENTIRE MONTHS BEFORE THAT.
           They fucked up REALLY BADLY... 
           And TROOPER CARTER had SOME NERVE to TELL ME:
           Carter : Oh well bro. 
                    Shit happens. 
                    Whaddya gonna do...?
                    If Judge Pelagalli took custody of your kids away...? 
                    Well, you obviously did something to deserve it.
           I don’t think that TROOPER CARTER understood that for a guy twice my size...?
           I knew I could break his legs.
           If I keep thinking about how he SAID that...
           Then I’m gonna just stay pissed off.
           Might even bubble over into an unstoppable fit of rage where I just go ahead and do that.
           Unfortunately, nobody is ALLOWED to be that honest with people.
           So, some things that a law man is supposed to ENFORCE...?
           ...they don’t do that at all.
    Brown: These violent thoughts you have... 
           ...do they happen often...?
    Me   : No. 
           However, they occur when someone says something foolish, insulting, AND manipulative.
           So like, when I told Mark Sheehan that I was being censored, and my equipment was being attacked, 
           he thought all that stuff was mad funny, so that’s why he wrote it in his report. 
           What he didn’t find all that funny though, was being told that my neighbor tried to assault me 
           on my property... 
           Cause Mark had already written down so much information already, would’ve been a waste of paper 
           for him to write down MY version of what happened that day...
    Brown: Alright. 
           Let’s just briefly consider that maybe you’ve been pissing off some of the local police with 
           your antics, now they’re intentionally ignoring crimes and stuff you’re reporting to them...
    Me   : Yeah, what would I do, if that’s actually what’s been goin’ on...?
           I don’t think that’s what’s happening anymore.
           But- you know, saying things over and over again causes some people to think I’m crying WOLF.
           Such as my mother.
    Brown: Well, there’s really not much you can do. 
           If someone has a badge, and doesn’t like you, they don’t have to TELL you...
    Me   : I understand that...
    Brown: I guess the best thing you could probably do, 
           ...is write an apology letter to all of those police officers you’ve offended...
    Me   : I have a much better idea.
           Maybe the ones I genuinely feel bad about humiliating, cause in some cases I do go too far to 
           make a point, they’ll write themselves into the story with little tidbits or clues that I wind 
           up stumbling (across/into).
    Brown: I mean, even in the cases where you feel like a cop is definitely breaking the law, 
           and trying to kill you, or write as many false tickets as possible...
           You gotta write an apology letter to them too.
    Me   : Nah, I’ll pass.
           Once I’ve identified a CREDIBLE THREAT, that’s pretty difficult to unwrite.
           Scott Schelling will remain a PERMANENT THREAT.
           So will Deputy Pirrone, “Scrotes”.
           I don’t insult people unless they’ve done something to deserve being insulted.
           IF I HAPPEN TO HAVE MADE A MISTAKE, I own up to that mistake.
           Some of them can’t do that.
    Brown: I mean, the way I see it buddy...? 
           ...the ball is in their court. 
    Me   : Depends on what you mean by "they/their".
           Because there’s multiple sides here, and they all overlap to some extent.
    Brown: There’s no way in hell I’ll be able to do anything about some dirty cops trying to slander you,
           or even killing you. 
           You just gotta learn to cope with the situation...
    Me   : That doesn’t sound like a very CREATIVE solution, at all.
           Is that why nobody from your organization has had this conversation with me yet...?
    Brown: Yeah man...~! 
           Just cause some hothead officer that has a good arrest rate screwed up in a few cases, 
           doesn’t make them a less valuable asset to the entire organization.
    Me   : *chuckles* Lol. 
           It doesn’t...?!? 
           I just laughed like HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON did after KILLING some dude...~!
           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmIRYvJQeHM 
           Killing somebody like THAT, is DEFINITELY worth a quick CHUCKLE, when you have a TOTAL LACK OF EMPATHY.
    Brown: Nah man, it’s just a numbers game.
    Me   : I mean, what if this hacker or team of hackers disabled my device to destroy the:
           - (1) video file I showed to Trooper Leavey on May 27th, 2020...?
    Brown: I mean, what you’re saying sounds like a mistake that anybody could make...
    Me   : I’m not just ANYBODY dude... 
           ...I used to work for ASURION/IFIXURI, so that means I actually used my own HANDS, and TOOLS...
           ...to like, REPAIR SMARTPHONES, like, on a DAILY BASIS...
           ...like, OFFICIALLY...
           ...like, BETTER THAN PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY WORK FOR APPLE.
           Can’t just assume that I’m gonna be like everybody else, 
           ...and attempt to enter the wrong passcode 10 times.
           Cause if APPLE tells a girl like KEILA at the APPLE STORE at CROSSGATES, 
           to say that a DEVICE CAN ONLY BE DISABLED...
           ...if SOME DUMBASS ACCIDENTALLY ENTERS IN THE WRONG PASSCODE 10 TIMES...
           ...then it means that KEILA is TALKING OUT OF HER ASS...
           ...and DOESN’T KNOW IT.
           Cause someone who calls themselves an EXPERT, might say that... 
           ...not realizing that I have A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE THAN THEY DO... 
           ...so what they’re saying is a LITERAL IMPOSSIBILITY.
    Brown: C’mon dude, you’re tellin’ me that you showed Trooper Leavey a portion of this "video" with 
           these kids faces in it...?
    Me   : Yep. 
           Literally showed that fuckin’ dude, who I’ve serviced BEFORE at COMPUTER ANSWERS.
           Lee Davenport Sr. was in a white van right behind him that day.
           I had concerns that the 2x guys that tried to get me...? 
           They might’ve been going house to house killing people.
    Brown: But, that sounds nuts dude...
    Me   : It seemed somewhat PLAUSIBLE, considering that I had an encounter with these (2) queer faced fuckbags...
           ...outside of Computer Answers...
           ...and I think JAMES DEVOE knows who they are...
           ...and SCOTT SALVADORE knows who they are...
           ...and RYAN WARD knows who they are...
           ...and CHRISTINA CZAIKOWSKI knows who they are...
           ...and THEY HELD A GUN TO MEGHAN ALEXANDER’S HEAD in HILLSIDE TRAILER PARK back in like 2011 or 2012.
           ...there were (3) of them that day.
    Brown: How do you know they were even QUEERS...? 
           Or, trying to hurt you...?
    Me   : Hm.
           Honestly, I just ASSUME that they’re cock smokers.
    Brown: *chuckles* Lol, ‘cock smokers’...?
    Me   : Yeah.
           It’s like, the English, suckin’ on some fags, which is a nickname for cigarettes.
           And, they smoke an entire pack of fags.
           Chain smoking em.
           One, right after another.
           Now, switch all of those cigarettes with dicks.
           That’s what a cock smoker, is.
           Now, imagine TWO of em, tryin’ to kill ya.
    Brown: *laughs uncontrollably for like, a few moments* DUDE...
    Me   : Go ahead, let it all out. Take as much time laughin’ as you need...
    Brown: *continues to laugh for like, an additional couple minutes*
    Me   : You done yet...?
    Brown: Yeah.
    Me   : Alright. 
           How do I know they’re cock smokers...?
           Well, it could be because I made an audio recording on May 25th, 2020 walking between SPEEDWAY at 
           Route 9/146, toward COMPUTER ANSWERS. 
           In that recording, these guys TRIED TO HIT ME, and then I basically “caught on” to the charade,
           THEN, I said some shit.
           I said I was ABOUT to hack into the COMPUTER ANSWERS network that I... 
           ...check this out... 
           ...when I used to work there, I totally PURCHASED THAT CISCO AIRONET 1140 SERIES ACCESS POINT...
           ...from an NFRASTRUCTURE EMPLOYEE THAT SOLD IT TO US...
           ...and then I FLASHED THE FIRMWARE FROM LIGHTWEIGHT CONTROL ACCESS MODE...
           ...TO STANDALONE ACCESS MODE...
           ...then I used the ‘WEB INTERFACE’, to configure the fucking thing SOMETIME IN 2018... 
           And, since NO ONE ELSE WHO WORKS AT COMPUTER ANSWERS KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT...?
           ...they NEVER CHANGED THE CONFIGURATION...
           ...the EMPLOYEES AT COMPUTER ANSWERS...
           ...NEVER KNEW THAT I STILL HAD ACCESS...
           ...because that’s how fuckin’ stupid they are. (← Beginning and the end of me being an actual expert)
           That access point had the SAME CONFIGURATION on MAY 25th-26th, 2020.
           Amazing, right...?
           Almost like I HAD to have been an EXPERT, at SKULL-FUCKING PEOPLE...
           ...that are A LOT LESS INTELLIGENT THAN I AM.
           (Just so we’re clear...? ^ This is something that SCOTT SCHELLING had knowledge of, based on the fact
            that he asked me about the audio recordings in front of my house, on the ticket that Captain Brown
            gave me, in February 2021)
    Brown: So, why would you say you were gonna hack the network you configured...?
    Me   : Because someone who thought they were a lot more intelligent than I am, didn’t realize that they’re WRONG.
           Not an uncommon thing for me to do, 
           1) show up, 
           2) do more shit than everybody else, 
           3) have some assholes talk shit about me afterward
           4) make all of those people look like fucking morons.
           Sometimes that can be people with ANY OF THESE POSITIONS:
           president, senator, congressmen, governor, assemblyman, mayor, judge, marshall, investigator, 
           police officer, trooper, sheriff, lawyer, public defender, superintendent, teacher, doctor, nurse, 
           business owner, public servant, social service worker, psychiatrist, psychologist...
           ...and EVEN THE ENTIRE STACK OF CYBERCOMMANDOS at EVERY GOVERNMENT AGENCY.
           Why...? How...?
           Cause of what I just said up above.
           A simple little mistake that could cause a LOT of chaos...
           they thought I was some little fuckboy that didn’t know what he was getting himself into that was
           slated to be KILLED, and DISPOSED OF, and now they have to work their asses off to CONTAIN ME.
           And they will definitely fail.
           And they know it, too.
    Brown: You sound like a real pretentious prick.
    Me   : Nah. 
           I’m not.
           I didn’t put "software engineers that work for Microsoft" on that list, did I...?
    Brown: *checks* Nah.
    Me   : Wanna know why...?
    Brown: ...why...?
    Me   : Cause they’re the smartest people in the world.
    Brown: *long pause* Alright buddy.
           Why would someone go through all this trouble, just for you...?
    Me   : Not real certain to be fair.
           But- 
           I had a feeling, that I was being surveilled by somebody ... remotely.
    Brown: What makes you think that...?
    Me   : Because I had been literally collecting instance after instance of someone interacting with my 
           1) laptop
           2) google drive account
           3) server
           4) smartphone
           5) notes application
           6) etc. 
           Almost as if I fucking knew EXACTLY what the fuck was happening, but anyone I chose to tell...?
           Couldn’t understand what I was saying.
           But, there’s a really good explanation for all of that.
           Derek Muller’s video on Veritasium about the man who accidentally killed the most people in history.
           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV3dnLzthDA 
           Like, imagine if Albert Einstein never actually convinced a SINGLE SOUL about the theory of relativity.
           If someone in TODAYS AGE went around doing EXACTLY THE SAME THING...?
           Nobody would ever believe him, and they would ALL call him psychotic and have him thrown in jail.
           That’s BASICALLY what I’ve been up against.
    Brown: Well, maybe you were being an asshole about it.
    Me   : Yeah, there I was... terrified because someone WAS stalking me, treating me like a PRODUCT,
           or PROPERTY, and... had an INTENTION to KILL me.
           They made this INTENTION as clear as fucking day, to ME.
           So, when I kept telling people, and they kept trying to shut the door in my face, 
           then I started screaming and yelling at people.
           Why...?
           Uh, cause I knew someone was trying to kill me, or planning on it.
           ...every single person I’ve told...?
           They’re morons that don’t understand WHY.
           I don’t think everyone has ignored me though.
           I think some people know, and they’re terrified.
           As for everybody else, I could TELL THEM WHY... OR, MANY REASONS WHY...
           But, it’s been over (2) years since all of that happened, and THAT means, people are fuckin’ oblivious.
           And, they don’t care.
           Even if it happened to THEM...?
           They STILL won’t care.
           Pretty sure they’ll care WHEN it happens to them...?
           But until then...?
           They won’t.
           They think "MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO ‘ROUND"
           Nah, it actually doesn’t.
           Morons think that.
           Scientists, teachers, engineers, and physicists...?
           They know that GRAVITY makes the world go ‘round.
           Anyway, I TOLD my stepfather (who thinks MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO ‘ROUND)...
           ...about this BLUE TRUCK that was STALKING ME...
           He stood there and pretended like he CARED alright, but then he said "Why would someone want to hurt YOU?"
           I told him, it’s because of my work.
           Then he *giggled like a little girl*, because he doesn’t understand.
           SOMEONE WAS COMMITTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT TO ME.
           LIKE, MANY PEOPLE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DONE THIS, AND GENERATED BUSINESSES AND BILLIONS OF 
           DOLLARS WORTH OF PROFIT...
           ...from my fuckin’ ideas.
           IDEAS THAT I HAD FIRST.
           As in STEALING MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
           Such as my THEORY about UNIVERSAL PROJECTION.
           Or like, the BIG BANG THEORY IS INACCURATE AND IMPOSSIBLE.
           <IT IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE NOTHING CAN MOVE FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT>
           THAT type of INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
           When someone STEALS YOUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, you have NO FUCKING CLUE how much money that idea was worth.
           My stepfather, who must have brain damage from all the lead poisoning when he was a kid...
           He thought it was SO FUCKING HILARIOUS...
           ...that he LAUGHED AT ME.
           Because, telling some drunk moron that someone ousted me from the company I WAS running (COMPUTER ANSWERS)...
           ...that I had a feeling someone was WATCHING ME DO STUFF ALL THE TIME...
           ...and HAD INTENTIONS TO KILL ME... 
           ...and that I’d go missing and never be found... 
           My stepfather thought that was HILARIOUS...~!
           Stepdad thought that was SO HILARIOUS, that he started LAUGHING in my face.
           I thought it was such an interesting response... that I stood there in TOTAL SHOCK.
           Then, a few seconds went by where I realized this dude apparently will be GRATEFUL if I get killed...
           As in, HOPES THAT SHIT DOES HAPPEN...
           Cause, LAUGHING AT SOMEBODY WHO IS TERRIFIED OF BEING KILLED...
           That means they hope you fuckin’ do, bro.
           It doesn’t mean ANYTHING ELSE.
           So, when he turned around, I punched him as hard as I could in the back of his head.
           Love ya, dad.
           Wish Michael Streeter caught the bullet that my REAL father caught in the back of HIS head.
           Cause my REAL FATHER would’ve NEVER FUCKIN’ LAUGHED AT ALL.
    Brown: That doesn’t give you the right to assault somebody because they’re laughing in your face...
    Me   : Nah, you’re right. 
           But the thing is, he doesn’t laugh like a little girl anymore whenever I talk to him.
    Brown: Let’s assume that some nefarious party was trying to hurt you... 
           I haven’t heard you say one legitimate reason WHY someone would go so far to do all of this, to you. 
           The individual, Michael C. Cook. 
           Why you...? 
           What is so special about you, to make you such an attractive target...?
    Me   : Sorta just said all that, but maybe I gotta repeat myself...
           I don’t know man, why did Jeff Truesell have to break into my house so many times and steal shit from me...? 
           Why didn’t he stop BEFORE I wound up having to ASSAULT him, and nearly kill him...?
    Brown: Idk but that sounds like a rather extreme response buddy...
    Me   : I know, but I attacked that kid in SELF DEFENSE because POLICE ARE OFTEN LAZY AND DONT WANNA WORK.
           KEVIN TOLLISEN understands how lazy the police are, since he was my ACTUAL ATTORNEY in 2002.
           Now he’s the Town of Halfmoon Supervisor.
           Yeah, he knew I was DEFENDING MYSELF.
           Usually when someone has a good reason to do something to me...
           It’s because someone actually thinks that I’m fucking STUPID.
           Like, this person INSULTS MY INTELLIGENCE when they try to pull a fast one on me, right...? 
           But then, suddenly I’m standing there with a baseball bat.
           Then, the countdown begins.
           JEFF eventually punched me in the face after TAUNTING ME for SEVERAL MINUTES along with ZACHARY TEMME.
           THEN, tried to take the baseball bat from me.
           THAT’S what I expected, and THAT’S when I tried to break JEFFS WRIST.
           I missed his wrist completely.
           I clipped his skull by accident.
           I paid the price for having to TAKE THE LAW INTO MY OWN HANDS, since the POLICE are OFTEN USELESS.
    Brown: Tell me about this incident in 2002.
    Me   : Well, JEFF TRUESELL and ZACHARY TEMME had BROKEN INTO MY MOTHERS HOUSE AGAIN, while I was at SUMMER SCHOOL.
           They thought it would be cool to:
           - dump lantern oil into my brand new 21" CRT monitor that I just spent like `$200 on
           - cut the strings on my electric bass that I hid under the bed (cause they kept breaking in)
           - smash the wooden cross that my recently deceased uncle Phillip made for my mother years before
           - I knew that if I were to CALL the POLICE for the (4th/5th) time...? 
           Ohhhhhhhh.....
           They were gonna SHOW UP, THROW THEIR HANDS UP, and say: 
               What can you really do about it, man...? 
               It is what it is.
           Ok. 
           Cool.
    Brown: So, you brought it upon yourself to assault some poor kid with a baseball bat...?
    Me   : Well, the way you phrase "poor kid" causes me to wanna smack ya across the fuckin’ face.
            Gives me a feeling that you feel bad for what I did to him after he terrorized ME for years.
    Brown: Alright. I’ll take the “poor kid” back then.
    Me   : Alright.
           Kid kept breaking into my house, over and over.
           And over.
           And over. 
           And over again... 
           Didn’t break into anyone elses’ house as OFTEN as HE BROKE INTO MINE.
           Not even fuckin’ exaggerating that.
           My Nintendo 64 was stolen in like, 1998 or something, when my mother, stepfather, 
           and I went to my uncle JEFF LANDAUERS.
           Who stole it...? 
           Some cocksucker named JEFFREY TRUESELL.
           ANDREW CLANCY bought the Nintendo 64 from JEFFREY TRUESELL, who STOLE IT FROM MY HOUSE.
           JEFF LANDAUER used to be the MAYOR of ALTAMONT, and was MARRIED to my aunt DEBORAH.
           Some kid named RJ BAGGINS or something, told me that ANDREW CLANCY had a NEW Nintendo 64~!
           Conveniently, and COINCIDENTALLY, Mine had just gotten STOLEN... 
           Oh wow...~!
           The police officer went to ANDREW CLANCY’s house, and recognized the writing on the paddle...
           It is (1) time out of so many times where that dude went above and beyond his scope of duty...
           But- JEFF didn’t get in trouble for that.
           Basically, he stole the thing, and ANDREW got in fuckin’ trouble for it.
           I didn’t wanna press charges on ANDREW, I wanted to press charges on JEFF.
           Couldn’t do that.          
           Then when my mother worked at Applebee’s for a while, some guy who worked there let my mother borrow
           a bowl to smoke pot out of, and JEFFREY TRUESELL stole that shit too.
           If something was suddenly MISSING...?
           JEFFREY TRUESELL fuckin’ stole it.
           Key to my house, gone...?
           Oh. It’s cause some fuckin’ cocksucker named JEFFREY TRUESELL STOLE IT.
           Money...? Jeff stole it.
           Video games...? Stole those too sometimes.
           This motherfucker had STOLEN A LOT OF SHIT FROM ME for like *checks watch* 13 fuckin’ years bro.
           Not one fuckin’ person on the god damn planet, was even CAPABLE, of putting a STOP to this kid.
           Not (1).
           Except...? 
           Me.
           Yeah, I can specifically name many times that JEFFREY TRUESELL VICTIMIZED ME...
           Such as when he molested me when I was 7 years old.
           Aw, man. Is that why the kids at SHEN, like, thought it’d be cool to call me names and stuff...?
           YEP. IT IS.       
           Getting away with it each and every single time, this kid would even FLICK PENNIES AND NICKELS...
           ...at the back of my SKULL, while I was on the "school bus"
           Not (1) fucking person was willing to do anything to say "Maybe we shouldn’t be doing this..."
           Cool, huh?
    Brown: Whatever man. 
           Doesn’t give you the right to kill somebody...
    Me   : I wasn’t TRYING to kill the guy. 
           I think that’s the part that MORONS, don’t understand. 
           I was TRYING to break his wrist, and I ONLY did that because I knew I was outnumbered.
           Like, I could tell the Town of Halfmoon Supervisor, KEVIN TOLLISEN, that his best job...?
           Sucked ass.
           Cause I still caught a FELONY for SELF DEFENSE.
    Brown: Yeah... 
           ...but, having a weapon on ya...?
    Me   : Alright consider this...
           ...what if, some dude walked in here right now...
           ...decided to pull out his weapon...
           ...aim it at you... 
           ...and told you to suck his dick, or you’re gonna die.
           What would you do...?
    Brown: Well now that’s a totally different story-
    Me   : Alright now, stop a quick second... 
           It’s not a different story at all.
           Same exact SCENARIO, different people.
           Imagine that you realized, telling ME “that’s a different story” causes me to want to attack you.
           But, I didn’t do that.
           Because, I know how to use my words to convey the sentiment.
           Doesn’t change the fact that people constantly think it’d be different story if it was THEM.
           All throughout society...
           “Good thing that didn’t happen to ME... Jeez.” (← SOCIETY)
    Brown: You can’t just attack people for saying stuff...
    Me   : Nah, not JUST for saying stuff, but feeling like "that’s a totally different story"... 
           Cause, if anything...? 
           My story is A LOT WORSE.
           It’s not the worst story in history, but, when I’m pretty honest with myself, nobody EVER says...
           “Man, I wish I were you, man. Holy fuck. What an amazing life you’ve lived.”
           Having my FATHER EXECUTED, BY A MERCENARY IN COLD BLOOD SUSPECTED OF BEING (HIRED/ASSOCIATED) WITH 
           A FAMILY MEMBER... and then THAT FAMILY MEMBER decides to TRY AND KILL ME TOO...
           Too bad my mother doesn’t understand how that’s even POSSIBLE.
           I do.
           That’s probably the worst part.
    Brown: No, it’s not-
    Me   : Ah, see I kinda wanna hit you in the face right now for trying to offer this rebuttal of yours. 
           Almost like you don’t realize that it’s not different at all.
    Brown: So what you’re saying is this dude was trying to kill you...?
    Me   : As for JEFFREY TRUESELL in 2002...? 
           Not (1) dude, more like 1) him, 2) ZACHARY TEMME, and 3) DONALD DEVOE.
           As for MAY 26th, 2020- not (1) dude, either.
           More like an ENTIRE TEAM OF THEM, basically, each with a BADGE, sometimes a GAVEL, or 
           BAR EXAM PASSED, or DOCTORATE.
           Like for instance, the (CLIFTON PARK/HALFMOON MAFIA), which BRUCE TANSKI and JOHN HOFFMAN, 
           are part of, among others, and they have serial killers on their team.
           Now, back in 2002, I felt it for years, that this kid... wanted to KILL me. 
           And, THAT’S why he thought it was COOL, to break into my RESIDENCE over, and over again... 
           ...and even paint this fuckin’ 515 symbol out in front of my house. 
           Cause, ALL OF THESE DUDES who were OLDER than me...? 
           They looked forward to the day that they could STAB ME TO DEATH.
           And then drink my blood in a satanic circle or ritual... offering me up as some sort of holy sacrifice.
           That’s how oblivious people were back in 2002.
           I knew that’s what was gonna happen.
           When I say I “knew”, I didn’t.
           I didn’t KNOW that’s what was gonna happen, I just understand the concept of:
           “When I KNOW, it’ll be too late.”
           Telling the police...?
           That’s pointless.
           That’s why I have a FELONY on my RECORD, instead of being dead that whole time.
           TOO BAD, that the POLICE are often MORONS.
           I feel bad for a lot of them too.
           Cause I’m sure it’s not FUN, to get into gun fights and have to get into a car and drive around,
           and not know if they’ll ever go home, cause it could be their last day.
           It’s a concept that my FATHER understood all too well.
           These kids, they felt like it’d be COOL, to use these SATANIC SYMBOLS to try and CAUSE ME FEAR.
           IT WORKED.
           Until I nearly killed JEFFREY TRUESELL, and then GRABBED ZACHARY TEMME BY THE THROAT, 
           THREW HIM AGAINST THE BASE OF A TREE, and proceeded to punch him in the face, over and over, 
           and over, and over, until I broke bones in his face with my bare hands.
           They were BOTH terrified of me after that.
           I’m not totally sure what the hell they were expecting, to be fair.
           They probably saw something that they hope they’ll never see again.
           Though, Jeff has since passed away.
    Brown: So really, it wasn’t different at all from a guy just suddenly pulling a weapon out and aiming it at me.
    Me   : Nope. 
           Actually, would’ve been nice if that’s ALL I had to deal with.
           These guys were day in, day out, stressing me the fuck out.
    Brown: Jeez. 
           Do a lot of people do this to you...?
    Me   : What, say something retarded and cause me to want to hit them really fuckin’ hard...?
    Brown: ...yeh...
    Me   : Oh, most definitely, my mother has done this every day of my entire life. 
           I don’t really understand it... 
           ...unless I consider that MAYBE, she has brain damage.
           I think when people SEE me, they think "ah it’s just this guy"... 
           and they don’t say to themselves something like "Whoa, better not fuck with this guy... holy shit."
    Brown: So, what you’re saying, is that back in 2002... 
           ...you had to nearly kill some kid with a baseball bat, because this kid tormented you for years...
    Me   : Yes. 
           That is EXACTLY what I’m saying.
           Fighting this dude, would’ve never solved the problem.
           Not without the training that RYAN WARD had.
           Then, that dude would’ve fucked off.
    Brown: Why didn’t you have your dad teach you to fight him or something...?
    Me   : Ah, so like, check this out... 
           That’s how I know people don’t actually listen to half of the shit I say.
           Pretty sure I already told ya, "my father was EXECUTED by a TEAM OF MERCENARIES, when I was a child". 
           So, he SURPRISINGLY, wasn’t around to do stuff like that...
           ...believe it or not.
           I would imagine that many of the kids I went to school with... 
           ...ALSO failed to realize that.
    Brown: C’mon dude, everybody has a dad that teaches them how to defend themselves... 
           ...you’re being ridiculous.
    Me   : Nah, actually. 
           I just started assaulting people when they made careless assumptions like that. 
           No warning whatsoever, either. 
           Someone making a careless assumption...?
           Oh, <assaulted>.
           Travis Mavica said something about my father in the cafeteria...?
           Oh cool, I attacked him too.
           I felt bad when his MOTHER had to APOLOGIZE FOR HIM...
           Because that wasn’t HER fault.
           Once I started doing that...? 
           THAT’S what started causing people to think "Wow... maybe I shouldn’t piss this guy off..."
    Brown: Interesting... 
           Anyway, how does this relate to Computer Answers...?
    Me   : Aha... 
           So, check this out... 
           When I talk with the owner of Computer Answers, I get the *same exact feeling* that I got from the kid...
           ...that I assaulted with the baseball bat. 
           Where like, he’s amazing at pretending to be my friend, and says so many nice wonderful things.
           LITERALLY makes a thing out of IMPRESSING the shit out of me, using (FALSE STATEMENTS/WORDS). 
           THEN... when he makes his way back to the crash pad or whatever...
           ...he goes right back to being the miserable fuck that doesn’t answer the phone nor manage his own business.
           ...for another 13 days. 
           Maybe I’d get lucky, and once out of 10 calls, the man would pick up and say:
           Pavel: Hey Mike. I’m RIGHT in the middle of suckin’ some dude’s dick right now, can I call ya back...?
           And I would think: 
           Me   : Well, at least he’s being honest about it... 
                  Do I REALLY wanna ask this dude a question when he’s in the middle of sucking some dude’s dick...?
                  Or, doing something where he’s not ACTUALLY putting any THOUGHT into his RESPONSES...?
           I learned that was actually pretty ignorant to do.
           Cause, when he was in the middle of something...? 
           Pavel : Oh yeh, bro. 
                   Totally. 
                   Do whatever you think is best.
           He’d greenlight taking `$20K from the company till, if there was an awesome story attached to it. 
           But, eventually I knew better. 
           I knew that when he wasn’t actually paying attention to words when I said them...? 
           He was runnin’ on autopilot.
    Brown: Well, that’s his problem, not yours.
    Me   : Heh. 
           Yeah, you say that, right...?
           But, the next time I’d see him, he WOULD be PAYING ATTENTION. 
           THEN, we’d have this conversation...
           Pavel : WHERE THE FUCK IS <SUCH AND SUCH>...? 
           Me    : Well, bro, I literally fuckin’ called ya about <SUCH AND SUCH>. 
                   We had a conversation where you gave me a thumbs up about <SUCH AND SUCH>.
                   Then, because YOU said <SUCH AND SUCH>...? 
                   I went ahead and <SUCH AND SUCH>, and <SUCH AND SUCH> was gravy.
           Pavel : I didn’t think you ACTUALLY meant THAT TYPE of <SUCH AND SUCH>...
           Me    : Well, just what EXACTLY, did you think I fuckin’ meant by <SUCH AND SUCH>...?
           Then, it didn’t matter if I had a perfectly legitimate leg to stand on. 
           This fully grown man would immediately experience a sudden rush of estrogen like I’d never seen before.
    Brown: Estrogen...? 
           Isn’t that like-
    Me   : ...the sexual hormone that a (female/gay-male) brain produces.
    Brown: Heh. 
           So, he’d throw a hissy fit is what you’re tellin’ me...?
    Me   : Correct, but that’s putting it lightly.
           I mean... this dude practically kicks the shit out of polar bears in Siberia, dude... 
           Effortlessly. 
           I wouldn’t call it a little "hissy fit"...
            ...I’d call a full-blown case of multiple personality disorder.
           Or like, schizophrenia. 
           Maybe even a brain aneurysm, or seizure...
    Brown: All of those things are totally different things though...
    Me   : I mean, sure...? 
           They probably are...? 
           But, I never stopped to question that Pavel’s responses were something few people are even capable of...
           Like, maybe ALL of those things combined.
           A Voltron of conniptions, so to speak.
    Brown: Sounds like he’d just get pissed off about whatever it was he absent-mindedly agreed to you doing...
    Me   : I mean, that’s a perfect way to sum it up, in the lightest possible shade you could...
           But, I’m fairly certain something MUCH MORE SERIOUS was happening... 
           Like, imagine a baby that grew up, whenever his pacifier wasn’t around, well...
           Now you’re REAL fucked, dude.
           Cause, the fully grown man-baby didn’t realize what it was he was agreeing to.
           Whereby allowing him to amplify his "hissy fit", causing absolute chaos, mayhem... 
           ...and eventually I just started saying the worst possible thing at the worst possible moment...
           ...to get this dude to shut the fuck up. 
           For instance...
           Me : Well Pavel, it’s not like you’re the one doing any fucking work buddy, so don’t worry about it.
    Brown: Wow. 
           Can’t believe you would ever tell the owner of a company that...
    Me   : Oh yeah. 
           I decided to start pushing this motherfuckers buttons because I was right. 
           He wasn’t doing any fucking work. 
           Dwayne and I were doing most of the work, carrying the company. 
           Even though they both knew damn well that I was 
           1) correct, 
           2) happened to be the most profitable person in the company... 
           ...the man was still finding ways to cling onto that sudden burst of estrogen in his system.
           Estrogen alarms get kicked off in one of two ways.
           1) you tell some female to suck your dick... or,
           2) <anything> that really pisses em off.
    Brown: Did you two ever get into a fight...?
    Me   : Surprisingly, not in an actual fist fight. 
           Don’t get me wrong, he is a big dude.
           But sometimes even the biggest dude in the room might be susceptible to being clobbered by a penis.
           That’s a metaphor.
           I don’t think he understood the fact that even though he knew damn well that I was:
           1) highly skilled at running his business
           2) consistently profitable and 
           3) knowledgeable
           ...he still held onto some layer of pride. 
           To him...? 
           It was as if he would rather make a lot less money "running" his business, 
           than to swallow his pride (or some dude’s jizz), and allow me to run the company as if I were 
           the actual factual legitimate motherfucker who owned the place. 
           Cause, this dude knew... 
           He could feel it in his bones every time he saw me... 
           I was just a lot more knowledgeable and capable at running his business, than him or his VP.
           Will either of them admit that...? They will never fuckin’ tell a single soul, but they will 
           when they’re looking at themselves in the mirror...
           Them : Damn dude. 
                  Should’ve just let MIKE run the fuckin’ show.
                  *sigh* Oh well, man...
           Too much pride.
           Just thinking about the words in that statement, causes them to distract themselves mid-sentence... 
           Them : Hm... 
                  ...is Michael C. fuckin’ Cook Sr., the BEST candidate to run COMPUTER ANSWERS...? 
           Right smack dab in the middle of them thinking about asking themselves that question...
           ...they saw a Dunkin Donuts sign, for like a brand new sandwich that they have. 
           NOW, they forgot to finish asking themselves that question... 
           NOW, they’re in line at Dunkin Donuts... 
           ...waiting to taste such an amazing, glorious, new fuckin’ sandwich at Dunkin Donuts...
           ...the bacon, is literally coated in sugar.
           The bun, is like, baked by an actual angel from heaven...
           It said “limited time only” on the sign.
           They’re not gonna pass that up.
    Brown: I mean, who doesn’t wanna try a brand new breakfast sandwich at Dunkin’ Donuts...? 
           They do legitimately have some good breakfast sandwiches.
    Me   : Oh... 
           ...trust me.
           I’m well aware.
    Brown: I mean, do you really think that Pavel Zaichenko would go that far... 
           ...and like, try to kill ya...? 
    Me   : To prevent me from outdoing him on any official capacity whatsoever...? 
           Absolutely. 
           It’s a gut feeling, it has the same exact Jeff Truesell vibe to it too... 
           ...a tough son of a bitch that knows I’ve got what it takes to outdo him... 
           See, Jeff kept doing this shit to me because he was AFRAID of me.
           People don’t understand it.
           JEFFREY TRUESELL, was TERRIFIED of me, and that is why he bullied me for so many years.
           But, for some reason... 
           ...gotta keep treating me like I’m a fuckin’ idiot or something. 
           He knows that I’m no idiot,
           Because all of the intellectual property that he just "snatched" from me, 
           it’s worth his running business’ profit.
           Cool, huh?
           He STILL knows, he would make a hell of a lot more money, if I convinced him to fuck off for a change... 
           ...and then said to him, "That’s how how an ACTUAL EXPERT would do that."
           Estrogen alarms MIGHT start to go off...?
           But then add in... "Let me show you how it’s done."
           Then he’s like scratchin’ his head, cause... 
           ...he DOES wanna know how an ACTUAL EXPERT would do that...
           ...so he’s CURTAILED the estrogen alarm, for now...
           ...with great suspense, he’ll watch every single move.
           At the end of all that...? 
           He fuckin’ learned how to do it correctly.
    Brown: Not unlike how you keep saying that to US, the ACTUAL POLICE...
    Me   : Correct.
           Sometimes, the people that call themselves experts, have to be SHOWN how to do things CORRECTLY.
           The MONEY isn’t as important as the PRIDE factor.
           So like, dudes like ERIC CATRICALA, he’ll be impressed too, and wonder 
           Eric : Alright fuckface. 
                  Show me how it’s done.
                  I wanna see this shit.
           Me   : Fine. *I show him how it’s done*
           Eric : Well, holy fuck. 
                  That looks like something an actual expert would do.
           Cause he just thought I was some annoying prick or something, and that I should get fuckin’ whacked...
           Then he’d send these soldiers after me...
           ...and they kept fuckin’ up the job.
           So then, ERIC CATRICALA had to roll up his sleeves and say...
           Eric : Sometimes, when you want something done, you gotta do it yourself...
           ...then, he too, will ALSO fuck up that job.
           It perplexes this dude how many times I’ve ‘accidentally’ slipped right by.
    Brown: So, you think he had something to do with these guys trying to kill ya...?
    Me   : Well, I don’t know for sure. 
           I mean, I did accidentally take a picture of the Boomer McCloud Plaza IMMEDIATELY before I started
           recording the video, IMG_0647.mov, from like 05/25/20 2343 → 05/26/20 0004?
           Regardless, the video that I showed to Trooper Leavey, started right near the Catricala Funeral Home.
           Honestly, whether it’s Pavel, or the 2 kids with Pegasus, or it’s Catricala, or Tanski, or Hoffman...
           I don’t know. I think they all had a hand in it...
           All-for-one, and One-for-all... 
           Mafiosos.
           Could’ve been separate attempts that they ALL made, and ALL of them keep failing, like, MISERABLY.
           Maybe it all boils down to the fact that I would often call PAVEL a cocksucker.
           Maybe he really is one. 
           Maybe that’s the real reason why he’s gotta be the guy in control of the company.
           No matter if he makes a lot less money than when I ran things...
    Brown: This sounds totally moronic though...
    Me   : Heh.
           I thought that too for a real long time... 
           But- then I started thinking about VLADIMIR PUTIN and how stupid HE is. 
           I don’t understand why people think that man is intelligent.
           You see, I think SOME of these Russians really cannot help that they think some of the most genuinely
           retarded shit known to man. 
           So for instance, I’d say to Pavel 
           Me    : Hey, how would you like to let an ACTUAL EXPERT run your business...? 
           Pavel : But, Mike... 
                   I already AM one, dude...
           Me    : *chuckles* Lol. 
                   You’re pretty funny buddy.
           Pavel : I, wasn’t trying to be...
           Me    : *chuckles* Lol. 
                   *chuckling turns to a dead halt* Nah, I know that buddy.
                   You fuckin’ suck ass at running this company.
                   That’s how a dude named Clifford Miller, stole about `$150K that I generated for your ass...
                   ...cause you were too busy sucking some dudes’ dick, instead of making sure that’d never happen.
           Pavel : Dude. 
                   What do you mean an ACTUAL EXPERT...?
           He knew what I meant by that each time... 
           A person that has legitimate certificates, training, experience, and knowledge about computers. 
           It was never a trick question or anything.
           No reverse psychology.
           No trickery.
           Just 100% being honest.
    Brown: Well, I could understand how such an attractive offer where an ACTUAL EXPERT rolls up their sleeves...
           ...and tells the guy to fuck off... 
           ...wouldn’t FEEL like a real attractive offer at, all when push comes to shove...
    Me   : Oh yeh, I understand what you’re sayin’. 
           It’s probably because there’s NO WAY, that I could EVER convince a [RUSSIAN] like him...
           ...that he fuckin’ sucks ass at what he does...
           ...and that prevents any GOOD IDEA from being formed in his OWN brain.
           So, it’s like “Well, I wish I could fuckin’ come up with a cool idea...”
           Cause then, the deal would’ve been done by now. 
           Then again, maybe he’s in denial.
           Dude would’ve made AT LEAST 10% more each (month/year) that’s gone by, than he has been making 
           without me being there.
           He knows this. 
           It’s like he was running at about (4/5) out of 10 before I came...
           ...then he was running at 10 out of 10 while I was there...
           ...now he’s running at maybe 6 out of 10...
           He’s in business because he likes having a series of LOCK BOXES to collect... 
           ...and CUSTOMERS to SPY ON, for MOTHER RUSSIA.
           Who am I to judge...? 
           I mean, I only ran the entire business and tried to tell him that people were stealing money from the 
           company. Ya know, that involved basically tearing everything apart, and build everything from scratch, 
           and part of that process involved his (CRM/Customer Relationship Manager, basically Quickbooks but 
           for managing all of the stores issues and tickets). Because I wanted to understand how I could bring
           in a `$5,000 check, and SOMEHOW, only get like 20% of that check, or less.
           He was busy doing something elsewhere, in addition to being bad at math.
           I offered him contracts that made a lot of sense, he thought “charge double, pay out half”. 
           Probably wouldn’t have had people stealing money from the business if another task felt like a suitable
           activity to Pavel.
           I mean, hell... 
           Going to EACH STORE ONCE a week, and just, opening (1) cash drawer for the day...?
           THAT ALONE, would’ve actually been EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE.
           Not as IMPRESSIVE as putting `$3,000.00 USD into ANY of the CASH DRAWERS he felt compelled to open...?
           But still, OPENING CASH DRAWERS...?
           Even just (1) of his own store registers being opened by HIM, would’ve been an amazing sight to see. 
           Even DWAYNE would probably be THRILLED to know that PAVEL still knows his way around.
    Brown: I mean, *shrugs* seems like such a minimal investment of time for him to make...
    Me   : Yeah, definitely. 
           It does, doesn’t it?
    Brown: If he maybe worked a couple of hours, as well, maybe it wouldn’t feel so POINTLESS...
    Me   : Now look buddy... 
           ...opening (1) cash register isn’t POINTLESS at all. 
           There’s a LOT of steps involved. 
           1) Gotta open the cash drawer, 
           2) start counting the dollar bills and stuff, 
           3) then you gotta get the coin machine to start counting all the change for ya... 
           at a bare minimum, it takes a few minutes...
    Brown: Are you being facetious right now...? 
           Or *shakes head* are you really trying to tell me that opening a cash drawer is somewhat difficult...?
    Me   : For THIS GUY...? 
           ...to suddenly decide to be more involved in the business...? 
           ...choosing to start off with a task that he can do without asking anyone for assistance...? 
           Absolutely.
           As Jeff Bezos says, "Big things start small, man."
    Brown: That is fucking laughable buddy...
    Me   : I’m actually pretty offended that you would say that... (sarcasm)
    Brown: No, you’re not offended at all, you’re doing some reverse psychology right now.
    Me   : Nah, man, you don’t get it. 
           I used to tell DWAYNE and PAVEL, all the time...? 
           THEY were REALLY GOIN’ PLACES.... 
           Because, it didn’t matter who got paid what...
           As long as SOMEBODY got SOMETHING...? 
           Their mission would remain ongoing.
    Brown: YEAH OK BUDDY... 
           So, dude starts paying you `$10 a week for 120 hours a week...? 
           Get outta here.
    Me   : Fine. 
           I’ll leave.
           Take it easy...
    Brown: NAH BRO...
           I was being sarcastic.
           I wanna hear this story.
    Me   : Alright then.
           Look, if I was doing it to support everybody elses family...? 
           I (would/did), allow my employer to pay me `$10 for 2 weeks worth of work.
           No problem, dude.
           Everyone elses family except mine, is more important.
           I believe that whole heartedly, so, just keep doin’ that bro.
           I’ve got your back.
           Who cares if you’ve got mine...?
           Cause if they weren’t gonna support their own family...? 
           Someone HAD to... 
           Most customers of Computer Answers don’t even realize, I supported the entire company for years.
           Lester McNair, Cliff Miller, Marquese Barnes, Dahl Todd, Brandon Dibble...? 
           Literally every single one of these guys was able to support THEIR OWN family...
           ...because I already did that work FOR them. 
           Consistently too. 
           And, Pavel’s too. 
           There wasn’t a single day that went by where I wasn’t able to support everybody’s family...
           Basically like I was Benjamin fuckin’ Franklin, and I wrote the Constitution of the United States of America.
           All they had to do, was just sign it, and they got paid too.
           Just like the forms that the Department of Labor gave to Pavel when he was being investigated.
           Handed all of us a form to sign, and THEN Pavel would fill out the rest.
    Brown: I have a feeling you’re not even remotely kidding about that...
    Me   : Nah man. 
           I’m not. 
           It got to the point where I had to start banging somebody’s girlfriend too...
    Brown: *laughs* LOL. 
           Did you really...?
    Me   : Yeh man, what do you think, I’m makin’ that up...? 
           Her name, is Renee.
           She... was quite handy, believe it or not.
           *shakes head* Unbelievable, man... you really think I would lie about something like that...?
    Brown: Nah, I’m just thinking, like...
           why couldn’t any of these guys support their OWN family, 
           why did they have to make you do all of the heavy lifting...?
    Me   : To be honest, I asked MYSELF that question all that time.
           I don’t really know, man. 
           Sometimes in life you’re just expected to take one for the team. 
           So if you do that enough times, then OBVIOUSLY, you have to fuck somebody’s girlfriend.
           The team surely appreciates the hard work you do.
           Then when YOU’RE not around...? 
           They’ll tell other people what a fucking moron or tool you are... 
           THEN, when their GIRLFRIEND tells YOU that’s what they SAY when you’re NOT AROUND...? 
           That’s the moment where you just gotta have sex with that dude’s girlfriend. 
           And, make her violently orgasm over and over.
           For like, 10 minutes straight... her entire body is gonna be convulsing, cause she is STILL orgasming.
           Cause...
           Maybe they can talk shit about how their girlfriend was suddenly in a much better mood all the time... 
           I mean, it’s not like I did that for every one of their girlfriends...
    Brown: Well, maybe you were such an asshole for doing everybody favors all the time...
    Me   : I know. 
           That’s what I came to understand. 
           I was a fuckin’ douchebag that whole time I worked all those hours that the owner of the company...
           ...would’ve never worked if he had to... 
           ...cause I’d imagine that the company could actually be more profitable if the dude "participated"...
           ...in profit generating related activities such as opening a cash drawer, at least once a week. 
           Maybe even like "rebooting a cable modem or network switch"... 
           But, can’t expect the owner of the company to know how to do those things after a while.
    Brown: So, what you’re telling me is that this dude just wanted to make money and not do any fuckin’ work...?
           ...for the money he was pulling from the boxes...?
    Me   : That is a fairly accurate way to put it all into perspective.
    Brown: What about managing his accounts, or bills, landlord payments, insurance, power, internet...?
    Me   : Well, what about all of that...?
    Brown: This dude never managed any of that...?
    Me   : Not to my knowledge... 
           He lost the East Greenbush store because he didn’t actually care about paying the rent there.
           I mean, maybe every once in a while if he was playing a video game on his smartphone... 
           ...maybe he might get BORED and check out any of his dozen `$negativethousandsofdollars credit cards
           he has at any given moment... 
    Brown: How’s this dude STILL in business then, if all his accounts are negative...?
    Me   : *chuckles* You... *points* You, my new best friend in the world... 
           ...you’re asking the million dollar question right there... 
           I think the ACTUAL explanation, is that he will pay a single card off...
           ...then use THAT card to pay off OTHER cards... 
           ...until that ONE CARD is MAXED OUT again... 
           ...then he’s like: 
           Pavel: Oh fuck...
                  Maxed out that card. 
                  What am I gonna do NOW, man...? 
                  Fuck~! 
           ...then he waits until the next earliest day he can go around collecting the lock boxes... 
           ...then he repeats this process.
    Brown: There’s gotta be more to it than that...
    Me   : Heh. 
           Nah man. 
           I think that’s literally ALL there is to it. 
           Just like how (MI5/KGB) AGENT <MICHAEL ZURLO> does that too.
           Anything more complicated than that could cause him to have to sit down at an actual desk... 
           THAT ALONE... might be too stressful for him. 
           So, after he manages to sit down at a desk, at least a couple hours for him to catch his breath...
           ...and allow his mind to get ready to look at the accounts...
    Brown: You know you’re really makin’ this dude sound like a completely ridiculous human being... 
           ...right?
    Me   : No fuckin’ way...
           ...am I?
    Brown: Yeah man... 
           Like, the dude’s gonna have to sit at an ACTUAL DESK, and WAIT for his BRAIN to "catch up"...? 
    Me   : Yeah man. 
           That could give him VERTIGO or some shit...
           That’s dangerous.
    Brown: *laughs* LOL vertigo...? 
           The dizzy spells...?
    Me   : They’re no joke buddy... 
           I might be hyperbolizing how out of touch the man truly is at running his own business...
           Or, AGENT MICHAEL ZURLO runs the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office...
    Brown: Yeah. 
           I’d say that you’re doing a lot more than just hyperbolizing what this dude’s doing for his business...
           And, offending me in every possible way, about my supervisor.
    Me   : There’s no question about it. 
           Maybe he does a lot more for the business than I believe. 
    Brown: I mean, if you think he had something to do with these two dudes poppin’ outta nowhere like friggen Batman
           or some shit... 
           ...using a program made by the NSO Group in Israel... 
           ...then obviously he’s gotta be more involved than you’re tellin’ me. 
           A LOT more involved.
    Me   : AHA.
           No shit, buddy. 
           Involved in the WRONG WAY, though.
           Maybe he is. 
           Maybe it’s no laughing matter when it comes down to his game face. 
           Maybe when I was mad busy supporting everybody elses family, I felt a need to start banging this one 
           dude’s girlfriend.
           So, when I started doing that, THEN Pavel came in super quick, and did a shitload of work in that small 
           window of time.
           Such a legendary amount of tedious, time-consuming work, that he was able to:
           1) arrive
           2) doing anything work related
           3) take the fuck off like a bat outta hell
           ...without me even NOTICING.
           MAYBE... 
           ...this dude has the ability to be in MULTIPLE PLACES at the SAME EXACT TIME... 
           MAYBE...
           I was the one who was the REAL fuckfaced clown, that ENTIRE TIME, for thinking that...
           ...multiple-places-at-the-same-time phenomenon was fucking impossible or moronic... 
           Because of that...? 
           Well, now I know, Pavel and a few other guys...
           Oh, they’ve got a few tricks up their fuckin’ sleeves, alright...
    Brown: Buddy, they obviously do.
    Me   : Alright.
           If that is the case, then I obviously have to wave a white flag.
           How the fuck could I, (1) guy, compete with that...?
           THAT is fucking impossible dude.
           I’m not god damn Goku. Or Vegeta. Or Trunks.
    Brown: That is a good question, buddy. 
           Either way you look at it, dude’s got your number apparently... 
           What the hell can YOU, Michael C. fuckin’ Cook...
           ...do about it...?
    Me   : I don’t know. 
           I guess, just... give up...? 
           I’ve failed.
           Dude had some extra-clutch maneuvers that, I just had no way to EXPECT or FORESEE... 
           Now, he’s looking in the mirror, chanting out loud to TAUNT me... 
           Pavel : Look who’s the idiot now, Mike... 
                   *shaking head* Told you I had this shit on lock, bro. 
                   You didn’t know what you were gettin’ yourself into...
           So, naturally, maybe I gotta build myself one of those boats that I can ride out to sea.
           And, just... 
           ...wait for the day to come. 
           A day where I could just bask in the sunlight, realize my entire life was a fuckin’ sick joke... 
           And then...? 
           Who knows.
           I’ll be out there for a while, though. 
           Pavel knows it. 
           Dwayne probably knows it too. 
           Both of them will have this group meeting where they talk about how Pavel had one of the most insane,
           and unexpected surprises up his sleeves... 
           ...being able to be in MULTIPLE-PLACES-AT-THE-SAME-EXACT-TIME. 
           It’s only considered IMPOSSIBLE, if you’re a fuckin’ COMPLETE MORON...
           ...like me.
    Brown: Are you done yet...? 
           With this bantering...?
    Me   : Yeah. 
           There’s no fuckin’ way in hell, that dude’s gonna come in on any day of the week to any of his stores, 
           and involve himself with a task even as minuscule as opening the fuckin’ cash drawers. 
           Nah.
           He might experience a full-blown burst of estrogen if he had to do something like that. 
           Then, nobody will be safe. 
           We can’t have that type of negativity or unpredictability at COMPUTER ANSWERS...
           ...and that’s why you can’t just go around, and OVERWHELM the OWNER of the COMPANY... 
           ...with a task that the employees do every fucking day.
           Cause, what if Pavel breaks a nail...? 
           Hm...?
    Brown: Dude.
    Me   : Everybody will be FUCKED...
           Dude broke a nail.
           Countin’ the fuckin’ cash in the cash drawer.
           Now nobody will hear the end of it.
           He’ll talk about it at the next meeting
           Pavel : Look guys...
                   I need you guys to understand...
                   ...that I *might* actually come into the stores...
                   ...and do some work with ya....
           Guys like Devin or even Liam, they’ll think that’s COOL for the first few seconds... 
           Guys  : ...really...?   
           Pavel : Yeh, man. 
                   Told myself that I need to be more INVOLVED in this company... 
           Guys  : Uh...
                   ...we’ve sorta got it all under control, Pavel... 
                   ...you sure you don’t wanna just stick to collecting the lock boxes...?
           Pavel : Nah, look... 
                   I appreciate you’re lookin’ out for me guys, I really do... 
                   But- I’ve sworn an oath to myself. 
                   *taps chest* I, need to 
                   *taps chest again* BE, more 
                   *taps chest again* COMMITTED, to doing 
                   *taps chest again* MORE, to assist 
                   *taps chest again* YOU GUYS, get the 
                   *taps chest again* JOB, done out there. 
           Guys look at each other in wild fuckin’ amazement, all of their facial expressions reveal confusion.
           Pavel : It’s the least I could do, really.
           Guy   : Alright man. 
                   It’s your company... 
                   ...what you say goes...
           Pavel : Look. 
                   *waves his hand around* 
                   I started this business with `$20, and a trenchcoat. 
                   People kept asking me "Why the hell do you always wear a trenchcoat...?" 
                   So, I told em...
                   *points at chest* My dad gave me this trenchcoat, as a good luck charm. 
                   He told me, as long as I wear this god damn thing everywhere I go...? 
                   People would recognize me in the trenchcoat. 
                   THEN, they would inevitably remember who I was.
                   And, why I was there.
                   Eventually...? 
                   A bunch of people would look back on the days where all I had was that `$20 and a trenchcoat... 
                   But- take a good look around you, boys. 
                   That trenchcoat AND that `$20, got me all this way... 
                   I’m not even sure where the hell that fuckin’ thing is anymore, but I know that without it...? 
                   None of us would even be here. 
                   And that’s the story of how I turned `$20 and a trenchcoat into fully realized dream.
           Guys  : Wait, what...?
           Pavel : That trenchcoat, AND the `$20, became the blueprint for success, guys.
                   Eventually it became the company you see today.  
                   *starts to cry slightly* You guys really have no clue how tough all these years have been. 
                   *sniffles* But, I’m a survivor.
                   *wipes tears from his eyes*
           Guys  : *the confusion on everybody’s faces dissipates*
                   *they ALL begin with very loud, boisterous round of applause* 
                   *cheering* 
                   *chanting* 
                   *chanting* Pavel! 
                   *chanting* Pavel! 
                   *chanting* Pavel! 
                   *chanting* Pavel! 
                   *chanting* Pavel! 
                   *chanting* Pavel! 
           Pavel : *sniffles* Gee, thanks guys. 
                   I really appreciate it... 
                   I appreciate ALL of you guys, AND, the hard work you’re all doing (that I don’t have to do).
           Guys  : Pavel... 
                   You’re a good man. (fuck you, dude)
           Pavel : *sniffles* ...you really mean that...? (fuckin’ idiots fell for it)
           Guys  : Yeh man. (nah, not at all ya fuckin’ clown)
                   Totally. 
                   Wouldn’t be here if we didn’t believe in you... (fuck you, bro)
    Brown: I’m gonna have to ask you to stop going on with this ridiculous fuckin’ story.
    Me   : What’s so ridiculous about it...?
    Brown: I don’t know if the man literally started his business with `$20 and a trenchcoat... 
           ...but that sounds like total bullshit.
    Me   : Heh. 
           I thought that too. 
           *shakes head* It’s true though. 
           He had this small little shop around the corner from Mild Wally’s, on North Lake Street. 
           Right next to the Baboushka Deli.
           For years, that shop experienced first hand, a man that really knows how to wear a fuckin’ trenchcoat. 
           The secret was, Pavel never spent that `$20...
    Brown: He didn’t...?
    Me   : Nah. 
           The man framed it, had all of his friends sign the thing, all of his friends and family wished him the best.
           They wished him the most success in life... 
           This business of his... would experience so many trying times. 
           There were MANY trying times for Pavel when he first started out... where he ALMOST spent that `$20.
           He had to figure out the components inside of a 
           1) desktop, then eventually he moved on to servicing 
           2) laptops... 
           ...the dude had to have known SOMETHING about computers after all...
           ...look at how far he’s come...?
    Brown: This has to be the dumbest fuckin’ story I’ve ever heard in my entire life...
    Me   : Look man. 
           Ask yourself some questions... 
           Where the hell did this son of a bitch come from...? 
    Brown: ...Russia, or Ukraine...
    Me   : *Pointing at SCSO* That’s right. 
           Them guys don’t fuck around...  
    Brown: So what you’re saying, is that they’re about as legitimate as they come.
           ...and if someone like you comes along...
           ...outperforming everybody that’s ever worked at the company...
    Me   : ...that Pavel will feel incredibly cheated. 
           I mean, that’d be like if I just came along, and showed you how to investigate crimes.
           All of a sudden, even though I’ve never officially worked for a police department...? 
           Well, I suddenly showed up and started giving you orders on how to do your job.
    Brown: I’d have a real problem with that, basically immediately.
    Me   : Yeah, but if you had a REAL investigator show you what you’re obviously doing wrong... 
           ...then you could learn how to IMPROVE and be more efficient. 
           That way, you’d be able to do MORE WORK, more accurately, in less time... 
    Brown: Then I would get paid less money for doing the same work in less time...
    Me   : Exactly. 
    Brown: Who in their right mind would wanna do that though...?
    Me   : What, do a better job in less time...?
    Brown: Yeah. 
           What the fuck pal...?
    Me   : Well, you raise an interesting point. 
           The more TIME you take to do the job... 
           ...the less "real work" you have to do... 
           ...why the hell would anybody in their right mind... 
           ...want to do MORE WORK... 
           ...in LESS TIME...
           ...if they’re gonna get paid the same amount of money...?
    Brown: Yeah. 
           Just listening to you even say that question out loud is upsetting...
    Me   : Look. 
           Eventually, some kid with a lot less experience may inevitably come. (like me)
           Then, when that guy solves 12 cases in the same amount of time it takes YOU to solve (1) case. (like me)
           Someone’s going to eventually ask the question: 
           Someone : Why the fuck do we pay the guy over there, to do a FRACTION of the work this new guy does...?
    Brown: Because of seniority...
    Me   : Yeah, but think about it. 
           If they hire ANOTHER new guy that works for the same rate of pay...
           ...then you’ll be sitting around expecting to be paid for doing the same amount of work... 
           ...but somebody ELSEWHERE thought that was fuckin’ stupid... 
           ...and now the other guys are purposely doing everything possible... 
           ...to keep you from reaching your retirement package...
    Brown: That’s bullshit though. 
           Nobody can solve 9 cases in the time it takes me to solve 1...
    Me   : I don’t doubt that at all.
           Experience matters, for sure.

Morons say that quite a lot, and the amount of SENSE it makes, is akin to having a screen door on 
a submarine, but- with logic. That begs the question though, how DOES somebody become rich? 

Do they follow some YouTube ad, watch/listen to somebody on YouTube like TechLead (as a millionaire), 
maybe MotleyFool, or stock investors...?

Well, their input is definitely worth consideration.
But, input alone will not necessarily make someone rich, as much as it may be good advice...
___________
| Fastest |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The FASTEST way to become a rich bastard, is probably to kill someone that has a lot of money, 
and take it. But, pretty sure it’s a fuckin’ REAL stupid idea, all across the board. 
Cause they’re way ahead of ya... 
I’ll say it again just to reinforce the point, that’s NOT A SMART WAY, odds are, someone’s 
gonna get their asshole stretched out (like Ted Cruz does by Exxon Mobil) in prison.

However, identity theft is essentially stealing someone’s money, without killing them at all.
If people choose to do that instead, they have a MUCH higher chance of success, because it happens 
all the time to a lot of people, and in many cases it was UNDETECTED.

This isn’t advice by the way, but that’s sorta what Cerberos and APT29 do.
It’s also how the 2020 US Federal Data Breach went down. 
Even still, rich bastards are way ahead of ya... 

Cause if they’re anything like I am, every time they’re about to go to sleep, they gotta check 
everything. Make sure everything’s fuckin’ safe and secure...? Cause they know, something COULD 
happen and they don’t wake up.

It’s a contingency that’s always on their mind.
They don’t want ANYBODY who’s not authorized, to have access to their shit.
So, even for APT29 “Cozy Bear” … that’s fuckin’ difficult to do for anybody.

So, there really isn’t a FAST way at all that doesn’t involve an IGNORANT plan,
UNLESS, you have CAPITAL or CONVINCE someone that has some, to make an investment... 
BUT- that’s not a hell of a lot different than sales.
______________	
| Best/Worst |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The “best” way to become insanely rich, is to use a deadly product that kills people, and hope 
for the best, that the government and public don’t cause a fuss.

In my opinion, it’s not the BEST way at all, because look at Richard Sackler...
That guy, I’ve already mentioned, has the superhuman ability to spread his ass cheeks. 
Wanna know how he learned to do that...? 
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(6,"Shoutout [+] Pablo Escobar",@"
Well, I’m not gonna say that Pablo Escobar did what Sackler does, BUT- 
Pablo Escobar was the cocaine kingpin in the 80’s/90’s in Columbia, making cocaine castles. 
This dude basically had SO MUCH fucking money, that he had to dig holes in the ground, 
and hide some here and there, everywhere... (Check out the show on Netflix)

Dude didn’t know where over 50% of his fuckin’ money was at one point...
Why...? America had such a HIGH DEMAND for this shit. 

That’s because a drug, that’s ADDICTIVE, is a pretty great way to EXPLOIT your way to success.

Pablo Escobar and his cartel was well known for being VERY VIOLENT and DEADLY, and 
was someone to be FEARED, for sure. 
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(6,"Overview (2)",@"
Richard Sackler took note of this (minus the fear aspect), and restored the Opium War.
During the invasion of Afghanistan, some military black ops would commandeer their opium farms and 
plantations, Afghanistan is home to the best climate to grow opium in the world, and at one point 
98% of the worlds opium came from this specific place. Then they would (harvest/process/etc.) and 
send the shit right back to the United States. 
	
As far as I can tell...? 
They did that up until about 5 years ago when people started making fentanyl. 
This is actually a backstory in the show “The Punisher” on Netflix, based on a true fuckin’ story.
(That’s 2x good Netflix shows)

Afghanistan became a lot less interesting after people started synthesizing the drugs they made. 
    
Anyway, Richard Sackler became a rich bastard by exploiting people who would get addicted to the 
medicine his company made and sold, although he was never even remotely fucking close to as rich 
as Pablo Escobar. 
	
Richard Sackler, is not someone anyone should really fear, but maybe some people do. 

Rich bastard, had a company that produced OxyContin alongside McKesson, pumping opiate based 
medications and drugs in the United States. These (2) companies distributed a product that was very 
unsafe, and became quite popular because someone lied to a lot of people... and now it is an epidemic.

| Safest |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The SAFEST way to become rich, requires a multitude of STRATEGIES and FACTORS, since I’m not 
ACTUALLY a rich bastard, I’ll just say → Whatever the top 10 billionaires did, is probably 
worthy of analysis and study. I’ll return to this point in a moment.

If someone eventually BECOMES rich, well, how rich can you really get...? 
And, which way did they become rich too...?

Did they become rich with a  SAFE way that was MORAL, or was it a  SAFE way that was IMMORAL...?
Did they become rich with a RISKY way that was MORAL, or was it a RISKY way that was IMMORAL...?

Morality comes into play quite a bit here, because some people truly think that to become rich, 
you just have to be a fuckin’ real evil prick with no morals at all. 
Not the case from what I can tell.

The things in common here are SAFE ways. That’s a fuckin’ mystery right there...
Once someone has enough money, then you’re considered equivalent to ROYALTY. 
    
It’s not the same thing as ACTUAL ROYALTY. But- you get a free security team that will watch all 
of your accounts and assets, and they’ll fuckin’ show up every morning with a newspaper and a coffee, 
and tell you what the hell happened while you were asleep.

Pretty sure Gates didn’t get where he is by doing real evil shit to people.
You know who did...? Richard Sackler.

If someone becomes rich by (EXPLOITATION or LYING) to a bunch of people, by doing some real IMMORAL 
and QUESTIONABLE shit to others... AND, you’re granted IMMUNITY from any potential criminal charges, 
then the BEST way to get rich and stay rich, is to do what he did... unfortunately.

That’s what the HIDDEN GOVERNMENT in America causes people to believe... 
	
 - Who cares about who dying...?
 - Just, do what he did
 - Don’t allow yourself to have a conscious at all
 - Richard Sackler is more important than anybody else
 - He is more important than any former president that ever lived
		
Nah, that’s the thing about REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY, people SHOULD tune the LAMBDA FUNCTION...
...in their brain...
...to think ALL of those statements are FUCKED UP, and not agree with any of it at all.

I’m not positive that someone is allowed to KEEP their FREE security team if they get demoted

Richard Sackler lost HIS "free security team", but he likes the idea of having someone answer 
his door, it still gives people the impression that he’s still rich and powerful.

They don’t realize, Richard Sackler just pays out of pocket at that point. 
So, he’s got a Reluctant Butler... 

Reluctant Butler shows up every morning and is inclined to say stuff to this dude for his paycheck. 
Doesn’t really have anywhere CLOSE to the level of control that Murdock has over Hannity.

Well, the answer is by being a lyin’ fuckface that became rich in a REALLY IMMORAL WAY.
One that SHOULD BE IN PRISON, cause KILLING PEOPLE ISN’T COOL... 
That’s how.

Whereas...

Hillary Clinton still has a free security team called "The Secret Service"
Because, as far as I can tell...? She’s still married to Bill Clinton...
He just so happens to have been, a "President of the United States of America" at one point.

They don’t get to OPT OUT once they OPT IN for the LIFETIME PROTECTION offered...
...at the end of their term in office.

Opting in, means that this LEGION OF SHARPSHOOTERS that JUMP IN FRONT OF ACTUAL BULLETS,

...these fearsome bastards with serious training...
...stick around for the remainder of that president’s life.

NOBODY will get ANYWHERE EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE to people like (BILL/HILLARY)... 
NOR fuck with their bank accounts, or estate, without them even knowing. 
	
The secret service ITSELF, is actually pretty fuckin’ cool.
However, there may be situations where they’re protecting somebody that did something REALLY IMMORAL.
For instance, George W. Bush. (← I don’t totally understand if he committed treason or not)

If Richard Sackler and Hillary Clinton were in a fuckin’ cage match, who would win...? 
Would they even allow it? Probably not. Even if Hillary said:

Clinton : Nah, I wanna fuckin’ fight this dude...
Sackler : *scoffs* Oh yeah, Mrs. Clinton...?
Clinton : Bro, I will fuck you up, even though I’m a woman.
Sackler : Yeah right, lady.
          *taps chest* I’ve got a reluctant butler, not the Secret Service.
Clinton : WOW. 
          This son of a bitch just...
          ...whipped out the fuckin’ big guns with THAT comment, holy FUCK.
          Bro, I don’t need the Secret Service to protect me from *points at Sackler* you.
Sackler : *scoffs* Listen lady...

 \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
	
...but then nobody gave a shit about what Sackler had to say after that.
At least in Hillary’s case, people still GENUINELY give a shit about what she has to say.
Sackler...? Nah. Fuck off bro.
Clinton...? I still listened to what she had to say when Madelline Albright passed away, with
Albrights daughters also.
Might confuse people when I stick up for Mrs. Clinton in some instances, cause she’s right.
	
She WOULD fuck that dude up.
I have a feeling that Hillary Clinton would actually kick the shit out of this dude, no contest.

^ All of that is beside the point, I’m afraid.

Certain people are never even brought into a courtroom, like Richard Sackler or her. 
They’re brought into a judge’s office, like (VIRTUALLY/OVER THE PHONE)... or maybe the judge will do

          I know bro. 
          What the hell.
Judge   : Look.
          They’re gonna have ya go into a conference room...
          As long as you keep saying "I don’t know", over and over...?
          ...you might not get in ANY trouble.
Sackler : I think I can do that.

Judge is gonna shake his head, and not be real pleased that he’s gotta work his ass off.
Why...? To keep Richard Sackler, a man who lied to a lot of people, and got MANY PEOPLE KILLED,
...out of prison. 
    
You’d think the LAWYERS were supposed to do that. 
Yeah, they do that ALSO. 
FYI: Hillary Clinton is well versed in LAW, cause she was a LAWYER at one point.
	
Lawyers AND the judges, AND the police... 
...they go to this dude’s house, he doesn’t go to THEM. 
Nope. Cause he’s as long as he’s got stacks of cash, he can still pay people to do stuff like that.

Anyway, I wouldn’t consider Hillary a BILLIONAIRE or ROYALTY, but, she’s still PLENTY IMPORTANT, being 
the former first lady - Bill didn’t get to be president without her help.

The question is, at what point can she break a law and get in trouble for it...?

That’s a good fuckin’ question, isn’t it...?
Because there should be a DIAGRAM, that exhibits how SEVERE something has to be...
...before exceptions can no longer be made.

Asking these questions shouldn’t OFFEND anybody.
But, maybe I did OFFEND somebody wicked important by (existing/questioning authority).
Probably sounds moronic, I offended Hillary Clinton by (existing/questioning authority).

Anyway, maybe the reason she didn’t get in trouble for leaking classified information, whereby 
causing a matter of national security, is cause... she has put up with so many pieces of trash and 
scum... It’s hard for her to have a sense of humor sometimes. But, James Comey knew she did. 
He considered that when he was talking with her back in July 2016...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Comey : Ya know, Hillary... 
        ...we’re gonna be characters in a lot of stories from here forward.
Her   : Yeah. 
        I know.
Bill  : Obviously, we can’t have my wife go to jail when she’s about to run for president.
Comey : Obviously. 
        Can’t let this fuckin’ douchebag Trump actually WIN...
Her   : Obviously. 
        He’s a fuckin’ moron.
Comey : Obviously.
Her   : He actually says he’s gonna make America great again... 
        *crosses arms* ...the fuck he will.
Bill  : It’s a hard job... 
        I don’t think he’s cut out for it.
Her   : Nah, definitely not. 
        No political experience, whatsoever.
Comey : Right, but- everyone in the Republican party is practically blowing this dude...
        ...they’re gonna want him to win.
Her   : Ugh. 
        Old wrinkly fuckface getting blown by members of his own party...?
Comey : Yep. 
        Chokin’ and strokin’. 
        All day long.
Bill  : *sigh* C’mon pal. 
        What the fuck.
Comey : *hands up* Hey, I’m just using an analogy. 
        Not sayin’ they actually do all that.
Her   : Yeah James. 
        That’s disturbing. 
        What the fuck is wrong with you...?
Comey : Look, Ms. Clinton, I’m here cause I’m supposed to arrest you.
Her   : *sigh* So, we’re just gonna let the orange skinned fuckface win the presidency...?
Comey : I know. 
        Bad timing. 
        This fuckin’ Julien Assange character is a real pain in the ass...
Her   : He’s not even really that cool in anybody’s book... 
        I’ve asked em all "Hey, is Assange cool in anybody’s book?" 
        They all said "Nah."
Comey : He’s cool in my book... 
        He’s earned my respect. 
        He’s makin’ everybody’s job a lot more difficult, rather than just believing all the bullshit.
Her   : What do you mean you respect that...? 
        Making your job harder...?
Comey : Ms. Clinton, this job is way too easy. 
        Too much power. 
        Somebody could tell me a joke...? 
        And even if I think that joke is funny...? 
        Oh... I can-
Bill  : ...arrest that sumbitch?
Comey : Yep. 
        I try not to do that very often, but... 
        ...the guys at the office know that I’ll make an example outta people for tryin’
        to be a fuckin’ comedian.
Her   : I mean, what if they’re actually funny though...?
Comey : Ms. Clinton, how do you think it would LOOK... 
        ...if I go to arrest somebody, and they say some shit that makes me burst with laughter...?
Her   : Never thought about it...
Comey : Yeah, it’ll look great. 
        I show up, dude says "What are you tryin’ to do, arrest me or something?" 
        Then I say "Yeah." 
        Then that sumbitch says something to make me laugh my ass off...? 
        Then I gotta wait for the humor to clear itself up so I can actually get the cuffs around 
        that dudes wrists.
        That’s if that dude didn’t just bolt... 
        Ya know? 
        Dude might’ve cracked a joke so he had time to take off.
        Then what...?
Her   : Well... 
        If it’s pretty funny though...
Comey : Nah, even if it IS funny, I gotta wait to laugh. 
        So, I drown out what they say, and when they’re in the back seat, and I’m drivin’ to the jail... 
        ...that’s when I reflect on what they said that was so funny... THEN I start laughin’.
        I’ll ask em, "Hey, what was it you said back there, before I put those cuffs on ya...?
        They’ll say "Etc."
        And that’s when I might actually laugh like I normally would.
        Dude gets confused too... 
        They may say "How come you didn’t like, laugh back there...?"
        That’s when I tell him.
        Then he’ll say "Oh. Well, that makes sense... 
        Probably could’ve gotten away if I told you this OTHER joke..."
        Then, we’ll just go back and forth with the jokes until we get to the jail.
        I’ll tell him "Look buddy. You’re a fuckin’ REAL comedian, for sure."
        "Too bad you’re stuck in a prison, pal..."
        That dude always has a sad look on his face too... 
        Doesn’t feel very fair... does it?
Her   : Nah. 
Comey : Ms. Clinton, there’s no way I could escort you to jail after doing this country 
        a service for so many years.  
        It’s unthinkable to me.
Her   : ...you really mean that James...?
Comey : Yep. 
        No doubt about it. 
        Do I think you really fucked Monica Lewinsky over...? 
        I most certainly do. 
        She didn’t deserve that shit.
Her   : ...she did suck Bills dick dude... 
        In the oval office...
Comey : Bill, were you involved in Monica somehow having her mouth on your dick at all...?
Bill  : ...
Comey : Yeah, Bill won’t say, but he is probably the one that asked Monica to do that.
Her   : Yeah well... that’s gotta stand for something...
Comey : Can’t just throw the book at anybody you don’t like. 
        Because, you should ALSO be upset with Bill for that whole situation.
Her   : I’ve forgiven Bill. 
        Haven’t forgiven her.
Comey : Well, you fucked up that woman’s life. 
        How can we call this a democracy, if I’m sitting here, talking with you,
        shaking my finger in your face...
Her   : So, I’m supposed to just be cool with her blowing Bill...? 
        In the oval office...?
Comey : Nah, not at all... 
        I’m just sayin’, you could’ve been the one doin’ that... 
Her   : What, blowing Bill in the oval office...?
Comey : Absolutely. 
        It’s totally legal for a president to get head from his own wife, even in the oval office. 
        Then, no need for a scandal.
Her   : Jeez. 
        Why the hell didn’t I think of that...?
Bill  : I dunno babe. 
        Probably the dozen secret service agents, constantly checkin’ up on me.
SS    : *opens the car door* Bill, you alright...?
Bill  : *gives him a wave* Yeah man. 
        I’m good.
SS    : Alright, just checkin’. *shuts the door*
Bill  : Yeah, it’s not easy. 
        They fuckin’ pop their head every once in a while, like, every 5 minutes.
Her   : Yeah well, you managed to get 5 minutes alone with HER... 
        ...not me though.
Bill  : Listen babe, stop draggin’ up the past. It’s over, can’t change what happened.
Her   : Nah, we can’t. 
        *starts pouting* Asshole.
Bill  : Babe... what the hell.
Her   : Nah, I can be fuckin’ pissed about it still, if I wanna be. 
        So... Fuck you, dude.
Comey : Now, now, Ms. Clinton, what type of example or precedent would YOU be setting for other people... 
        ...if you just stay mad at Bill...?
Her   : Well, I don’t know, but this ridiculous double standard shit is pretty bogus. 
        Now I gotta be ok with my husband gettin’ his knob cobbed on at work 20+ years ago...?
        Fuck outta here bro.
Bill  : Knob... cobbed on?
Comey : *sighs* Yeah it’s what they say these days.
        Knob... *points at his pecker*
Bill  : *eyebrows raised* Wow.
        Had no idea...
Comey : Ms. Clinton... 
        We need to focus here. 
        The presidency...? 
        Trump...? 
        Russians...? 
        All of it spells out some bad news.
Her   : Look, if we’re dealing with this much bad news, then... 
        *waves her hands around* Make some shit up in a press conference, or whatever. 
        George did that basically every day.
Comey : Bush...?
Her   : Yeah. 
        Dude couldn’t tell the truth if his life depended on it.
Comey : Well, we could actually spin this shit around if we do that...
Her   : *stops pouting* Oh really...?
Comey : Yeah, I mean, you’re a senator for Christ sake, if you provided an ORDER for me to NOT 
        arrest you...
        ...I have to comply with that order.
Her   : But then that means you have to do what George did...
Comey : ...yeah.
Her   : So then you’ll look like an idiot too...?
Comey : ...yeah.
Her   : I don’t really want you to look like the type of idiot George constantly looked like... 
        ...I have respect for you.
Comey : Ms. Clinton, it’s my job to make executive decisions at the FBI. 
        We have to respond to orders we are given.
Her   : Obviously. 
        But then that means I’d be exploiting a fuckin’ loophole.
Comey : It’s there for a reason Ms. Clinton, you can either agree for me to arrest you, or... 
Her   : ...not be?
Comey : Right. 
        What would you prefer...? 
        Handcuffs..? 
        Or, me makin’ a god damn fool of myself and the FBI...?
Her   : I don’t really want either one of those things to happen...
SS    : *opens the door* Bill, you good?
Bill  : *lightly waves* 
SS    : What about you Ms. Clinton...?
Her   : I dunno, I don’t think I’m good right now.
SS    : Oh yeah...? What’s goin’ on?
Her   : This guy might have to arrest me...
SS    : Really...? 
        This dude, *points at Comey* right here...?
Her   : Yeah.
SS    : The fuck he will, I’ll fuck him up if he even thinks about doin that...~! 
        *Looks at Comey* Who the fuck do you think you are pal...?
        This is *points* Hillary Rodham Clinton right here.
        I will fuck *points at Comey* you up, pal...!
Comey : Hey, buddy... take it down a notch. 
        We’re on the same side here.
SS    : Not if you think you’re gonna arrest the first lady, fuckface...
        Not on my watch.
Bill  : Hey, Charlie... relax man. 
        I don’t want you gettin’ arrested or hurt.
        These guys are above you in this situation.
SS    : ...they are...?
Bill  : ...yeah.
SS    : Oh... so I could actually get in a lot of trouble for beatin’ this dude up?
Bill  : I’m not sure, it’d come down to whatever the rest of the government thinks...
SS    : Whatever dude, I’ll fuckin’ spend some time in jail if I have to protect the first lady...
Bill  : Charlie, I appreciate how loyal you are pal, but this isn’t the right time or place for that. 
        I’ll be with you soon.
SS    : Alright. *looks at Comey, scoffs* 
        Dude says he’s gonna arrest the first lady... Wow.

        But that’s some fine service right there.
Her   : Damn straight buddy.
Bill  : They can be a little overly aggressive at times...
Comey : I respect that though. 
        Not sure that guy understands that.
Bill  : I’ll let him know when he calms down.
Her   :  Alright, rather than to continue dwelling over whether I FEEL like going to prison...
        I’m gonna save myself and every other American some trouble.

$Book.AddSection(6,"Question (2)",@"
If the question is, at what point can someone important, get in trouble for something they did...?
	
Well, the same question may ALSO be applied for former president George W. Bush, because hey. 
If that dude committed treason, and knew about 9/11 attack AHEAD of time...
...the SECRET SERVICE will protect him regardless. (← SERIOUS PROBLEM, AS OTHERS WILL DO THAT TOO)

At least with Sackler, he knows he’s in deep shit, and lost his nest egg.

On the contrary, suppose you remain within MORAL/ETHICAL boundaries, you might have to break a few eggs 
here and there to make an omelet, but you’ll still be a kickass (former president/rich bastard) if you 
make sure to break as few eggs as possible. So, I begin to consider, what if Elon Musk had a product 
which was deadly, (like putting the cocaine back in the Coca-Cola), well...? 

The feds would’ve DEFINITELY brought his ass into the courtroom, and charged him for something... 
Cause, they’ll shake their heads and just say “I dunno bro... something just didn’t seem right about 
goodie two shoes suddenly having another shade of ETHICS/MORALITY...” 

It’s cause apparently if you’re a fuckin’ evil bastard, then they will... allow it or something.
I dunno man. They seem to like real evil pricks or somethin’... maybe I’m wrong.

Anyway, in Elon’s case, they’d skip the house-visit from the (judge/lawyer/police)... and he’d just go 
right to prison, no trial or anything either, just like Julien Assange, 175 years. 

I dunno why they prefer to give evil bastards a break... 
Why is that the case...? 
Cause some people are actually above the law, since they have enough friends.
So long as they use deadly weapons, lies, misinformation, and stuff like PEGASUS/PHANTOM, 
USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001, PRISM, and etc, they don’t need to follow it at all.

It’s probably not a consistent case at all, and it just APPEARS to be that way.
Some of them probably have NO IDEA how correct I am about capitalists helping government agencies,
help SPECIFIC PEOPLE, remain above the law, as well as assassinate people with disruptive ideas.

So, Elon Musk is a PRIME EXAMPLE, of them being pretty fuckin’ pissed off that he’s had a LOT 
of disruptive ideas and technologies.

As far as Hillary Clinton is concerned, they fuckin’ LOVE this lady.
So much, that SOME of them would jump in front of a bullet for her SECRET SERVICE MEMBERS.
Yeah, her security detail has its own sub-security detail.
Nested security details.

Cause... she’s awesome. She is not fuckin’ totally evil by any means, as far as I know, never 
committed TREASON or anything. But- something doesn’t seem right about Julien Assange’s 
situation, and I think she has some say over that. Because she has friends at Exxon Mobil.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(6,"Domino Theory (1)",@"
She was embarrassed by (Julien Assange/WikiLeaks), which I further discuss in GREAT DETAIL, in…
[Chapter 7 - USA-Patriot Act of 2001 and Surveillance Capitalism]

Instead of running for president, she should have allowed Bernie Sanders to take the spot.
She would’ve done her party a BIG FAVOR, by doing so.

Trump can literally coach a dude on how to grab a woman by her pussy, and then have THAT scandal 
get pushed into the media, and then, THAT MADE NO DENT AT ALL... because when it came time for 
the election, the RUSSIANS HAD HACKED IT. Not just the election, but also FACEBOOK.

I was actually upset about that video with Trump talking to the reporter Mr. Bush, but- if the 
Democratic party didn’t see the WikiLeaks shit BEFORE being released at or about that time, 
THAT IS NOT THEIR FAULT. There’s a reason why that stuff never became public, and that’s 
immoral. It wasn’t so much as an embarrassment for Ms. Clinton, it was an embarrassment to the 
entire party.

That whole clusterfuck caused the dominoes to start toppling each other over, ultimately resulting
in the `$1T donation the American taxpayers freely provided to the Taliban situation in 08/2021.

Maybe Exxon Mobil could’ve paid some of the MILITARY MEMBERS, over in Afghanistan, to PROTECT 
shit that EVERYBODY PAID FOR, instead of pumping Ted Cruz in the asshole some more, and handing 
HIM a real cool `$500M. Ya know...?

Maybe I offended this woman by sticking up for Assange, who also leaked the "Collateral Murder"
video... Julien Assange, is not the fuckin’ problem. Hillary Clinton is ALSO, not the problem.
Trump is not the problem. Biden is not the problem, have they each done somethin’ bad...?

Uh, yeah. But, I’m not trying to FOCUS on MISTAKES that people make, they’re just a pretty 
compelling argument that SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED.

So, I’m gonna return to the topic of morality.

There are the legion of skull-fuckers that actually look out and scavenge the playing field for 
anybody that has a cool idea, or sounds interesting, and they will fuckin’ come right after ya,
because some people lack morals.

$Book.AddSection(6,"Excerpt [~] Starlite",@"
STARLITE is a material that this dude invented that even NASA fuckin’ wanted, REALLY BADLY.
	
The man was a barber or salon stylist, he performed a demonstration of this material that HE 
invented. It was (very thin + lightweight), and had a VERY HIGH RESISTANCE to HEAT. 

His demonstration involved taking a LIT TORCH, HOLDING THE FLAME INCHES AWAY FROM THE EGG, and 
it did NOT cook the inside of that egg after prolonged exposure to this flame.

No other material on earth, can do what this shit was able to do. (Or, I don’t know of it)
The man was TERRIFIED of sharing his formula with ANYBODY, because these idea stealers are 
notorious and they’re fuckin’ VERY REAL alright. 

It stands to reason, that it would’ve made a PERFECT HEAT SHIELD FOR SPACECRAFT RETURNING FROM SPACE.
Quite literally... Elon Musk himself would fuckin’ build a time machine to bring this dude back from
the dead, and pay him billions of dollars for this material. 

Think I’m exaggerating...? I’m not. They could use this amazing material instead of CERAMIC TILES.

Unfortunately, time machines don’t exist. Deloreans might, but not one with a working flux capacitor.

Still, ask Elon Musk if he’d pay BILLIONS OF DOLLARS for it.
He’ll most likely say "Uh, fuck yeah I would."

Dupont probably had something to do with this man not wanting to share the formula, and so he took 
that secret to his grave (supposedly). 

Had that man been able to capitalize on that idea, our current state of affairs with a NUMBER of 
things, may be VERY DIFFERENT.

has some fuckin’ problems. They want people to think that it’s a FREE MARKET, but they will send some 
henchman to STEAL SHIT from people, and become rich off of it... cause they’re immortal.

Not saying that happens in EVERY case, but- I really do think that even:

Guys like Gates have every reason to be concerned about their shit being stolen, I agree.
	
These people that lack morals really are... all over America, AND, everywhere else.
Why...? It’s because society tries to teach people about REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY...
...but most people fuckin’ suck ass at REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY.

If somebody says "Go ahead, fuck my girlfriend, see if I care...", MOST people will fail to 
realize that this is a REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY TEST. 
Go figure.

...most people will be like "Well, alright then, I guess I will..."            (←  MORON)
...few  people will be like "Something seems very IMMORAL/WRONG about that..." (← GENIUS)

Regardless, the people in CONTROL that LIST to guys I just listed... the MASTERS.
They WILL prevent other people from becoming as powerful as either the people I listed, OR, 
as powerful as the MASTERS themselves... by using even MORE devastating REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY.

THEY will watch every god damn thing everybody does, and somehow call that a "free country", 
like America. It didn’t feel like Orwellian 1984 back in the early 2000’s, it felt a lot more 
like the America I’ve always known. But as I started getting older, I began to see these 
EXCEPTIONS where things I observed made no fucking sense, at all.

If I sign up for a FACEBOOK account, does that give Mark Zuckerberg the right to own any 
pictures I upload to the platform...? 

Well, apparently it does. (← DOESN’T MAKE MUCH SENSE, IF AMERICA IS ‘FREE’)
What is ALSO not so forthright, is that FACEBOOK is NOT a public forum.

Users do NOT have the right to post whatever they feel like, as EVERYTHING is graded. 
So, if you post something that goes against some corporation’s (ideals/profit)...? 
That will get blasted into oblivion, AND, portions of a picture will be COVERED, or REDACTED.
MOST PEOPLE DO NOT NOTICE THIS. EVEN IF I SHOW PEOPLE WHAT I MANAGED TO SEE.

and if they want to take your shit...? Or, limit your rights...?

They will. 
They’ll take your shit, and then slap a copyright or patent on it, and then magically they came out 
with a product or service that took your idea. Then, most of the time, people have no fuckin’ clue

The way THEY see what I’m writing about, is that I’m akin to one of the SLAVES for an old

I’m not jealous of either Hannity or Carlson, nor am I envious of them, either.
However, it’s true, they’re pretty rich after all. 
But, what are they really rich for...? Good question.

They probably ARE somewhat intelligent when they’re NOT in front of a Fox News camera.

But, when that camera is rolling...? 
Well, as soon as that Fox News Camera is on the air...?
...these dudes somehow lose a 100 IQ points each, respectively. 

Probably sounds impossible, goin’ from being able to sound rather intelligent and sophisticated...
...and then switching to a fuckin’ barely alive potato. 

I’d be willing to place a bet, that the both of them have an average IQ of about 110-125, 
which means they’re not stupid.
Not bad, mine’s about 160+

Anyway, could’ve been 110-125 for each of em, but as soon as the cameras start rolling...?
...it drops to fuckin’ 10 to 25. 
10 means basically brain dead, 
25 is more equivalent to a tree sloth (probably)

You ever seen a fuckin’ tree sloth...? 
Well, they’re not real “fast” are they...? Nope. 
They have a much slower metabolism than a human or really most other animals, 
but I don’t think that changes anything in reference to their IQ.

When someone is at the hospital, and may have experienced a stroke, or lead poisoning, 
whereby becoming a vegetable...?
Well, their brain activity may be low, 
but- they’ll STILL have an IQ higher than 10 to 25 (that’s probably pushing it).

Somehow, these fucks survive the impossible. 
And, they can somehow talk still, too.
Pretty sure that having an IQ of 10 is actually impossible... probably even 25.
Even a fuckin’ tree sloth is gonna have more brain activity AND higher IQ than you...

The only reason that it sounds impossible, is if people aren’t putting any thought into what I’m saying.
It’s impossible to suddenly lose 100 IQ points when you’re on the air, and then get them BACK when you’re not.

However, I’m not sure how else to describe what I think is actually happening behind the scenes.
Best explanation I can fathom, really.

Some people ACTUALLY think they’re interesting to watch...
Most of the people who watch Carlson do so for a sudden boost of self-esteem.
Most people enjoy watching someone that helps them feel "smarter" then they were before.

Hillary Clinton, is on that list. 
So are comedians. (Comedians specialize in “fictional stories that sound funny”)
Then... there’s an actual fuckin’ cooking show host.
I could have probably added some cartoon characters in there SOMEWHERE...

Then, idk man. 
But, that is what I call the ‘Order of Credibility’

Many of those people are basically tied, by the way.
Obama, is on that list, because he’s a fuckin’ badass. 

He literally had to sit in the Oval office...
...next to a dude who had no fucking political experience whatsoever... 
...who somehow became his successor... 
...and he didn’t flip out.

$Book.AddSection(6,"Shoutout [+] Barack Obama",@"
This dude, deserves some special recognition, actually. 
So, I’m gonna say it right now.
Bill Clinton did a pretty decent job.
Barack Obama, did slightly better.

So what if there was a hot mic nearby when Biden said "This is a big fuckin’ deal, man."...?
Dude just passed the Affordable Care Act "Obamacare", into law.

While there WERE many things that I wasn’t too pleased with that occurred during his presidency...
This dude is the farthest from somebody I would ever truly remain pissed off at.

And yeah, I have said a few negative things about this dude in the past.
I was pretty fuckin’ pissed about Edward Snowden specifically.
Also very pissed about PRISM.
Also very pissed about the bailout checks.

But my god... those issues PALE IN COMPARISON, to just how fucking terrible...
...Donald Trump’s presidency truly was.

I guess when you have a “best” president, who was ALMOST impeached for getting his dick sucked 
in the oval office, and another may have committed treason on 9/11, it’s gonna be pretty difficult 
to fuck that up. But, even still, I would compare his presidency to that of Ronald Reagans, or 
even Jimmy Carter’s. I just, wasn’t (old enough/alive) to witness most of what THEY did.

This dude, had a sense of integrity about him, and a sense of humor.
Then he actually got Osama Bin Laden.
Didn’t ANNOUNCE that he “MIGHT” get Osama Bin Laden.
Didn’t say that he was gonna get Osama Bin Laden BETTER than anyone else EVER (would/could)...
Didn’t really BRAG about it after the fact, either...
Even allowed himself to get get into an actual car, and go get a coffee with Jerry Seinfeld.

Should he have made certain that Osama Bin Laden remained alive for a trial...?
Yeah... I think he should’ve. Then again...? 
I don’t blame the SEALS, for being like “WHOOPS, FUCKIN ACCIDENTALLY SHOT OSAMA... MY BAD BRO...”
But, hey. Eggs. Omelets. Michelle was pretty active as a first lady. 
I think they all TRY to be as involved as Hillary Clinton was, during Bill’s presidency.
Michelle was pretty active.

Obviously this dude did a “good enough” job, for me to think he’s the best one I can think of...
...in recent history, although, Biden is CURRENTLY in a close 2nd place.

That COULD be because Biden was the vice president for this dude.
Basically it is akin to when Al Gore decided to run in 2000, and even though he WON the popular 
vote, fuckin Bush somehow got the electoral college vote victory.

Regardless, when AIG and GM needed some bailout checks...?

Look, when people say stuff like “He’s rich and THAT must mean he’s smart”,

I have a very FIRM understanding of when people say those things, and yet... 
...they remain oblivious to how ignorant they sound...
I just don’t understand why so many people are ignorant enough to say it anyway. 
Even after I tell em.

You CAN be very rich, and still be one of the least intelligent people on the planet.
You can brag about how you upgraded Air Force One...?
Or, how you’re somehow always the (best/only) candidate that people can vote for...
...in a communist country like Russia...
Or, you can tell people that climate change is fake as fuck...

They may be rich...?
But- if they HANDED their money to someone ELSE...? 
...there’s a 99.99999999999999999% chance it’s in better hands.

But that REALLY depends...
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(6,"Intelligence",@"

However, when I think about people where literally ANY person in the world would agree...
“Yeah, that person IS smart”, I think about guys like George Carlin.

Not just a smart bastard, but a critical thinker and philosopher. 
Yeah, this dude knew philosophy up and down.
Most people believe it was just his English skills, and presentation.
Dude was a straight up philosopher.

I would go so far as to say, probably smarter than most of the people in the S&P 500.
But, I don’t know those people. 
Maybe, they’re smart as fuck, too. Who knows.

George Carlin was not a real RICH bastard, however, I don’t think he cared so much about money.
What he DID care about, was being extremely talented at 1) BEING and 2) SOUNDING sophisticated/smart.
And consistently was. I cannot think of a SINGLE EXAMPLE, where this dude just...
...sounded like an oblivious fuckin’ moron, EVER. NOT ONE TIME.

Basically he would go through the 10 commandments and somehow, get em all down to like 2.
While I’m not suggesting religion is total bullshit, the commandments sure do repeat themselves...
Repeating one’s self isn’t a problem so much as trying to break divine concepts down into smaller
pieces, which is what the commandments actually do.

Most people aren’t of a "gifted" category, so people might need things simplified even more, and
thus, repetition accomplishes that. But- it stands to reason that the 10 commandments definitely 
are repetitive after all.

Carlin came across as an atheist, but he also knew what the hell he was talking about, so I’m not 
entirely sure. He probably was disillusioned by how people that call themselves “very religious” 
would make these... MORAL compromises. More often than not, he would make an entire skit about 
politicians or religion, or mix them together.

Now, a lot of comedians don’t really get that deep anymore. 
If anyone comes close, it’s probably Louis CK, maybe even Bill Burr.
As far as I know, he’s not swimming in a whole shitload of money either.
Jay Leno, probably is, and the same goes for Jerry Seinfeld...
I wouldn’t really call Jay Leno the same grade as comedian, because while he is pretty funny, 
...he didn’t do stand-up like Carlin did.

Doesn’t mean that Leno is something to write off.
Leno’s show lasted from premiere: 05/25/92 to 05/29/09
But his material wasn’t in the same category.

Most comedians never become INSANELY rich.
Jerry Seinfeld is probably the largest exception, he is a GREAT comedian,
...and is one of the wealthiest ones out there, but...
...I cannot think of a single example, where anyone’s material dethrones George Carlin’s work.

George had a LOT of deep, mind-numbingly, thought provoking material...

The point is, you can be extremely fucking smart, and it won’t make any impact on how much money 
you have. Some people that were never born with much intelligence, they will try to make sense 
of the following... 

"If TUCKER CARLSON was a complete idiot, then he never would’ve became rich or famous."

There’s a FALLACY in that statement.
Sometimes I have to educate someone, that if I wanted to become rich...?
They should refer to the beginning of the chapter.

The fastest way to do that is to kill someone that has a lot of money, and then take their money.
Of course, that’s a pretty fuckin’ stupid idea. 
Not only is doing so illegal, but there’s a rather (HIGH PROBABILITY/NEAR CERTAINTY)...
...you’ll fail.

Some people will get pretty fuckin’ bent out of shape if you start saying shit like that.
That’s fine, I get it.
But, Carlin talked about a number of these things too.

People that have a lot of money typically expect something like that MIGHT happen...
...so they develop CONTINGENCIES, and they are VERY CAUTIOUS...
...for reasons I’ve already exhibited and explained.

They don’t like to feel threatened or like they have a target on their backs...
...totally understandable.
It’s not gonna stop some people from thinking or strategizing ways to do such a thing anyway.
Perhaps talking about how moronic it is, actually helps them feel better or more safe.

Regardless, that is the fastest method. 
Other than maybe winning a lottery. Or, someone rich hands you a fat stack.

At the end of each manner or method in becoming a rich bastard...
...is having shared opinions with other people. Cause people have to be willing to BUY something...
...so if what they’re BUYING happens to be “well made”, or “fits a profile”, 
...then that is how sales and stocks work.

I don’t really think that people on Wall St. ever have permanent, long-lasting success where...
...they’re just safe, SO safe, that NOTHING is ever that RISKY afterward.
Because, Bear Sterns is a prime example of how volatile (Wall St./NYSE), truly is.

Guy 1 : Hey, you know what would be AMAZING...?
Guy 2 : What...?
Guy 1 : Being able to like, pay people over the internet...
Guy 2 : Like, a pal, or somethin’?
Guy 1 : Yeah, for this Ebay thing, auctioning stuff online.
Guy 2 : payapal.com...?
Guy 1 : Nah, somethin’ shorter than that, but yeh, paying a pal over the internet.
Guy 2 : What if they’re not REALLY your pal, though...?
Guy 1 : Oh well, they’d still sorta be your PAL...
Guy 2 : How about, "Pay Pal"...?
Guy 1 : Dude, that’s perfect.

Then, Musk helped this team of cool bastards funnel billions and trillions...
...through the Ebay Marketplace...
...by building the world’s FIRST pal paying program.

Eventually, the internet started to mature quite a bit, and a couple planes somehow 
destroyed a couple of the world’s largest buildings, and the internet was sorta experiencing
its first bubble... the "dot com bubble"...
However, the internet survived, and then the internet led to social media.

This guy may have done more than just take inspiration from other projects, but-
...that doesn’t mean he wasn’t a large contributor for the internet to become what it is today.

MySpace used to be the thing people used for putting their profile or pictures online.
AOL Instant Messenger, ICQ and IRC used	to be ways that people stayed in contact with one another.
Zuckerberg thought "I could totally merge these things together, and include hot-or-not.com"...
...couldn’t I?

Boom. That’s what he set his sights on. Wasn’t waiting around playing Quake III Arena, cause...
...dude had his mind set on something that could ONLY exist in the future once he was done.

Had to hire the world’s 3rd-99th best software engineers on the planet, cause Microsoft and
Oracle kept the best to themselves. It’s a legacy that continues to today...

They had a lot of ideas that they’ve implemented over the years, and eventually, those ideas 
allowed Zuckerberg to become quite a rich bastard.

Warren Buffet is a major CONSERVATIVE
William Gates, Jeff Bezos, AND Mark Zuckerberg, have always been a mixed bag between-
CONSERVATIVE and RADICAL
but it is safer to say that they are more RADICAL than conservative.
Elon Musk has always been extremely radical in a way that has no historical precedent.

While there’s nothing wrong with being either or...?

What is it, that makes them so different...? 
The safe route which will LEAST LIKELY FAIL, versus the RISKY route which will MOST LIKELY FAIL.

TIME is what changes something RADICAL, into CONSERVATIVE after time goes by.

When Facebook was brand new, it was definitely RADICAL. 
Time has gone by, it’s set an expectation for what can be considered "normal".

Whereas, Elon’s companies all have a theme where he’s creating NEW INDUSTRIES, 
OR innovating unprecedented territory.

Gates and Bezos ALSO did that. 
While I’m not going to discount either one, both of their (ideas/businesses) revolved around 
personal computing, as well as OTHER businesses. 

That’s where a lot of similarities end though... 
Microsoft has been geared more toward engineering the worlds best software, 
and they’ve set the bar impossibly high for anybody else in the industry, to MATCH or EXCEED. 

That’s cause Bill Gates and his partner Paul Allen set it so god damn high, 
starting with the Altair 8800 to whenever Bill said “I’m fuckin’ beat bro...” 
Understandable though. Anybody probably would’ve been exhausted after going from 
Altair BASIC -> to Windows XP

He basically destroyed so many competitors with his buddy. 
Steven Ballmer took over, didn’t do a terrible job really, 
...I think he just had some luck issues.

I will say this. 
Bill Gates may not actually be at Microsoft, but the guys in his company...?
They will occasionally ALLOW Google to FEEL like it may someday have a shot at being 
in 2nd place, in terms of where the world’s best software engineering takes place. 
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(6,"Microsoft - World’s 1st place Software Engineering",@"
This is how they do it. They will literally ask the owner of Oracle, Larry Ellison to go take 
a nap or a break or something... He’ll say “Alright, fine.”

That’s when the magic happens. Google’s software engineering "place" switches from 3rd place...
...to 2nd place. Then, when Ellison comes back...? Well, fuck... Google gets knocked back down 
to 3rd place material again.

That’s Bill Gate’s legacy right there... 
The company is still very active, throws elbows ‘n shit...
...has a motto "No nonsense allowed".

I might get on Jeff’s case sometimes with a light insult or two, but... he didn’t build Amazon 
by himself. McKenzie helped with that immensely, and so did that board room full of geniuses.
He had a team of REAL smart bastards helpin’ him out...

When it comes to describing the level of ingenuity that Silicon Valley has thrown at the fuckin’ 
whole entire world...? To say that Redmond and Seattle, remain a cut ABOVE Silicon Valley, that’s 
not a joke. Microsoft does one side, provides the operating systems, intellectual property to start 
moving 0’s, and 1’s (assembly), and Amazon just polishes the presentation and the package, and 
tells UPS, FedEx, where to go. 

They also both have a pretty strong hold over cloud computing. 
There’s really not a direct competitor to these (2) companies.

That’s why Gates and Bezos happen to appear very similar to Gates and Allen. 
They’re not something to be joked about... but I will still occasionally say that Jeff is a bit 
short sighted, in reference... to Elon Musk.

Elon has been spreading the seeds of his many ideas in parallel to one another, and I think much of 
what caused him to be so unconventional, is the theory of simulations and base reality. 
His story seems to be a combination of Simulation and simulacra, The Matrix, and 1984. 
But- sort of the same story.

$Book.AddSection(6,"Programmers",@"
ALL of these guys, Buffet, Zuckerberg, Gates, Bezos, and Musk... 
...guess what they really do have in common above all else...? 

They’re all fuckin’ programmers. 
Buffet isn’t a KEYBOARD or COMPUTER programmer, he’s a FINANCIAL programmer. 
I’m not certain that Bezos does programming <anymore>, but- I’m fairly sure that he does. 
Regardless, all of them have successful companies and have programmed a way to success.

In reference to Musk, he’s.. basically in a race by himself now. 
To read all of the positive things that I just said and then say “a guy is now in a race by himself...” 
...is sort of not fair. 

Because... they all fuckin’ worked their asses off to get where they are. 
But- Elon Musk has set a new precedent. 

I don’t think he has a “free security team” that wakes him up with a newspaper, coffee, 
and breakfast... the dude will literally sleep in his office and fuckin’ remain there stressed 
the fuck out until he feels like some challenge has been completed. 

Doesn’t matter how fuckin’ rich somebody is, that period of time, STILL FEELS LIKE HELL.

But his hard work is paying off, regardless.

His ideas revolved around (physical objects/machines) that involve a lot of complex engineering, 
and typically revolve around the idea of making things cost less, more environmentally friendly, 
or have to do specifically with capturing, storing and distributing renewable energy. 

He was really multitasking that whole time after starting Tesla with his buddies that had a fuckin’ 
wicked good idea for an electric car, and then he had a meeting with the Russians to buy a rocket 
that they wanted too much money for, and he literally said to himself

Nobody, that’s who stopped him.
Some people sure as hell TRIED... 

Though he’s done plenty of other things, he has been kinda dribbling 5 basketballs at the same 
time, while walking down the street. Multitasking is basically what he’s been pretty fuckin’ 
skilled at. All while Bob Lutz and the rest of the political landscape had to judge and critique 
his every fuckin’ move... 

Am I sayin’ he’s perfect...? 
Nah. 
He probably takes a shit sometimes... 
Whether that’s a literal shit, or a metaphorical one, I’m sure that not every idea pans out.

As far as Tesla goes, it’s difficult to say for sure whether Tesla has more impact than SpaceX, because I don’t 
think the success of either one would’ve panned out without a that first successful 4th Falcon launch. 
I don’t know though.

The reason why the car industry has ALWAYS been difficult for new contenders, is because the car 
industry eats contenders alive, and always has. But, there might be an ulterior motive for that, 
rather than just quality or standards... 

Might be guys like Bob Lutz taking a shit in his pants, and betting against Tesla out of sheer pride.
AT LEAST, ya know, Elon Musks’ “bad ideas” are still a lot COOLER than any of Bob Lutz’ bad ideas…

Sending Starman into space in a fuckin’ Tesla Roadster... is literally, the coolest way that anyone ever gave a

$Book.AddSection(6,"Complacency",@"
America has a theme of laziness, but a less offensive way to state it is complacency.
Maybe it’s also because of ignorance, or a less offensive way to state it is creativity.

I’m saying all these terms at the same time because the way they sound, illuminates a spectrum...

When an American employer has immigrants with their H1B’s come here with their work visas, 
to work in Silicon Valley or where ever to promote somebody’s bottom line... they’re taking 
opportunities away from their own countrymen. 

They’re willing to spend less money on foreign talent, or people with better grades... rather than 
to invest in their own country. Cutting costs somewhere reduces some quality of something somewhere, 
but then the cream that floats to the top gets scraped off regardless. If that cream was prorated 
or expected to be there, and it ISN’T, then either the integrity or quality of the product, company, 
or service needs to be shifted around somehow to remain consistent... but that’s not CONSISTENCY.

In other words, once the bankroll starts pouring in, they like to know that there’s a predictable 
pattern of something harvested. If things change, they will change everything around THAT... 
...cause that’s how the stock market works. 
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(6,"Talent",@"
There might be more talent in America than overseas...
...and it seems like society doesn’t think a lot about that.

What they may ALSO overlook, is that some of these people might come here, and then... 
...they see some real fucked up shit goin’ on here, so they... say “HOLY FUCK BRO”, and that’s 
when they decide to follow the example someone else left for them to take inspiration from... 
...and so they start to send DATA back to other people in their home country... 
...so that they can have these silos of identity thieves that read a script.
One that their buddy in America wrote. 

Yeah, I really hope people understand that’s definitely goin’ on for sure... 
Anyway, they followed the example left for them to do so, and so THEY sent a shitload of cash back to 
people in their home country, to build a business that can exploit people in (America/where ever)
in the same way that their employer exploits people too... 

But- THOSE people are ALSO victims too, and guys like Jim Browning may have their work cut out for 
them if he wants to focus on THEM... However, there are far worse offenders out there like Cerberos 
and APT29. They’re fuckin’ deadly. 

Not saying that’s a consistent thing either, but... PLAUSIBLE being the key word.

Whereas, hiring talent from within the country, that scenario is a lot less likely to happen, AND, 
if someone were to try and do that, WELL, then the police would DEFINITELY be able to put a fuckin’ 
stop to that, wouldn’t they? Cause then it’d be WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION. 
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(6,"Precedent",@"
The thing is, the examples people set for others, IS pretty important. 
If Ted Cruz accepts bribery from Exxon Mobil but has to keep the dick in his ass a secret, he’s not 
really setting a good example for other people to follow, other than if you keep your mouth shut, 
then no one will see it happening. 

That’s fuckin’ moronic, a lot of people see that shit in his bank account, watch Before the Flood.
If he doesn’t swear, oh well... he’s considered more “trustworthy” than basically someone with a 
mouth like me, cause I swear and draw up colorful analogies... 

So what...? 
That dude might be a senator, but he’s committing illegal activities and isn’t the only fuckin’ one 
either. So, what if the police didn’t enforce ANY laws because if SOME laws can be ignored, why not 
ALL of them? 

Regardless, the example that guys like him set is that immigrants who come here, remembering how so 
many people in their home country starved every day, or got sick and died, then in their eyes, 
committing identity theft is probably the lesser of two evils. That’s why guys like Chuck Schumer 
are a better role model. He’s not doin’ that shit. Or if he is, it doesn’t make any fuckin’ sense 
when I see him on advertisements trying to get my attention. He looks like he’s trying to follow 
RULES and shit.

At the end of the day, guys like Ted Cruz will look for an easy way to get as close as they can, to 
the billionaires... but they allow some of their integrity to be erased when they do that. 
Yeah, being a senator isn’t supposed to mean “give a middle finger to climate change”, 
nor “lets ignore these shooting sprees by blaming individuals”, 
because the answer to gun control, is to let it remain the way it is... 
...and focus on repairing society as a whole, as it all comes down to MORALITY and MENTAL HEALTH.

It most certainly is society as a whole. Because … guys like Ted Cruz are a fuckin’ problem that’s 
not being addressed at all.

Yeah, what I’m saying is that, for every Ted Cruz allowing Exxon Mobil to fuckin’ pay him `$500 
million dollars, there’s 19 kids and 2 teachers that will get shot to death because Ted Cruz wasn’t 
actually going around being an active member of his community like he’s fucking VOTED INTO OFFICE

a flying fuck how much money he has, or Hannity has, or Carlson has... Nobody really gives a shit 
about how much they have. Wanna know why...?

Cause some people work their asses off and get next to nothing, and they’re content. 
Why...? Cause they have a purpose.
Guys like Elon, are no different. 
He might be a successful bastard, but he’s not trying to fuckin’ take bribery money nor commit 
crimes and corrupt the system in his wake, so that he can have a nice villa somewhere in wine 
country, appearing to be such an upright model fuckin’ citizen. 

Yeah. Sucks when I have to put it into words...
Ted Cruz, doesn’t swear or anything, goes on TV a lot, but has the behavior that’s fuckin’... 
IT IS CRIMINAL AND NOBODY DOES A FUCKIN’ THING ABOUT THAT CRIME. 

Unless I’m wrong, and accepting bribery from Exxon Mobil isn’t a fuckin’ crime, well, huh. 
I have read a god damn dictionary in my day...

America prides itself on innovation, right?
While it’s pretty difficult to identify specific individuals who promote these themes, society as

...in reference to every electric vehicle GM made when he ran it.

America prides itself on being innovative, yet has problems when it comes to: 
disruptive technologies and advancements.
Why...? 
Well, maybe the easy answer is to say greediness and laziness. 
The hard answer may be that new ideas are challenging and they often fail.

But, even when new ideas are REALLY SOLID, sometimes there will be a capitalist that takes em out.
Disruption is actually a VERY good thing. Schools teach kids NOT to be disruptive.
Depends on the type of disruption though.

I realize Warren worked his ass off and was considerate of other people’s feelings, and didn’t like

Mr. Gates wasn’t ALWAYS playing the safe game, however. 
The safe game, is where you don’t do anything to upset ANYBODY.
So your opinion is never fully stated out loud, therefore, you won’t know if an idea of yours 
upsets some other person.

“If you have nothing nice to say, then don’t say anything at all.” (← PROBLEM)

Yeah, maybe you don’t tell everybody in the neighborhood that they’re a real asshole for leaving 
their fuckin’ trashcans knocked over all the time... I don’t think anyone stands to gain anything 
from that though, probably isn’t their fault.

But at the same time, if someone’s leaving their dog outside in the cold, it’s probably worth 
telling the neighbor that’s a pretty shitty thing to do bro...

Thing is, not everybody is gonna think much of bits and pieces of the red flags that occurred 
BEFORE these mass shooting massacres... but afterward, it’ll make a lot of sense to some people...

“Kid kept fuckin’ posting shit on Discord. Thought he was just fuckin’ around or somethin...” 
Nah, but we as a society should consider erasing that logic somehow. 
Anyway, not exactly a side point, but that’s not the focus right now.

Elon, never thought much about the safe game, and when he came up with a killer ideas, 
nourished it... and then smacked a fuckin’ grand slam each and every time. Well, can’t say EVERY

until within the last couple years or so.

For a while, Jeff Bezos was the richest guy in the world. Unstoppable. Unable to be beaten.

However, if there IS anything to take away from all of the shifting around of pole positions, 
and leaderboard... the only constant is change.

Yeah, playing the safe game isn’t RISKY, because... 
there’s very little probability that your idea or strategy isn’t gonna be like Ted Cruz’ asshole, 
...getting stretched out real good, or eviscerated.

Destroyed.
Ted might like that scenario... but then again, might not.
He sure as hell likes the pay day though, doesn’t he?

$Book.AddSection(6,"Consideration",@"
Nah, everybody’s gotta share this fear or belief that someone that sounds crazy probably is...
Cause, they’re probably upsetting somebody that’s popular and well liked.
Meanwhile, someone smarter than they are, is gonna call that popular person out for being a moron.
All of the popular kids will gather around the courtyard and start chanting "fight fight fight".

Then the popular kid gets his ass kicked. Why...? 
Someone had a better idea. Fucked him up too.
Elon’s success is representative of that.
I’m not making a literal comparison there either, but it is a good analogy. 

When people try to tell me ‘if you were so smart, you’d be rich by now’, there are other factors 
to consider. So like, morons will think intelligence is why people get rich, but what happened to 
Aaron Swartz? Aaron Swartz was more involved in programming and was smarter than Mark Zuckerberg...
Mark might even AGREE with me on that, too.

Aaron got himself mixed up with the feds, and he was ill-prepared to take them head on.
Mainly because some douchebag used the USA-Patriot Act of 2001, to be a little gay kid that thought 
to prosecute Aaron, instead of pulling the dildo out of his asshole. Such a complex sentence I just 
wrote... 

The Electronic Crimes Division, doesn’t fight identity theft or cybercrime even though someone 
should... and caused Aaron Swartz to hang himself. Not a noteworthy accomplishment at all.

If you force people into a position where they have no fucking options... they will probably do 
that. That’s what happened to people like Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington, Robin Williams, need 
I go on? These guys weren’t ACTUALLY confined like Aaron was, because they had a decent amount of 
fame, and money... but there was still something very wrong, and they felt that their life was void 
of PURPOSE. All of those guys were intelligent too, but that doesn’t resolve a sense of PURPOSE.

Because, other factors that aren’t based around intelligence would include:
    (1) being considerate of the popular kids or the conventional ideas (oil/car companies)
    (2) being respectable and caring about other people’s feelings 
    (3) knowing the ‘right’ people
    (4) having the ‘right’ opportunities

Ask any rich bastard out there, "Did you become rich because of your intelligence...?"
An honest one will say "Well, there were other factors."
But, if they say "Yep." 
They’re lying.

Sean Hannity became rich because he knows how to suck RUPERT MURDOCKs dick, so long as he keeps 
fuckin sayin’ that climate change is MADE UP, DOESN’T EXIST, then Hannity’s gonna be cobbin’ on 
that dude’s knob. Had nothing to do with his intelligence.

The point is, the people who try to exhibit that logic, to someone who has to write logic all 
the time...? Someone such as myself has to stop that moron in their tracks, and let them know 
how stupid they sound.

$Book.AddSection(6,"Opinions",@"
If they try to say "that’s just your opinion"...
Or, "It’s a good thing the world doesn’t run on opinions."

Yeah, the world DOES run on OPINIONS, actually.
Also, tell them that OPINIONS load weapons sometimes.

Ask any GENERAL → SOLDIER in *any* military.
Or, any law enforcement officer.
Or, any person in the government.

OPINIONS are pretty important, so if someone tries to discount YOURS...?
It’s probably important to let them know, that your OPINION is still pretty important...
...because then you can discount theirs in response.

If your OPINION happens to ALSO be a FACT, then that may be grounds for some condition...
...where you can state "Well, do you know the definition to the word, FACT...?"

Cause I still remember what this dude said to me at Saratoga County Family Court...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

The sentence repeats itself in my mind sometimes, just a casually obtuse way for him to discount
my opinion that was ALSO a FACT.

It is difficult to have a response for statements like HIS, without some advanced knowledge, 
because that statement can definitely be considered WEAPONIZED PSYCHOLOGY.

WEAPONIZED PSYCHOLOGY falls under PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION, but it is more difficult to 
have a response for it, if you’re not expecting it. Unless you have some way to shoot them down 
AHEAD of time, then you’ll always be operating on someone’s PERSONALITY rather than PRINCIPLE.

I’ll return to that point later.

Again, the world DOES run on OPINIONS, actually.
Even the MILITARY is driven by OPINIONS.

I am intentionally being obtuse there, to make a point.

People weren’t ignoring me, they thought to talk to other people because they DID hear me.
Because the way that our society was brought up, is that RESPECT is a ONE WAY STREET.
But it isn’t, cause... (← RESPECT IS A TWO-WAY-STREET →)

The problem is that some people will try to casually play it off like my OPINION doesn’t matter.
If I notice that people are working REALLY hard to pretend like they DON’T hear me...
...it is worth considering insulting people.

Not for a ridiculous unwarranted reason, but as a matter of COMMANDING RESPECT.
When people respect what I have to say, I have no reason to use any of those techniques.
Everyone SHOULD adopt these ideologies, because there’s too many people who think that...
(RESPECT IS A ONE-WAY-STREET →)

I’m not the smartest person in the world. Never said I was.
If I expect to be a PROFESSOR, I have to consider that people are listening, after all.
I don’t TRULY believe that everyone drowns my opinion or rhetoric out...? 
But sometimes it does frustrate me when I’m not getting feedback or validation.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(6,"Offensive",@"

It is pretty offensive, to discover that I WAS being heard, and then, someone chose to take 
action regarding an OPINION that I indicated, but- without telling ME.

For instance... I took a bunch of pictures of the Verizon fiber optic cable infractions
all around Clifton Park in May 2020. Then, people from Verizon heard what I’d said, and they 
went ahead and fixed those infractions without telling me. FIOS still not available.

^ This is INCREDIBLY OFFENSIVE

Some people actually use that to manipulate others. 
They like the idea of pretending like they didn’t hear you, because, to them...? 
Your input is not important... otherwise, they would’ve said *something* 
So if they took ACTION on your input, and didn’t tell you...?
It actually means that YOUR INPUT was important... but, YOU weren’t. (← OFFENSIVE)

That isn’t always the case, though.
If someone’s listening and is considering your OPINION, or learned something from it, 
they will more than likely make it pretty OBVIOUS that they have some level of RESPECT for you,
though it may not be IMMEDIATE. 

However... discovering that Verizon went ahead and fixed the fiber optic cable infractions that 
I took pictures of, while the FBI was preventing some of my pictures from getting into my Google 
Drive account...? That’s fucking HIGHLY OFFENSIVE.

Because that tells me that someone thinks I’m a PRODUCT. 
Who knows though, ya know? 

I don’t think cattle farmers ever have to worry about a COW, deciding to kick the shit out of 
the cattle owner... But when humans do this to each other...? 
They should be worried about that, because they might get themselves punched in the face at some 
point, for making that mistake. 

The solution is, maybe they should stop treating OTHER PEOPLE like a PRODUCT.

Cause a Big Mac, isn’t something to consider a POTENTIAL THREAT
But a PERSON who finds out that they were LIED TO, that’s definitely a POTENTIAL THREAT

$Book.AddSection(6,"Elaborate",@"
Now, suppose they had their own thought out OPINIONS/IDEAS, they would respond or comment.
That means they will ELABORATE on what they are thinking.

I put quite an emphasis on what I write or say, and am aware that I do make it pretty difficult 
for people to ELABORATE their OPINION. It has nothing to do with being social, it has everything 
to do with someone putting some thought into it.

Sometimes I might get somebody who thinks that the popular kid in school was always more 
important, and THEREFORE, correct.
So, that’s when you have to introduce them to the flawed sense of logic they have.

In reference to the opinion I had about Ukraine being invaded, VLADIMIR PUTIN thought it’d be 
cool. And, that it’d be easy. And, his people would be supportive and not have a problem with 
this military operation... and then this idiot didn’t realize how much money he would cost the 
entire country and how quickly his progress would be shunted to a halt.

That’s because Putin didn’t expect another 175K javelin missile makin’ it’s way into another 
`$5M tank that he sent, (4-6) of their soldiers now dead, compound that by like... IDK.

I don’t have raw numbers or anything, but Putin has lost a lot of fucking money and so has 
his country. That’s what happens when a country starts being seen as a "pariah". 

Even Mitt Romney saw this shit ahead of time, perhaps about a decade ago.
I think Mitt Romney has caught a lot of flak in his day, but- there’s always a chance that 
he could stand to run for president again, and possibly win.

The point is, this entire chapter was all about "If you were so smart, you’d be rich by now",
but at the end of the day...? Even IF you became rich because you were smart...? 

You can STILL stand to lose ALL of it, by making (1) incredibly moronic mistake...
Or, MANY moronic mistakes in succession. 

The bottom like is that the statement does not hold true... 
"If you were smart, you would be rich by now." (← FALSE ASSUMPTION)

Ryan has made it clear to me that he is part of a larger collective.
He is directly involved with the (2) guys who attempted to kill me on May 26th, 2020, and has also made it clear 
to me, that he has killed a lot of people. He has access to equipment and software that can exploit any mobile 
device in the world, as well as any computer on the world. 

On the way there, I had a few ideas floating around about how in the future, the law enforcement and justice 
system will be replaced by something better. Yeh, it’s called “Cortana”. Basically, this whole process over 
the last (2) years has taught me that nobody has rights anymore. 

That’s it. 
Game over, bro. 
Nobody has rights, 
Might as well, crawl under a rock... 
...and stay there...
...might not be that bad, after you get used to living under a rock.

We all have rights and stuff, but you have to consider putting them in “air quotes”, 
because the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001 is basically overriding the Constitution cause IDK, 
some fuckin’ morons passed a law into law, WAY too fast.

Suppose the best way to really get back at anybody, is just to bang the snot out of their girlfriend or wife...
Just, cause her vagina to violently orgasm, and spray everywhere, and if she says “HOLY SHIT, I DIDN’T EVEN KNOW I 
COULD DO THAT...” It isn’t unconstitutional to do that... It’s encouraged, actually.

Now, I don’t really fuckin’ know how to put it... there are obviously some very useful attributes
to the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001, but there are also people exploiting it...

Exclusion basically means that whether there is something in between 0 and 1, you round it all right back down to 0.
But- when patterns show a pretty clear indication of certain people with the MOST COMPELLING motive,
that’s when pressure will inevitably cause those people to reveal themselves. Which is exactly what Ryan did.

So, when getting himself CAUGHT, he’s gonna fuckin’ piss him off. Because he’s probably goin’ to prison.
To say BOTH of these IDENTIFIED THREATS are DANGEROUS, is foolhardy, they’re more than DANGEROUS.

Imagine if people’s cell phones could use something like that to find someone, or like 911 dispatch operators 
could find somebody that has called 911 in this manner.

Oh wait, they can and DO that already. Huh.

So, it’s really OK for THESE GUYS that are WAY ABOVE SHAEMUS AND MICHAEL ZURLO... to commit ANY CRIME they 
feel like... Even if the cops are right there...?

They didn’t see that... Nah, they saw Michael C. Cook Sr. flying out into the middle of the road that magically had 
a few stab wounds in his backside... left a pool of blood on the OTHER side of the road AFTER he landed on the side 
of the road he was found on, cause what the actual fuck.

“That idiot OBVIOUSLY did that shit to himself...” -SCSO Cooper (← Indicates a MORON, fooling other MORONS)

In no scenario where REALISM occurs, does a human CORPSE leave a pool of blood on ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD, and then,
magically FLY to the other fucking side of the road, and THEN die. But, that's how stupid some people at SCSO and
the New York State Troopers actually are. They don't care about this term called “EVIDENCE”, they PREFER to use
what's called “MANUFACTURERED EVIDENCE”, or “FRAMED EVIDENCE”, which means it's not LEGITIMATE EVIDENCE AT ALL.

However, the police organizations don't particularly give a flying fuck about whether evidence THEY manufacture
or frame, is legitimate or not. When I say they don't give a shit...? That's *EXACTLY* what I mean.

The SOONER they can MANUFACTURE/FRAME evidence to get a particular person in trouble...? The better.
That's how they get most of their paychecks. They gotta eat SOMEHOW, right...?
What better way than to kill or frame innocent people...?

It's basically NO DIFFERENT THAN ACTUAL MURDER. 
DEREK CHAUVIN is a prime example of how the police can't just KILL people as often as they please.
Some people really are stupid, and they think that if a police officer breaks the law...? Then that means it's legal.
Nah. It doesn't mean that at all. But, SOME PEOPLE REALLY ARE THAT FUCKIN DUMB.

Whereas, even if they were RIGHT in the middle of preventing my 911 calls from reaching the dispatch station,
AND, I managed to pull those knives out of THEIR hands and stab THEM to death in SELF DEFENSE...?
Well, that means that I HAD someone chasing me that had knives in their hands, and I should’ve just given
them a handshake and said, “Now you guys aren’t gonna try to kill me again, right?” 
Cause now I can trust anything they’ll say. If they say “Sorry, we’ll never do that again...”
Well, that’s just what most people will do. Not even joking about that PART really.
Like, if some dude comes home and sees his wife getting fucked by someone that’s not him...
“Oh, my bad bro. I won’t do that again. I promise.”

Now you know that they promised you, and you’re good, now. She said it. Promises...
Nah all of those things are ridiculous, but that is what police are doing alongside these serial killers.
They saw the entire event. Or at least, Scott Schelling had some type of audio feed or tap to my device, OR,
was in <DIRECT COMMUNICATION> with someone that filled him in... that is why he was the FIRST TO THE SCENE.
 
They will see it. Aw. SCSO doesn’t really have an edge anymore.

It helps to have a nice security team that’s watchin’ my back, so if the cops didn’t see the two guys 
carrying knives that were about to stab me... cool. They almost stabbed me, and then magically the backs of 
their heads got blown off. Aw. 
“I had nothin’ to do with THAT, officer, I swear...” 
“Sorta LOOKED like a couple cocksuckers needed to be shot to death...”
“But- I have NO IDEA where those bullets would’ve come from...”                               (← Don’t go this route) 
^ They’re expecting people to react this way.

Whereas, THIS will SCARE THE SHIT out of them for SURE...                       (← even the serial killer assistants)
Consider the details in the prior (2) examples.
I was able to successfully convince a MILITIA to provide black ops against suspected organizations like SCSO.
This militia consists of either CURRENT or FORMER: US Military, CIA, FBI, NSA, SEALS, Secret Service, etc.

“Yeah. This kid is definitely correct... Time to lock and load.” -MILITIA <unspecified>

So, even if someone was preventing my 911 calls from reaching the dispatch station...
...they didn’t realize they were ENSNARED within a black ops operation.

Hidden government isn’t going to see that coming... So...
Then, even though I was in a trap that they thought they set for me, I managed to pull those knives 
out of my attackers hands, and then MAYBE I stab THEM to death in self defense...?         (← Nonpeaceful Resolution)
OR, maybe the MILITIA was able to DERIVE INTENT, and then stand up.

That’s when these serial killers realize that 20 soldiers all wearing camouflage and government issued weapons
pointed at them... Ah man. Now they know what that means...

...they’re gettin’ fucked in the “POOOOPER” in prison for the rest of their life.    (← gay, but Peaceful Resolution)

BUT- it won’t just be those serial killers... It will ALSO be the police officers that were actively watching.
The ones that expected I might be able to pull the knives out of these serial killers hands...
...to kill those serial killers.

Cause, at the very moment that any officer was seen OBSERVING this event, they had their radio jammed.
Then, their vehicle turned itself off.
Then, they’re using the radio, saying “Dispatch... can anybody read me...?”
Then, they use their PERSONAL MOBILE DEVICE to contact KNOWN ASSOCIATES. (Like many of the guys in SCSO do)
Then, AFTER they get out of their vehicle...?
...the vehicle turns itself back on and locks that officer out of (his/her) vehicle.
Now, the lights turn on and blare the sirens.
Ah... now we know who was in that vehicle.
They may as well kiss that badge and their freedom goodbye... cause they’re getting’ hauled to prison.
For ATTEMPTING TO FACILITATE A MURDER, but other terms may be applied, like ESPIONAGE ACT OF 1917.
Ah... now here’s the thing. If any of this stuff hits the NEWS however, it won’t be real helpful because then,
*shakes head* then you’re really gonna cause people that weren’t worried about ever being caught...
...and they’re gonna start to be a lot less likely to do this shit.

The reality will begin to sink in, that the Constitution of the United States of America, has enough information
written in it to get Julien Assange released from prison, even if that prison is in Britain/England, the queen will 
have to be told to “Shut the fuck up, bitch. Step aside.” 

Because, it was found with ADAMANT CERTAINTY, that England was doing this. All laws, departments of government, 
officials, lawyers, police officers, military personnel, they took offense to when they found out that a 
country hid the bullshit tea and forced America to still pay for it anyway... into the fabric of our society.

And that’s when an act of war was declared against the queen.
Then, because Britain is outnumbered, outmatched, and outgunned in every way...
...they surrendered. Then, Julien Assange was released, and all current inmates in every prison in AMERICA and 
BRITAIN, were offered an opportunity to convince their prison guards, that they were victimized somehow.

Then, Edward Snowden was formally discharged and exonerated for the charges that the 
Department of Homeland Security filed against him for the Snowden leak.
Bradley/Chelsea Manning had his charges relinquished.
Thomas Drake had his charges relinquished.
George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Michael Hayden, and a number of other unspecified people, they may swap places 
with these guys... and then the Secret Service will be disbanded and replaced by a different operative.

Cause the Secret Service and Exxon Mobil, were directly linked to the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001.

I’m getting CARRIED AWAY with the SCOPE of this situation for a reason.
Michael Zurlo  → will be entertained by this story regardless of his involvement or non-involvement.
Craig Apple    → will be entertained by this story.
Julien Assange → will be entertained by this story.
Edward Snowden → will be entertained by this story.
Cause literally, none of these people were able to make the same CORRELATION.

...that militia had been able to DERIVE INTENT of those by-standing officers watching the event unfold.

That’s why developing something as ridiculous as “a protective shield of armor made from quantum energy”,
called Cortana, will exist at some point. The idea isn’t ridiculous at all, it’s science fiction that may
ONE DAY, be a REALITY. And when you begin to talk about stuff like that... you will become a target.

The above certainly makes for a better story than trying to scare the shit out of people cause threats were 
being lobbed around aimlessly... cause what these serial killers WANT PEOPLE TO SAY/DO, are as follows:

SCSO suddenly had several officers (that were assisting the serial killers) go missing, including their vehicles. 
The militia couldn’t stand the sight of seeing these guys do this to their own fellow citizens.
The serial killers were immediately executed by the MILITIA.
The police officers that were facilitating these murders, they were also immediately executed by the MILITIA.
Then their vehicles were brought to a special scrap yard by the MILITIA...
...and then their bodies were each thrown into the foundation of a new house that Bruce Tanski had his 
contractors build. Or, maybe Eric Catricala’s concrete foundation. (I’m kidding about all that.)

Pretty sure that concrete foundations can be examined with a tool that can see a skeleton inside of it.
Whether it is X-Ray based, or uses a seismic graph of some sort, or wave form, it’s fuckin’ possible.

Bruce Tanski and Eric Catricala just took the song by Drowning Pool, “Bodies”, a little too literally.
“Let the bodies hit the floor”... so hard they fuckin’ somehow got mixed into the liquid slurry.

Just, bodies everywhere you could even possibly think. 
In every concrete foundation that they were involved with building.
More bodies than concrete. Nobody understood, how SO MANY BODIES weren’t even SEEN that whole time, wow~!
Don’t worry how someone’s vehicle gets to Mannheim, either... Those vehicles were “repossessed” alright.

These bodies actually caused cracks in the foundation and spread to the sheetrock interiors of each of 
those buildings. A body being thrown into a concrete foundation is a bad idea if you want it to be solid, and,
not contain evidence of a crime having happened at some prior point in history.

They decided to follow this dude in his ideology, and they left SCHELLING alive...
...so he could get a nice fat brick in his asshole. He screamed like quite a bitch man...
Eventually Scott admitted how/why he did what he did. 
Then, he was brought to a special jail, one that’s WAY more secure than Guantanamo Bay.
Because, people were allowed to get a fair trial or file appeals. They were never once ignored OR delayed.

The kid who’s mommy and daddy bought him this lethal program “Pegasus”, looks exactly like he did on the 
video I recorded on May 25th, 2020... Sounds like him too.
This dude, sounded like he was in total agony... cause he had an even FATTER brick in his asshole.
Even Christina Czaikowski fuckin’ felt bad for him “Aw. Poor kid... bricks aren’t supposed to go there.”
Even the superintendent of Shenendehowa, Oliver Robinson said, “Holy FUCK, dude...”
Everybody did. Because they had no idea that whole time that this was happening.

At the end of the day... nobody wants a FAT BRICK to be shoved in and out of their asshole, over and over, right?
But- apparently this kid didn’t understand that at all, when he killed a lot of people with a variety of tools...
...he never thought to shove a brick in anybody... just knives. Sometimes the little sai’s, or some blade.
You have to consider how painful it is to be stabbed to death, by a sharp object, in order to justify shoving 
an actual brick, in this dudes asshole, over and over... and just wait till he can tolerate it.

Not only should people STOP BEING INDIFFERENT to the notion that SOMEONE has been watching EVERYBODY...
...but they should also consider that the reason these people do it, is to watch what they do, on their devices...
...so that they can steal intellectual property, valuables, or secrets.

Mommy and daddy couldn’t bail this kid out... oh nos. Here's what happened the next day:

Now, here’s the bright side. 
None of that shit in scenario 2, 3 or 4... will likely happen within the next few days, or weeks.
Maybe months...? Or years...? Who knows...? Maybe it'll start TODAY. Or, tomorrow. You never really know.

This might all just be fictional, and never happen, but at the same time, it really COULD happen if that's what 
they're found to be doing... And this SHOULD scare the shit out of EVERY corrupt police officer that reads this.

Scenario 1 will continue to happen on schedule, because that is what SCSO are experts at doing.
Scenario 1 makes no fuckin’ sense, but sometimes Captain Cooper has to swoop right in, and deposit falsehoods.
Then he will tell anyone within earshot “It does make sense, pools of blood can eject themselves all the way to
the other side of the road in some instances...”
And then everybody just fucks off. 

Then again, maybe some of them will look at each other with a puzzled look on their faces, thinking...
“This dude sounds like he’s... fuckin’ losin’ it, doesn’t he?”

Scenario 2 will RARELY happen. 
Scenario 3,4 will likely not happen anytime soon, cause even if thousands of people, or even millions of people 
read that, people might have a real difficult time wrapping their head around whether it’s FICTION/NON-FICTION. 
But, most people will ASSUME that it’s fuckin’ fiction alright, and then they will NOT care if it’s true or it 
happens. 

Because, who gives a shit if serial killers are out there, or if another 30 kids die in a school... 
...like Uvalde Texas.                                                                                (← Manipulative)
I fuckin’ just rattled off what they’re actually doing, and it’ll be too difficult to believe.
However- there are some fictional elements thrown into a NON-FICTIONAL story.

There is a HIDDEN GOVERNMENT in the United States of America that operates on people’s ASSUMPTIONS.
Franklin knew these fucks would never give up.
Which sucks because I’m about a quarter Irish/English.
They are basically the BRITISH MONARCHY. I believe the BRITISH MONARCHY held President George W. Bush...
...hostage, right...?
And forced him to APPEAR as if, he committed an act of treason on 9/11/2001.

Now, here is what I mean specifically.
The USA-PATRIOT ACT of 2001, allows the hidden government to be in control.
They are basically the same exact thing as Hydra, in … The Avengers/Captain America
They are extremely dangerous.
They know how to shape people’s expectations AND, cleverly disguise elements of surprise. 
But, I don’t think it’s a persistent individual or group.

Writing this document, and facing what I knew back on May 26th, 2020, I know what I am up against.
I could show people evidence and proof of them doing things that any normal person would overlook, 
but I’ve caught every single time they’ve been doing something, or were ABOUT to.

I’m pretty sure I have a fuckin’ guardian angel after all, man... Benjamin Franklin.

They have been basically attacking the United States since fuckin’ 1812. They never gave up.
For THEM to take out VLADIMIR PUTIN on his BEST day, would be like a walk through the park for these fucks.
Vlad isn’t somebody to take as a joke either, he’s ALSO deadly.

They (HIDDEN GOVERNMENT) dispatched a couple of normal-lookin’ dudes, who APPEAR to be civilians.
I believe they were the ones who attacked my device before 01/15/19, AND, then again on 05/26/20. 
I know someone on their team works for the Saratoga County Sheriff Office.
The man was watching me on 06/16/20 @ 2200ish on Route 9. 

Then, they also tried to get me on Fathers Day 06/20/20 ~ 1 mi. away from New Salem.

These guys they’ve sent, each time. I get a feeling that it’s them.
The kids that I recorded on video, I’m less afraid of than the... 
I’ve (had premonitions/seen visions) of this motherfuckers face, and it terrifies me.
He’s the god damn Boogey man.
The police have no idea they exist.

THEY have corrupted America from TOP → BOTTOM
Not hard for somebody to do when they slip in these nearly UNABLE TO DETECT/SLICK things like, “Apple having 
an integrated battery in smartphones”.

Oh cool. Dublin. 
Now, you can’t openly state that it is LITERALLY the BRITISH MONARCHY that is causing all of this corruption, 
but it is fuckin’ god damn close, dude.

I think this group of people, they’re terrified of me as well.
Because I seem to know every time they try to make a move.

It is because I have SOME sense of telepathy, AKA “a sixth sense”, or INTUITION.
Everybody has this, but most people choose to ignore it.

Because Ted Cruz gets away with bribery, and everyone’s just ok with that.

Right now, this is just a document being written by a guy. However, I’m damn certain that some people have an
Achilles heel and the problem has a very easy solution all across the board. I literally stated above, that I 
stood up for the head sheriff of Uvalde, because I knew those dudes were terrified to bust into that classroom. 
Not their fault, there’s new developments since it occurred, but there’s a solution that isn’t being considered.

Ted Cruz, could’ve been on top of something like that. But wasn’t. Wanna know why...? 

Cause he was getting drilled between the ass cheeks by Exxon Mobil for fuckin’ `$500M. 
Exxon Mobil is sorta the reason why WTC 7 collapsed on 9/11.
And, oh, the other (2) buildings too. And, (4) planes being involved in the attack. 
I’ll go over this shortly.

At some point, a lot of people are going to think “THAT IS FUCKED UP BRO...” No shit.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(7,"Militia Cont'd",@"
Continuing from the very last point about the Militia, written in [Chapter 1 – Liars in the Lead]...

That doesn’t mean that THE MILITIA doesn’t have to POINT THEIR WEAPONS AT THEM ANYWAY... They do. And, will.
And then ESCORT THE PERSON COMMITTING THAT CRIME TO JAIL. 
But then ALSO, HOLD A GUN TO THAT PERSONS HEAD SO THE POLICE DON’T LET THAT CRIMINAL OUT OF JAIL. 

Because the police may actually attempt to let that politician that you know was committing a crime, out of jail. 
Sorta like a cat trying to get out of the house... Man. God damn cat got out again... (← Analogy). 
If a police officer attempts to let that politician who was committing a crime out of jail, FIRE A WARNING SHOT.

They will probably NOT appreciate that at all, and they will NOT wanna die for that cocksucker either...
So if they have any sense, they’ll just fuck off at that point.
Then, CONTINUE TO POINT THEIR WEAPON AT THE ACCUSED, UNTIL AN INDIFFERENT JUDGE PROVIDES THEM WITH A TRIAL. 

Then, DURING THE TRIAL KEEP POINTING THE WEAPON AT THE INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS COMMITTING THAT CRIME SO THEY DONT 
FLEE, until... they are SENTENCED TO A PRISON TERM, which is part of the LAWS THEY GET PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO 
WRITE. 

So, something like BRIBERY can be 3-5 YEARS IN PRISON, or RACKETEERING can be like 5-10 YEARS IN PRISON, or 
EXTORTION can be like 3-5 YEARS IN PRISON, and that person BECOMES A FELON FOR LIFE, and then...
...they CAN’T BE A POLITICIAN ANYMORE, as that's typically a CAREER ENDING SITUATION.

Whereas a crime such as CENSORSHIP, can actually be considered TREASON under certain conditions. 
Then, an act of TREASON can lead to a sentence such as THE DEATH PENALTY. 

Can’t be a politician after that, either.

So, if I’m a colonist, and then some asshole from Britain expects me to pay for the tea, but the tea sucks ass... 
I can tell them to fuck off. Right...? Well, I’ll tell ya, if everybody else pays for the fuckin’ tea, and you
don’t... then what happens is that everybody will take the shit when they can tell this dude to fuck off instead. 

Modern equivalent, GUYS LIKE JAMES COMEY LET HILLARY CLINTON OFF OF THE HOOK FOR COMMITTING A MAJOR CRIMINAL 
OFFENSE. Whereas GUYS LIKE JULIEN ASSANGE GET 175 YEARS FOR BASICALLY DOING THE SAME FUCKING THING SHE DID. 

Or, `$1T of US Military weapons, ammunition, bombs, vehicles, equipment, etc. Every American taxpayer FREELY 
DONATED ALL OF THAT `$1T TO THE TALIBAN. 

Ultimately what that means is, things over the last 20 years could’ve been SLIGHTLY CHEAPER, and it would’ve 
offset the INFLATION that we are CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING. 
But also, THE TALIBAN WOULDN’T BE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT BECAUSE THEY COMMANDEERED OUR SHIT.

So, maybe people really should consider telling the bill collectors or the British with their shit tea, to 
fuck off. I’ll explain more throughout the rest of the document.

Some people won’t find that shit funny at all... that means they don’t have a sense of humor and it’s been 
thrown into oblivion. It should cause people to laugh profusely, because Ted probably does like getting fucked 
in the ass by Exxon Mobil for `$500M. 
Do you get `$500M for letting some oil company fuck YOU in the ass? No? 

Alright then, you should be offended by HIM getting `$500M rather than MY analogy.
NO ONE in the HISTORY of anybody... has ever paid paid `$500M, to get fucked in the ass.
Or, maybe some people have, and I’m just fuckin’ clueless... 
I mean (1 person, 1 ass fuck) = `$500M
I’M SURE A LOT MORE PEOPLE WOULD DO IT … RIGHT...?

I mean, lets be realistic here... Even if Elon Musk was asked, “Hey, would you ever pay somebody `$500M for a 
single ass fuck, like ya know, Ted Cruz...?”
He would probably start negotiating it down A LOT, OR, upgrade the FREQUENCY/QUANTITY.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(7,"Skit [~] Negotiation",@"
Musk : So, what you’re saying, is that Ted Cruz gets a REAL COOL `$500M to allow Exxon Mobil-
Me   : ...to fuck him in the ass.
Musk : *chuckles* Jeez, I guess I’m in the wrong industry...
Me   : I know, right...?
       Look...
       Would YOU...

Musk : Sounds pretty steep if you ask me.
Me   : *tilts head slightly* I know, trust me, I’m aware of how steep it is.
       But- this is Exxon Mobil we’re talkin’ about here...
       They basically pay him that each time, probably.
Musk : I could practically build 2 or 3 Starships with that... (← I don’t know that)
       Doesn’t really sound like a good-
Me   : ...deal, huh?
Musk : *chuckles* Nah.
Me   : Alright. 
       We’re on the same page, just in case you were wondering.
Musk : Alright.
Me   : What is, in your estimation, either the minimum number of (AAF/allowable ass fucks) for that `$500M...?
       Or, the maximum amount you’d EVER pay for a single ass fucking.
Musk : *pauses* I would probably have to do some math on that, because... I really don’t know.
Me   : ME EITHER MAN.
       I know a lot of people that would do it for free~!
Musk : I was gonna say that, but I mean... depends on who it is, frankly...
Me   : Aha~! 
       That’s just it, right there.
       Depends on WHO the person is.
Musk : Not for nothin, but I could see myself paying someone more-
Me   : ...attractive than Ted Cruz, right...?
Musk : You took the words right out of my mouth.

$Book.AddSection(7,"Identification (2)",@"
Make sense yet? 
 
However, some people will actually laugh uncontrollably when they read it... 
And if someone is going to use something that makes people laugh...?
It better not be something BAD about them...
But, pretty sure that Elon Musk, won’t take offense to that.
Ted Cruz will. Oh well.

Cause then Ted won’t even let people see it...
Facebook does that... unless it’s about something vague or nondescript...
...or, it’s a meme of somebody that’s not powerful enough to control it.

Well, Ted Cruz will probably think its funny that I made a document that he’s probably gonna take some notes 
from... ...just keep readin’ buddy.

As for the “Skit : Hannity givin Murdock some dome”, several chapters up, some of them will find it funny, 
RUPERT MURDOCK will probably laugh when he reads this, because he says the same exact shit that I say. 
He’s probably thinking "...I do talk to Sean like that... like, word for word..."

But, people like Ted Cruz telling people how many times Exxon Mobil has thrown a dick in his butt...
...would probably be embarrassing for the man, so why admit that at all...?
So, he doesn’t. And, that’s ok. 
There’s no law obligating the man to have integrity, or state his AAF-to-payment ratio.

I used to think laws like that existed, but they don’t!
Because if they DID, someone would ENFORCE those laws, correct...?

Well, think again fuckface. 
Those laws DO exist. Do the lawmen ever give a shit...?
No. Cause the law men do what James Comey did for Hillary Clinton. Free pass. 
The law men are either 1) lazy, 2) ignorant, or 3) corrupt.
I will combine all of them into just calling them morons.

Whether it’s:

... Ted Cruz telling everybody about the BDSM relationship he’s has with Exxon Mobil... 

... Bob Lutz admitting that he shit his pants every single day around 1045AM when he worked at General Motors 
for about 50 years, spending that entire time ALMOST successfully making (1) single good vehicle that WASN’T a 
piece of shit, millions of times, and then using `$3B of that bailout money from Obama to buy so many new pants 
and underwear, that he could comfortably shit his pants every day for the rest of his life without fear or
judgement...

... Sean Hannity scraping the fromunda cheese off of RUPERT MURDOCKs nutsack with his tongue (sometimes with 
his teeth I’ll bet), right before he goes in front of the camera...

... TUCKER CARLSON talking shit about somebody’s golf skills.
Tucker spent months talking some serious shit about Bob Lutz SO many times, and then FINALLY, Bob Lutz stopped 
pretending like he didn’t hear this fuckin’ dude. Bob got pissed off enough to accept a match...

Then, Tucker does what he always does... 
For `$500, Tucker will pay his buddy who NEVER LOSES a game of golf, to play that game.	

Tucker never has the intention of being the person, who plays the game.
He’s probably never even lifted a single golf club in his entire life, and that’s fine.

Doesn’t stop him from talking a lot of shit about people’s golf skills.
He knows, it’s a game that powerful white dudes will play when they think they own some shit...
...or think they’re important, or whatever.

He uses that, to manipulate EVERY single one of em.

So does Rupert Murdoch, actually.
That’s who taught him how to do this.

Tucker isn’t the same type of dude Sean Hannity is, nah.
Hannity is a tool. So is Ted Cruz. 
Whereas, Tucker is a mass manipulator.

$Book.AddSection(7,"Identification (3)",@"

While Tucker will (SAY/DO) questionable shit that proves what a moron he is...
...the idea of cobbin’ on another mans knob, like Hannity does to Murdock...
...OR spreading his ass cheeks for anybody at Exxon Mobil like Ted Cruz...
...well, that’s crossin’ the fuckin’ line for TUCKER CARLSON.

I’m actually grateful that he has a line like that, after all.

I know that he’d lie about doing such a thing, because he will lie about ANYTHING.
But I ALSO know that TUCKER CARLSON wouldn’t be caught dead...
...with some dude’s dick in his mouth, or asshole. 

Same goes for Bob Lutz, actually.
Bob might shit his pants a lot, but- that doesn’t make him any less of a man.
Bob, tried to make Elon Musk look like a fool, but that shit totally backfired.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Musk heard that, and he thought to himself: “Oh, I’ll show you SOMETHIN’ even BETTER, dude...”
Then Musk does what he does best, and told Lutz to fuck off without having to say those words...

February 2018 I believe, Starman, in the drivers seat of the first electric vehicle ever sent into space...
GM never tried that idea. 
They were never like “Hey NASA, can you help us send a corvette into space...?”

Some guys like Ted Cruz and Sean Hannity jump back and forth:
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
| saying they’re NOT cocksuckers | being cocksuckers | taking a break cause their fuckin’ jaw hurts |_______________
| applying ointment cause their asshole is pretty chafed up | denying all of that shit | listening to Celine Dione |

Look, the point is, they all have somethin’ fucked up about them, that they don’t care to admit.
In Musk’s case, his worst offense is basically, sometimes he swears.
OooOooOOOhhhhHHHhh, richest guy in the world sometimes occasionally swears. 

Some people will be like “WOW, I’m extremely offended by that... what kind of example is he setting for others?”
Uh, PEOPLE DO ACTUALLY THINK THAT.
They don’t think about the things the OTHER guys are doin’...

SOME of those things are a LOT worse than others.
If you’re like Sean Hannity, you really only have (2) options realistically, do you:
_____________________________________________________________
| suck RUPERT MURDOCK’s dick some more | leave the industry |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Because those are the ONLY options Sean Hannity has.
Realistically, if Rupert Murdoch told Sean Hannity that he’s gotta tell people the truth...
...so that Rupert Murdoch doesn’t come across as the type of dude...
...who would ever cob on another man’s knob...?

Well, Sean Hannity will do that if he wants to keep getting a paycheck. So will Ted Cruz. 
That’s just how America works, and I REALLY don’t think people understand the gravity of what I’m saying.

That is when they will violate my right to privacy, and ask someone they’ve bribed, to keep some eyes on me.

And, if I even THINK about distributing a document where I supposedly have constitutional rights...? 
I’ll probably get myself arrested SOMEHOW, right? Yeah... believe it or not, that is what the police do to me. 
That’s what the law enforcement and justice system do. 

If I tell the police or the lawyers, doctors, or judges...? 

Most of them aren’t WILLING nor ABLE to understand what I’m saying.
Though, in SOME cases, they are/do.

That's why it’s WICKED EASY for me to CONFUSE a lot of them, because... 
...typically these people AREN'T as INTELLIGENT as I am. And, they don't NEED to be.
Because of that, they can just ASSUME that I’m insane...
...instead of realizing that they're mislabeling me, AND abusing their authority.

INTELLIGENCE = INSANITY in some cases. That’s not what it is, but SO MANY PEOPLE cannot DISCERN the difference.
(1) Much in the same manner to how a mentally challenged person may not understand the punchline of a joke...?
(2) Normal intelligence people don’t understand my rhetoric.

So, unless the joke is explained to a mentally challenged person in scenario (1), 
OR, my rhetoric is explained to a normal intelligence person in scenario (2)...
...they just won’t get it. 

They won’t get it because I’m gonna come right out and say it... I’m a fuckin’ genius.
A lot of people really aren’t very bright.

That would include the people I just specified. 
Some of them are NOT VERY BRIGHT. 
When I say that I mean, dumbasses. Morons.

Then they’ll ask a federal investigator friend of theirs to abuse the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001, to see what I’m 
doing every day. So that they can get an advanced preview of anything else I might have to say later on. They 
may watch what I’m doing to try and force me to get in trouble for something moronic, all because I wrote this 
thing that embarrassed the fuckin’ daylights out of all of em. Or, they may just grab a bag of popcorn and watch 
for fun. Either way, they’re gonna catch on at some point.

Nobody will put 2 + 2 together, that I have every right to draft and distribute this document, but I will get 
censored anyway regardless. And if I try my damndest to distribute it, it will get stopped SOMEHOW, and I 
might actually get in trouble. Why...? Because America is a CONTRADICTION. And, a fucking lie. If it isn’t... 
then what might happen, is that I’ll have a following of people that read it, and they will piss their fuckin’ 
pants laughing about it.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(7,"Counter-Manipulation (1)",@"
Why...? Because anyone who’s NOT an idiot, they’ll say to themselves:

"Wow, I really could see Sean Hannity choking on RUPERT MURDOCKs dick, for like `$100M a year." 
...cause it makes a lot more sense than getting paid for his ratings or intelligence.

Or even “Wow, I could see how Ted Cruz probably DOES like when Exxon Mobil fucks him in the ass without lube..."
...cause it makes a lot more sense than him somehow being a good senator who cares about climate change.

Or even "Wow, I could see Bob Lutz shitting his pants every day for 50 years straight when he ran General
Motors..." ...cause it makes a lot more sense than General Motors having any integrity or making quality 
(parts/vehicles).

Or even "Wow, I could totally see TUCKER CARLSON talking a bunch of shit about somebody’s golf game, and then having 
some other dude play..." ...cause it makes perfect sense that he is the type of person who would do all of those
things in that story.

Cause it was a metaphor for his every single appearance on Fox News

They’ve been playing the low-burn, sly-as-hell game, where, as long as they SLOWLY rick roll people...? 
Then, that’s fine. They can stand to be seen with a dick in their mouth at *any* given moment...
...because most people probably won’t notice it, not even exaggerating at all...
...whether it’s a police officer, FBI director, former president, billionaire, lawyer, doctor, judge...
...all of these people can stand to be seen with a dick in their mouth because MOST people won’t notice it.

The reason why MOST people won’t notice it, is because they’re CONSTANTLY DISTRACTED. 
Why are people CONSTANTLY DISTRACTED...? 
Because people like TUCKER CARLSON just drone on and on and on...
...and cause his viewers to develop like a "callous" around their brain.

Causing them to pay no fuckin’ attention to details. 
A lot of people don’t know WHAT to think, so they put the TV on, and they’ll just listen to this fuckin’ dude...
...he knows how to inject his body language, shape his rhetoric to be one sided and manipulative...
...and it does genuinely sound more interesting than C-SPAN any day of the week, but...
...only if C-SPAN is covering something that isn’t really newsworthy.

Otherwise, C-SPAN covering something important IS a lot more interesting than anything this dude says.

Why...? Frances Haugen, says "Facebook has some serious problems internally"
Weird. Wanna know why...? A billionaire doesn’t do his own programming anymore, and would rather have people 
on his platform get censored by lazy-dicked douchebags at the STATE level.

And, they agreed. Andrew Cuomo IS a cocksucker. 
But, they can’t allow me to express myself with the first amendment of the...

Mainly because, Facebook can limit YOUR rights while it sells YOUR data to company’s like Cambridge Analytica.

The reason why that all sounds fuckin’ stupid, it most certainly is. However, it’s accurate.
A billionaire who is literally the same age as me, has some serious fuckin’ priority issues.
He’s probably why America feels a LOT more a communist country lately, than ever in our history.
Surveillance Capitalism, it’s basically the same thing as George Orwell’s book 1984.

So, not only are people getting skull-fucked on the internet AND over the media, but they’re also getting 
skull-fucked by people that have a lot of money, and no fear of being executed. 
When I say something like that, nobody’s makin’ threats...

Just know this, if someone with a lot of money and power has nothing to be afraid of, they will continue to: 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
| manipulate/hurt people | commit intellectual property theft/insider trading | commit corporate/regular espionage |
| steal money, property, documents (wills, deeds, pictures) or estate |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
...if that is how they became rich. Those people really don’t know how to make money without doing all that.

Then, the police won’t ever arrest that rich bastard who’s COMMITTING CRIMES, nor do they SUSPECT them either.

So, to put it BLUNTLY, even if you: 
- show the police a picture of a billionaire standing over a dead body with a knife in his hand...?
The police will actually think what they’re looking at is impossible.
Then, they will STILL not do anything about that...
...cause the police will realize that dude is a powerful motherfucker and they’re scared shitless.

Hence, why someone like me has to write a god damn book.

So, if some rich kid wants to be a fuckface, he can. But if someone says that motherfucker probably deserves 
to be executed, OH WOW someone will probably take grave offense to that. Right? 
Right...
Reprogramming society is gonna take some really tough words, otherwise, events like: 
Buffalo, NY or Uvalde, TX, 
...MANY MORE OF THOSE EVENTS ARE BOUND TO HAPPEN.

The thing about the ‘fear of being executed’, is that it’s supposed to cause some people to stop being a 
fucking demonic fuckface, right...? But- they get comfortable when they have so much money and control, that 
they can throw a literal stack of cash at someone, to get that person to shut the fuck up.

Most people can be SHOWN the truth, and they’ll fuckin’… just treat it like an elephant in the room.
Almost like when someone rips one of the nastiest farts anyone ever smelled, and the person who did the fart,
...they don’t even flinch really...
...cause, THEIR farts smell AWESOME, and yours DON’T...
...their shit doesn’t stink, and yours does.
They have it down to a science, that people are just too fuckin’ oblivious to catch on.

In reference to Murdock, this man has so much money, he can THROW A WHOLE STACK OF IT AT ANYONE, and that idiot 
will do whatever they’re told. So if it’s a federal investigator that is supposed to arrest people in the 
government that accept bribery, well...

The reason they didn’t get around to it YET, is because they’re filling their anal cavity *right now*...
Too busy doing that, they can’t do it fast enough I’m afraid. 
Maybe that’s not what they’re doing at all, but it seems PLAUSIBLE to me.

As for Murdock going around haphazardly injuring people with a taped up stack of cash that he’ll throw at 
anybody. I’m not hyperbolizing that at all, Murdock could INJURE people, with the HEAVY ASS STACKS OF CASH 
HE HAS. The point being, if RUPERT MURDOCK wants to get somebody’s fuckin’ attention...? 

He will PAY someone STRONG enough, to THROW that stack of money, at any person at all.
Murdock having someone throw a large enough stack of cash at somebody, NOBODY IS GONNA IGNORE THAT.

Whether it’s James Comey, or Christopher Wray, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Andrew Cuomo, Michael Zurlo, 
Eric Catricala, Bruce Tanski, or whoever the fuck he feels like.

If that person says “Oh, but that’s immoral, Rupert...”
RUPERT MURDOCK will tell that person: “Shut the fuck up, and do what I say.”

Then, they’ll look at the stack of cash, and do it… rather than to say "This is wrong". Why...?
Because individuals, when they are shown a lot of money...?
They suddenly forget who the fuck they are. Or were. 
Or, what sexuality they used to be. 
Or, lines they’d never cross, somehow being crossed quite a lot afterward.
They may even go so far as to kill innocent people.

Dwayne Coonradt would never suck a guys dick in his fuckin’ life.
Not unless RUPERT MURDOCK had someone throw a fuckin’ stack of cash at him, and told him to do just that.
THEN, Dwayne Coonradt would GLADLY get on his knees, and suck whoever’s dick he was told to.

I’m gonna spend this entire document RIPPING THROUGH this concept, because of how often people say these things.

(^ The answer is that <I’m a LOT more intelligent than the average person is>)
I hope I’ve exhibited that so far in this book, because quite frankly...?
When the most EDUCATED DUDE IN TOWN, continues to pretend like he didn't hear what I fuckin said, over and over...
I have to assume that it's time to write up a fuckin book to make someone that was SEEN as the most educated dude
in town, was in fact, less intelligent than I am.

Otherwise, my situation wouldn't have REQUIRED ME TO WRITE A FUCKIN' BOOK ABOUT WHAT I KNOW.

If I make an observation or a statement, I don’t say it for a foolish fuckin’ reason.
Unless I’m OBVIOUSLY joking around. 
Sometimes, PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE I'M JOKING. 
ALSO, SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE I'M FUCKING SERIOUS.

However...? Sometimes the people that are supposed to take me seriously...? 
They fuckin’ don’t. And that means, they’re gonna get blasted in this document, and they will realize...
...oh, they fuckin’ sorely underestimated my ass, that’s for sure.

-----

The reason why RARE things happen to ME, is because... 
...I’ve made many observations I will cover in this document. 
Also, many of my observations AREN’T RARE AT ALL.
It’s a matter of ME, being able to slice through the bullshit IMMEDIATELY, and when I notice something that 
other people do NOT notice, THAT IS WHAT MAKES (MY OBSERVATION/ME) RARE.
                            -------------------------------------------

Everything I’ve said so far... makes me a threat to CERTAIN PEOPLE.
CENSORING me, allows them to CONTINUE being in CONTROL, but it’s an act of TREASON under CERTAIN CONDITIONS.
TREASON, is SUPPOSED to be punishable by: DEATH.
That means, when a PERSON is found to have been GUILTY of committing TREASON,
…against a FELLOW CITIZEN of the United States of America...
…that is SUPPOSEDLY grounds to be EXECUTED via a MILITARY FIRING SQUAD, with EXTREME PREJUDICE
…SUPPOSEDLY…

Now, the military NEVER DOES THIS, but supposedly, they would EXECUTE someone COMMITTING TREASON with 
SO much PREJUDICE, that even BILLIONAIRES who caused the ENTIRE SYSTEM to be CORRUPTED... 
…who think they’re fuckin’ slick… 
…would be TERRIFIED of such a thing.
    
Even, former presidents whose actions would cause Theodore Roosevelt himself, to roll in his fucking grave.

But, if nobody enforces those LAWS THAT EXIST, then someone with a lot of MONEY can just OVERRIDE PEOPLES 
RIGHTS. Happens every fucking day, and that's why sometimes you have to WRITE SOME MATERIAL before people start
LOADING THEIR WEAPONS WITH AMMUNITION, with the SOLE INTENTION OF KEEPING THEIR TRIGGER FINGER OVER THEIR LOADED 
WEAPONS, AIMED AT A SPECIFIC TARGET, READY TO FIRE AT ANY FUCKING MOMENT.

-----

The thing is, the intelligent ones among them will fear those words, but the ones that aren’t as intelligent, 
they will actively and aggressively fuck with me after I distribute this document, just because they can. 

Those people don't have the ability to see themselves being randomly shot to death because they kept playing 
games with other people's lives. Nah. That's because being in control of so many people's lives causes them
to develop a CALLOUS around their BRAIN area. 

They thought people like ME, were THEIR PROPERTY... 
BUT- as far as I know...? 
Treating other people as PROPERTY is a FUCKING STUPID IDEA. 

Wanna know why...? 
Well, a COW is considered PROPERTY or a PRODUCT... but a COW cannot load a weapon like a RIFLE, nor GATHER 
INTELLIGENCE, nor RECRUIT OTHERS IN THE MILITARY, nor SHOOT ITS OWNER IN THE HEAD with those weapons, ya know...?
A cow cannot do any of those things, but PEOPLE CERTAINLY FUCKING CAN.

That's why treating people as a PRODUCT or PROPERTY is fucking STUPID.

They’re not worried about that in the least, because they’ll manipulate people and commit treason anyway.
The USA-PATRIOT Act allows them to do this without putting any thought into it.

Still, the reason why they SHOULD be worried about these things...
...is ONLY if they would serve to uproot justice and etc.
So if people AREN’T doing all that shit, they really have nothing to fuckin’ worry about. 
So if people say that reading this document caused them extreme fear...
…they don’t realize that’s an indication of how fuckin’ stupid they are.
…they would only be afraid of what I wrote, if they were ACTIVELY DOING THESE THINGS…
…if they’re actively DOING those things…
…they COULD actually be found guilty of committing treason…
…that is the reason why this document terrifies some people, because…
…they’ve been committing treason without really putting any thought to it, since:

Basically, this (law/document) allows CERTAIN PEOPLE to COMMIT TREASON against (a) fellow citizen(s).

Here’s the thing, when I write these documents, differences are being resolved peacefully.
If someone worked so very hard to prevent distribution of this document, 
    ...it’s cause that person is either GREEDY, OR, <unspecified>.
They don’t understand that it’s 1) or 2) the other.
Stop being fuckin’ greedy... 
Or, get caught being too greedy, and <unspecified>.

Censorship, is SUPPOSED to be illegal, but it happens every fucking day. 
When it can be PROVEN... and the lawmen don’t actually do anything about THAT... 
Well, then you have to remind them of what happened in 1776. 
Basically, people should worry about our country falling into a state of martial law. 
Because then it’s legal to <unspecified>.

All the while, SO MANY PEOPLE are just totally aloof and they think... 
Moron: I don’t think he would ever do that though, he seems like a good guy.

Yeah. That’s why it’s important to be able to tell someone, RUPERT MURDOCK is just a metaphor here.
Anyone with enough money can throw some money at somebody, they’ll fuckin feel it. Why? 
Cause the dude has so much money that he likes to spend some just to fuck with people.

When I say ‘fuck with people’, what I mean is, this dude has successfully convinced so many people, that 
TUCKER CARLSON and Sean Hannity get paid over `$100M per year, cause they’re intelligent, or because they have 
the best ratings on the network.
Well... Think again. 
They get paid that much for a WAY cooler reason than that.

The way cooler reason is because some oil/car/gas companies have their dick in a lot of peoples asses in the 
federal government. But it’s also because of the HIDDEN GOVERNMENT. They can’t help the dick-in-the-ass 
situation they’re in... so they’ve gotten used to it, it doesn’t really bother them all that much, anymore.

As for Fox News, Hannity and Carlson...? They DO have good ratings, but is the CONTENT that good? No.

The people in the federal government, have been watchin’ me for my whole life, and everybody elses...
...but something atrocious happened to the way our government USED to work, prior to 9/11...
...and they have been avoiding telling people like the plague.

Some of them get paid to sit there, like JOE MANCHIN, looking like he’s an awesome dude. 
When in reality, THAT dude was never HALF the politician that CHUCK SCHUMER (is/always has been). 
I’m sure SCHUMER will wonder why the hell I’m complimenting HIM. 

The truth is, CHUCK SCHUMER is a role-model politician. THAT dude knows what the fuck he’s doing, and 
he’s not being a lame, limp-dick douchebag that has an OBVIOUS AGENDA, to line certain (company/people)’s 
pockets with money. Not saying he doesn’t bother doing that at all to some degree (they ALL do). 

But, he doesn’t make it as OBVIOUS as JOE MANCHIN.
“OooOOOoooHHhhHhh the fuckin’ infrastructure/student loan bill is just WAY TOO HIGH...” -JOE MANCHIN
^ That’s because Joe has these student loan companies hand up his ass, moving his mouth like a puppet.

Guys like Ted Cruz, they know what they’re DOING, and it’s called BRIBERY. 
They show up, they say shit, it doesn’t need to be accurate, that means he’s COOL...
...and then he just fucks off to go get fucked in the ass some more by Exxon Mobil... 
...even though that dude isn’t actually gay.
(^ I’m pretty fuckin’ sure that CHUCK SCHUMER, wouldn’t be caught dead doing that at all.)

Weird right...? 
A guy like Ted Cruz (senator from Texas), isn’t even gay, but for a cool `$500M from Exxon Mobil...?
...he will ‘go through the motions’.

There are plenty of other people just like Ted Cruz, that I haven’t even mentioned, but they don’t
take it even REMOTELY as far as Ted god damn Cruz does.
Marco Rubio is on the list, but he stays relatively low-key these days.

$Book.AddSection(7,"Skit [~] Ted Cruz (Part 1)",@"
The problem is, Ted Cruz will literally be embarrassed by my single comment, that he’ll say:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Cruz : Oh yeah buddy...? 
       You’re gonna tell people I like getting fucked in the ass by my buddies at Exxon Mobil...?
Me   : I dunno, maybe you don’t even LIKE it. 
       It’s not like you’re an idiot, you’re a shill with no integrity. 
       Big difference.
Cruz : Well, I’m confused cause you just sort of complimented me by saying I’m no idiot. 
Me   : Right. 
Cruz : So... you’re just using a poetic way to call me a shill...? 
Me   : I am saying that you’re no idiot...
       ...but that could be because you genuinely like having Exxon Mobil spread your ass cheeks apart...
       ...so they can shove a monstrously veiny dick in your asshole... 
       ...OR... 
       ...you just have no integrity and you’ve been bribed.
Cruz : Heh. 
       That’s illegal, if I was bribed I would’ve gotten in trouble for it by now.                  (← FALLACY ALERT)
Me   : Na, not at all. 
       The police are actually 1) ignorant, 2) lazy, 3) not very thorough, 4) slow, and 5) very dishonest.
       Sometimes I meet a few that don’t fit any of these categories at all, but they’re VERY RARE.
       Consistently, too.
       I don’t really understand WHY. 
       Unless I start to think about how some of them are BRIBED as well.
       You’d be amazed, some of them really are unable to think that hard about situations like yours... 
       ...especially when they’re bribed too.
Cruz : The police are professionals... 
       ...they would’ve arrested me by now if they found something worthy.                          (← FALLACY ALERT)
Me   : All of these things coming out of your mouth are called FALLACIES
       The word FALLACY means that you are using logic that isn’t COMPLETE, so it has HOLES in it.
                -------            --------------------------------------------------------------
       The word FALLACY also looks like the Latin word for PENIS, that word being PHALLUS.
       So, when YOU say these phrases with incomplete logic…
       …and then I say that you SOUND like you have a dick in your mouth?
       It’s accurate.
Cruz : Why haven’t I been arrested for committing bribery then, huh?
Me   : Maybe the police that are supposed to...? 
       They don’t mind being fucked in the ass by Exxon Mobil either... 
       I don’t know Ted.
       But, your responses are attempting to manipulate me…
       …by exerting some "DOUBTFUL" impression, that these things are likely…
       However, RUPERT MURDOCK probably has control over you like a little puppet. 
       Or Exxon Mobil does.
       They have a special relationship.
       And they also have control over Christopher Wray, so… 
       …if the police try to arrest someone like you…
       …Christopher Wray will have to do the same thing that James Comey did…
       …in reference to the raid on Hillary Clinton’s residence.
Cruz : What’d Comey and Clinton do...?
Me   : They knew that she did something illegal that could’ve led to her prosecution and incarceration...
       ...and they gave her a free pass.
Cruz : No they didn’t...
Me   : Uh, yeah they did, fuckface. 
       James Comey was ORDERED to fuck off…
       …Ms. Clinton didn’t FEEL like being bothered with terms like "criminal investigation" or "arrest warrant"…
       …especially if she’s gonna run for president against Donald Trump. 
       Yeah, so, James Comey, there will be billions of additional James Comey’s… 
       …ones that have a job to do, who are given conflicting instructions, and because of the confusion...
       ...the only thing that a guy like him can do, is turn around, drop his drawers... 
       ...and let Hillary Clinton whip out a real big dildo, and jam it up that mans asshole.
Cruz : *sour face* Jeez. 
       So, Hillary just...
Me   : Got away with it? 
       Yeh. 
       Prolly a 15-incher from what I imagine...
       Fuckin’ HUGE, huh?
Cruz : *sour face* Jeez. 
       That’s gotta be really RARE though...                                                        (← FALLACY ALERT)
Me   : It isn’t. 
       Guys like James Comey do that a lot. 
       If something looks tough...? 
       Oh well. 
       Time to drop your drawers, turn around, and let that person shove something huge in your asshole.
       Sounds fucked up, doesn’t it...?
Cruz : I don’t think that the FBI lets EVERYBODY get away...
Me   : Nah you’re right, they don’t let EVERYBODY get away. 
       Sometimes they have people that think James Comey’s a coward… 
       …who leave the organization and work with a private company.
       Other times, they may make up excuses for other officers or investigators.
       The truth is, the FBI is caught being totally oblivious to a number of things…
       …like Larry Nassar, or like Ted Kascinzki.
       That’s because, a lot of people lie. A lot of people also judge one another based on:
           1) who they know
           2) how much money they have 
           3) their reputation
       But, sometimes people like ME, exist…
       …where people are legitimately afraid of me because of how intelligent I am.
       When people judge ME, I am able to EFFORTLESSLY catch people off guard. 
       I don’t get it. 
       Every single time. 
       They said something, I made an immediate observation and responded.
       My response caused them to go from:
           "Heh, whatever fuckin’ clown boy…" to 
           "You have my fully undivided attention."
       They say things I see right through, so when they LIE to me…
       …they don’t realize that I’m a LOT more intelligent than I look…
       …I’m not psychotic, and I’m walking lie detector. 
       I am a LOT better at this process than the police are, or the psychiatrists, or doctors.
       Their ONLY defense against it, is to: 
           1) rest on their laurels, and 
           2) pretend like I MUST be wrong about something.
       Using the terms (WOULD’VE BEEN/MUST BE/GOTTA BE) in a sentence, is typically a FALLACY, but NOT ALWAYS.
       So, when these police/doctors/etc. start making assumptions, I have to say stuff like:
       "When you attended Kmart to get your PhD, did you have a dildo in your ass that whole time? Or partially?"
       They don’t really ever know how to respond to something like that...
       ...because it’s such a sophisticated statement.
       Some of them actually start crying.
       But, they know I’m not wrong about anything…
       …they just reason with themselves that they’ve earned the right to write me off.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(7,"Interactions",@"

I don’t try to belittle everybody I meet, but when I start to hear it in their voice...? 
I give it RIGHT back to em, and then they are typically shocked...~! 
I just, started acting incredibly rude...~!
For like NO REASON, huh?

There was a reason, but people constantly insult my intelligence, and they think nothing of it.
They may not understand that I’d rather punch somebody in the fuckin’ face first...
...than to be rude when people start to be very snobby to me.

But, that’s why these little witty comments I make, work so well. 

If I’m talking to the police and they’re just listening to key words I say, not the whole story, I’ll casually 
throw in a comment like "So, you have a dildo in your ass..., etc." ...that actually works a LOT better than 
having to assault people. Not to mention, it’s not illegal to say that.
    
The police don’t even really know what to DO if I say something like that to them. 
They might even still be nodding and smiling. 

But- if they have a puzzled look on their face...? 
I know they heard that. 

Sometimes they may even start to reach for some handcuffs or something...? 
But, then they realize that I didn’t commit a crime or anything, I just casually insulted them. 
So, if they do it to me? That’s fine in their eyes.
But if I do it in return...? They don’t fuckin’ like that, believe it or not...

SOMETIMES, when I do that in RETURN, they may actually look like they’re reaching for their handcuffs...
But- they do that BEFORE they have a LEGAL reason to.
It’s because they’re used to being RESPECTED, even if they’re DISRESPECTING a citizen. 

So if they’re DISRESPECTED, they’ll feel like you JUST ABOUT committed a CRIME... but, shockingly, a police 
officer that’s not paying attention, is a sign of disrespect... that means they don’t care what I have to say. 
So it isn’t actually illegal at all if I tell them that they have a dildo in their ass, believe it or not.

I won’t do that if they did nothing to warrant that. But, when they have, I will do that because I know they’re 
not fuckin’ paying attention and that is disrespectful. They don’t realize that I just manipulated them, and 
didn’t commit a crime or anything... So, the end result is that I get their undivided attention, didn’t commit 
a crime, that itself, continues to confuse them too.

At which point I have to pivot based on their responses.

Thing is, somebody might say “Well, that’s a great way to get their cooperation, isn’t it?” Heh. Well...
If I have to resort to a tactic like this, they had no plan or intention of cooperating with me, to begin with.
    
When these police (or really people in general) don’t understand that someone such as myself is a LOT more
intelligent than most people, they may even try to classify that person as insane, ESPECIALLY if they’re NOT. 

So, if I’m standing in a room with (3) police officers recording an audio recording of the entire conversation, 
they will casually insult my intelligence, and then be recorded doing so. So, the recording will help after they
categorize me incorrectly, because categorizing someone correctly can require EFFORT. 

Effort is a rare resource when it comes to them. 
It’s not something that I ever see a lot of police, doctors, or lawyers APPLY very much of. Why...? 
Because they think that MONEY is the only way to MOTIVATE people. Or, they say to themselves that MONEY or FAME 
are the only reasons anyone does anything. But, they’re not very creative... 

There are many other ways to motivate people, but Americans are typically unable to understand what those 
things actually ARE, at least, not until you state them out loud.
  __________________________________________
  | FEAR                 great   motivator |
  | MONEY         not as great a motivator |
  | EMBARASSMENT   pretty good   motivator |
  | JEALOUSY       pretty good   motivator |
  | ORGASMING        very good   motivator |
  | REPUTATION        moderate   motivator |
  | plenty more...                         |
  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
...all of these things are “motivators”. 

You might think these are all OBVIOUS, BUT- if I don’t SAY them to the police, they’ll think that MONEY or FAME 
are the only motivating factors in existence. I’m not really even exaggerating that.

Not until I say ^ those things, then they’ll say “obviously”. Well, right. 
I had to state the OBVIOUS because the police won’t actually consider these factors unless they’re stated out 
loud. Then they’ll resort to sounding like YOU’RE being ridiculous, not them.

Everybody with me so far...? Ok.

So when Ted Cruz wants his buddies at Exxon Mobil to make him orgasm in his asshole... 
        --------           ----------------------             ------
How motivated do you think Ted Cruz will be...? VERY.
    ---------              --------             ----
What about the police that haven’t arrested Ted Cruz...? They will, too.
    
When they don’t really feel like applying any EFFORT, there is a very real possibility that the POLICE are 
COMMITTING CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. It’s not a CONSISTENT case, because the CONDITIONS VARY. However, if it 
happens OVER and OVER and can be PROVEN to the PUBLIC, then who the hell does something about that...? 

Well, it’s a good question because I don’t think anybody does.
Think of it like this, call 911 and say "Ted Cruz the senator from Texas, is accepting bribery from Exxon Mobil".
Then they’ll say "Sir, that doesn’t sound like an emergency."
Well, it SHOULDN’T sound like an emergency, because someone should’ve fucking handled that by now.
                                                    ---------------------------------------------  
But it IS actually an emergency, and the reason why it IS...
...is because someone COULD get themselves killed for not doing their job.

People might even try and label me as an extremist for having these opinions...
...but I’m going to elaborate on how ridiculous most people really are.

[Begin comparison]
It’s ok if...
- Hillary Clinton leaks classified documents, generating a matter of national security
- Sean Hannity says "climate change isn’t real" on Fox News, and then gets paid `$100M by RUPERT MURDOCK
- TUCKER CARLSON does that too.
- Exxon Mobil fucks Ted Cruz in the ass in exchange for `$500M, which is BRIBERY
- Bob Lutz spent 50 years making terrible vehicles at GM
    
It’s NOT ok if...
- I say those people should probably be shot to death for lying to people, or being above the law
[End comparison]

Just so we’re clear here, *I* don’t have those intentions at all, I’m clearly making a comparison.
I’m expressing my opinion that Theodore Roosevelt would’ve shared, cause he had a pretty big problem with 
shit like that. 

I’ll say it again...
Just so we’re clear here, *I* don’t have those intentions at all. 
But I definitely am a firm believer, that if someone ELSE decides to shoot them... Well, thank fucking god.

Wouldn’t say something like that if the law were applied equally and unilaterally, so that no one was being 
PROVIDED with exceptions, and then everyone was treated equally. 
                                   ----------------------------
We wouldn’t want anybody to be above the law or anything like that... would we? Nah. 
Everybody has to follow the same laws, that means everybody has to be held accountable when they break them, 
which means that certain people that break laws are above the law and that means they are ROYALTY. 
    
Nah. People being above the law, being treated like ROYALTY in a country with no royalty whatsoever, means 
that there’s a hidden government. Wouldn’t exist if people got shot every time they tried to be above the law.
               -----------------
Believe it or not, the Constitution is literally written the way that it is, because they knew that people
would do this whole process of “being above the law”, or even “writing ridiculous unconstitutional laws”.
Basically what I’m saying is that guys like Benjamin Franklin, made DAMN CERTAIN, that it’d be legal for...
...constituents to do something about the existence of “royalty” or “hidden government”.

I’m not the type of dude who condones EXTREMISM, RACISM, or TERRORISM, or supports random people getting 
killed at supermarkets, churches, buildings, bombings, etc.

So allow me to be clear here... people’s constitutional rights are being overridden on a daily basis.
It has been happening since October 26th, 2001.

$Book.AddSection(7,"Excerpt [~] Familiar with the Technology",@"
An excerpt that I wrote following the situation where SCSO SCOTT SCHELLING REFUSED TO COLLECT EVIDENCE FROM MY
DEVICE ON 05/26/20. Original:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Q11HnRmAuCd_HAJZPLEoWJIujv9Jpyq1O1I5MODqWk

Over time, I may wind up making additional observations AND, changing my stance/stature on certain statements
I've written. In this case, RETIRED NEW YORK STATE POLICE TROOPER SHAEMUS LEAVEY, was not acting entirely 
MALICIOUS toward me, but rather, indifferent.

SHAEMUS LEAVEY did not knowingly contribute to the DISABLING OF MY APPLE iPhone 8+ on 05/27/20.
This document is basically my “AFTERTASTE” from SCSO-2020-028501, AND, I wrote this BEFORE...
SCSO DEPUTY MICHAEL MARTIN, and SCSO DEPUTY DJ THOMPSON arrested me on 06/01/20 at my residence...
...at the request of SCSO JAMES LEONARD

I’m Very Familiar With The Technology
Used to be, that there were fleets of vehicles and dudes/dudettes that drove around, using radios to find trouble, 
and then…? Telling the trouble they found, that there would be additional trouble for them… if they didn’t freeze, 
put their hands in the air, maybe they even threw in the occasional ‘wave em around like you just don’t care’… just 
to be an extra amount of ‘prick’.
I would do that. Anyone reading this, knows that I would. 
Guy tryin' to flush stacks of cash down the toilet…? 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me  : Freeze. 
      Put your hands in the air. 
      If you want, wave em around like you just don’t care.
Guy : Alright, ya got me.
      *puts his hands in the air* I'm not gonna wave my hands around, though.
Me  : Hey, that's fine, dude.
      That was optional.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
Anyway... look. You ask an officer about anything technology related...? 
They’ll say the most mundane words you’ve ever heard… 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Cop : I’m not familiar with the technology, dude.
      I don’t even use Facebook…

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
...these statements may or may not be true… but they still have a pretty good idea of who you are, and they have 
people that ARE familiar with the technology give them each a daily briefing of YOU and YOUR social media posts,
emails, phone records, porn sites, all of that.

So, when people text drug dealers, that's something they actively (listen to/grade) as it’s happening.
Some people might say:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Somebody : Yeah RIGHT, dude.
           That's straight up bullshit.
           I know for a FACT that they don't listen to ME~!
           Otherwise, they would've arrested a LOT of people by now...
Me       : Nah, listen you moron.
           Some of them do that.
           That's what the NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY does.
           Just in case you didn't KNOW that the PHONE COMPANIES do that shit...
Somebody : Oh, yeah...?
           Then, why don't they fuckin' arrest me then...? Hm...?
Me       : Uh, well, dipshit...
           They have to have probable cause, and petty amounts of drugs aren't going to cause them to swoop in.
           They’re not gonna chase down every dealer they see or hear on the scanner.
           If they did that…? 
           They would never be free to do anything else.
Somebody : Yeah, well, whatever dude...
           Who the fuck are YOU, anyway...?
           Mr. fuckin' know-it-all...?
Me       : Nah man...
           I'm just tellin ya because I use common sense to detect when morons think they're worth watching.
           Some of them do far worse shit than selling or buying drugs.
           Some of them kill innocent people and then manufacture evidence to incriminate the person they killed.
           They're not gonna inconvenience themselves with comin' after YOU.
Somebody : Yeah, well... fuck you ANYWAY, bro.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
At any rate, I’ve noticed that every time the police come to ‘offer help’…?
There’s always some type of [sanity check*] involved.

Which, I understand, because you wanna make sure that if someone says “drones disguised as birds”, that it's a 
thing they should take seriously, OR... maybe they just pretend that someone is insane even though every record
says “neg mental illness”. That's strange, right...? If ALL of the RECORDS say “neg mental illness”, but- they
treat a particular subject as if they DO have a mental illness...? That's something a lazy cocksucker would do.

Although that's a side point, it's somewhat relevant.
However, it would seem… as if every person I’ve tried to tell..?
Some people just resort to saying “this dude is nuts…” ...instead of asking to see the evidence...

Even 2+ years later...? Not much has changed. 
When people hear about EVIDENCE existing...? 
Well, their ARMS go limp, or maybe they suddenly experienced a burst of short-term paralysis in the brain region.

So NOW, they're basically on the bench... flustered. 
Exhausted, even.

NOW, they couldn't make sense of something like EVIDENCE, even if they wanted to. 
Because... a word like EVIDENCE makes EVERY SOCIAL INTERACTION very fuckin' complicated. 
Ya know...? 

A moment BEFORE you say a word like EVIDENCE...? 
They're TOTALLY fine. 
No paralysis, paying attention, smiles and laughs all around the dinner table, life is grand. 

But, the very second that you say the word EVIDENCE...? 
That's... basically issuing somebody a panic attack. 

Now, you're a REAL asshole, dude. 
Look at how much fuckin' stress you put that person through by saying (1) word...

Because that's... tough man, looking at EVIDENCE is actually a traumatic experience for some people. 
Because, then they have to apply EFFORT, to understand what “it” is...
That's what makes it such a harrowing experience.

You may as well convince that person to get life insurance BEFORE you even THINK about saying a word like that.

Maybe it just seems hard to believe… I’m a rare type of person who knows a lot about information technology. 
Not just one field or a couple, but a good general knowledge of what a wise investment in time/resources versus 
a wasteful one is, and how to properly educate people the difference between the two. Naturally, fat cats that 
like being lazy… they hate my guts. (← Some of the wrong people are gonna get offended by that, they shouldn't)
So… ALREADY worth a LOT to LIMIT and such. 
Also, investigating a corporate/government monopoly, in which the best fiber optic internet backbone is held 
captive, and the shitty one that costs a lot more, isn’t. On top of that, there’s a serial killer with a badge 
that protects this monopoly in particular, mainly because, they’ve been through (2)-(3) Sherman Antitrust 
Class Action Lawsuits before… so they had to change the name of the company a couple times… 

Like, from BELL (named after ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL), to BELL ATLANTIC/PACIFIC, and then BELL ATLANTIC eventually
became BOTH Verizon Communications AND AT&T. Cool...? (2) mobile phone service providers are the same company...?
Well, yeah. There's no competition between AT&T and Verizon. They are BOTH OWNED by the SAME PARENT COMPANY.

Anyway...
Whether or not [I, MICHAEL C. COOK SR.*] have the amount of money I am worth, OR, someone ELSE that isn’t me… 
...has [the money I, MICHAEL C. COOK SR.*] am worth… a lot of morons will fail to understand how my investigation
eventually led to a new situation that won’t be that RARE… 

…people that I’m investigating going to prison. (APT29, CERBERUS, and many many more)
For [OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE*]. That's what the TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES are doing in COORDINATION with the
TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, and the LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM, and the JUSTICE SYSTEM.

Everybody with me so far...? People that haven't been caught committing crimes have the internet under a single
control...? News and propaganda are distributed as if they're the same thing over the CORPORATE OWNED INTERNET 
INFRASTRUCTURE...? 1984 by GEORGE ORWELL...? NOAM CHOMSKY...? JULIEN ASSANGE...? EDWARD SNOWDEN...? 
Absolute power corrupts absolutely...? Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it...?

Yeah, so, ALL of those things are what AMERICANS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCE, and they get to be DISTRACTED by all this
shit out there, like “the Consitution grants people 'rights'”. That one will REALLY piss people off, because once
I start saying shit like “Nah, people don't have rights anymore, they're just lied to about whether they have any”,
that will immediately cause people that don't know they're constantly lied to, controlled, and manipulated, to 
immediately feel EXTREMELY OFFENDED AND BUTT HURT...
But that's ok. That's a sign of an ESTROGEN FUELED DECISION where someone chose to act like a CHILD when they were
shown a number of COMPELLING ARGUMENTS in RAPID SUCCESSION. Normally, people will walk out of a room before they
are even shown the most critical supporting evidence that suggests my statement. That's why people are morons.

Fun fact: OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE is what it is called, when incompetent lawmen work a lot harder to DESTROY evidence 
of them committing ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES, from ever seeing the light of day. 

SOME people are actually MORONS and they think that the police can commit illegal activities, so don't just them.
So like, DEREK CHAUVIN is a perfect example of where people who think like that have to be SHOWN how that line of
reasoning is retarded. When I say 'retarded'...? What I mean is that it's ok if a police officer has to EXCEED the
SPEED LIMIT to pull over someone who's SPEEDING. What is NOT ok, is if they KILL SOMEONE IN COLD BLOOD, and then
the POLICE DEPARTMENT REFUSES TO RELEASE THE BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE. Why...? Because that police officer DEFINITELY
killed someone in cold blood and they would PREFER that the PUBLIC NOT SEE THAT AT ALL.

This is why “COLLATERAL MURDER” is such a COMPELLING ARGUMENT that LINE OF REASONING is RETARDED.

NOW, they can use this program called PRISM/PEGASUS to prevent evidence from making it to another law man’s hand.
That’s what they’re using it for to track me… and it is what they use to DESTROY EVIDENCE on a target SMARTPHONE.
REMOTELY, by the way. They don't have to plug anything into your device to destroy evidence on your smartphone.
Nah, they can just ask a hacker to find your account, mac address, and then remotely WIPE your device. Cool...?
There are a laundry list of OTHER violations and felonies that I will be adding... (in the book) but-
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE is a super big, important, critical fuckin’ thing, that MOST people would NEVER EVEN DARE
to DO nor CONSIDER… but- these guys do it every day. Don’t they...? People would be FLAT OUT IMPRESSED if they
ever realize just how often the police DESTROY EVIDENCE of THEM, COMMITTING ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES like DEREK CHAUVIN.

$Book.AddSection(7,"Cop Types",@"
Anyway, the officers that scoped out your profile...? 
Well, they could be assisting serial killers AS WELL ASS good guy cops… 
The good guy cops might not have an inkling of suspicion or merely a single clue… 
…that they work with a serial killer who has a badge, and logs everything for later… 
…a good little dependable MAFIOSO who's paid UNDER THE TABLE by a MAFIA BOSS...
…one that doesn’t bother to let his bro know that he saw something worth looking at a little more closely later...
Now, to combat theses evil-doin’, sleeper-cell type of activity, fuck-faced bastards… 
...you gotta have some BASIC cop-type detection skills.

Could it be a REAL cop..?
Or, a fake-ass cop..?
Could be a REAL cop that isn’t an asshole like that... and you might offend a REAL cop by tellin' him that his
buddy who's been his partner for a REAL long time, is a fake-ass cop. NOW, you've just pissed off a REAL cop...
That REAL cop is not gonna be YOUR buddy ANY MORE after that.
Nope.
Dude's gonna cross his arms...?
And flat out tell ya some shit that sounds a lot like “You're not invited to MY birthday party, dude.”

Now you're REAL fucked, dude.
Unless that cop happens to keep some comment like that in the back of his mind and maintains his or her ability
to be OFFENDED, because... cops know how to deal with being offended alright. They try not to tell people... but,
they have heard a few people say some bad words in their day. They have thick skin, they're not gonna ALLOW 
themselves to be a fragile little snowflake who goes 0-100 at the sign of (1) offensive comment or swear word.

Anyway, a fake-ass cop heard me tell a REAL cop, that some OTHER cop, happened to be a real fuckin clown boy, AS 
WELL AS, a fake-ass cop... well, the REAL cop AND the fake-ass cop heard me loud and clear... and they both wanted 
to keep their concerns on the super underground level, of the most down-low, low-key, low-pass, low-filter, lowest 
of most undetectable handoffs… 

Cause that was the signal. They knew it was time to inconspicuously lay down some beats…
...drop the mike…
...press start to begin the mission…
...now they're crawling through vents like Liquid Snake...
...or wearing an eye patch like Snake Plisken...
...could be THAT type of cop…
Then again, maybe it isn't even that intense yet. Might be a lame-ass, no-game-havin’, fake-cheesecake-bakin’, 
drives-a-car-barefoot-like-Fred-fuckin-Flintstone… douchebag cop that IS an asshole like that...? 
But, everyone still thinks he’s cool and trustworthy…
Not a wide range of multiple cop types, it seems. However, that's just what some of them WANT you to think...
There's a wide range of multiple cop types for certain.

$Book.AddSection(7,"Familiar with the Technology (2)",@"
Anyway, until then, ask a cop to do some information technology related work… or ask for some help obtaining the
evidence from your phone… Your DEAD phone… like my Apple iPhone 8+. 
Instead of not knowing how wires plug into one…? 
They can just pretend to be fucking lazy, and not do that - like they currently do.
So, even if you have EVIDENCE of a SERIAL KILLER on YOUR PHONE…? 
It doesn’t actually COUNT as LEGAL EVIDENCE until a (3)rd copy of the evidence shows up elsewhere.
If you have evidence like this...? That's actually a fucking crime in some people's eyes.

Because they already have the (2)nd copy, you're not allowed to even have the (1)st copy... 
Which means, if there isn’t another copy elsewhere, then they can pretend that you set off the power at some 
totally different address... and ARREST you so that they can DESTROY that (1)st copy of the evidence you have.

Because, they know you can use multiple phones and multiple MAC Addresses… 
And that IS NOT against the law, but they will sure as hell treat you as if you practically committed one...
They'll ARREST you for having that (1)st copy of EVIDENCE of THEM, doing something SHADY/ILLEGAL.

Unfortunately, they may have to plug the device in NOW… because… 
SCOTT SCHELLING wants to know if you’re bluffing him or not…
SCOTT SCHELLING doesn't like being LIED to, OR told that you called 911 twice...
Because if you did...? He would've been there, man. The first guy on the scene.

Even if he STILL wound up being the first guy on the scene...?
Doesn't matter, cause YOU made (2) 911 calls that the 911 dispatch station didn't confirm or answer.
And that is against the law for YOU, to call 911 twice, and them deciding NOT to answer those calls.
Very illegal.

But- if that sounds retarded...? Then, you’re like ME.
So, you'll have to ask ANOTHER cop like JEFFREY KAPLAN follow you… so that you know MULTIPLE VEHICLES brought 
you home… from nearly arresting your ass for calling 911 twice while a couple dudes were attempting to murder you.
Yeah. That'll show YOU ya fuckin' troublemaker...

The reason why (2) vehicles were at a SECONDARY LOCATION in SCSO-2020-028501, is because the one cop was ACTING as
if he may at any moment whatsoever, play the whole “he went for my gun” trick… the standard Pickett go-to.
Yeah, the Pickett brothers probably aren't known for saying “he went for my gun” at all... 
But- it is probably a tactic that they would agree, sounds pretty fuckin' funny... 
...at least up until the cops actually start using that excuse to kill innocent people like NYSP TROOPER RUFFAS.

Could be something that they do, OR… me kidding around as usual. You never know.
In THIS specific emergency type situation…?
No one knows WHO to suggest YOU contact.

Me        : I mean, they didn't SAY those words...

Me        : Yeh.
Schelling : Well dude, I can arrest you for saying something like that...
            You sure that's the official story you wanna give me here...?
Me        : I have evidence on my device.
Schelling : Yeah right, dude.
            You don't have evidence on that device...
            I would've seen it by now, if it did.

            Hm...?

            I have call logs and I even left FOOTAGE at CENTER FOR SECURITY of ME trying to call 911.

Since 911 wasn’t working… and a police officer that would NORMALLY want to protect you from a serial killer? 
This one happens to be ASSISTING said SERIAL KILLER, so... if your phone dies...? So do you.
They'll even tell ya “Fuck you for even having a phone, dude...”

I'm being obtuse. But, they are also obtuse sometimes.

Instead of having to put up with THIS type of situation, one that'd more than likely be the LAST type of situation
you could HYPOTHETICALLY have to put up with…? You could save yourself some trouble, and don’t bother calling the
kindergartners… cause they're gonna get tired after 20 minutes of (hard labor/cartoons), and then ask for a juice
box, so that they can get a nice hour or two of a real comfy ass nap in the middle of their shift.

$Book.AddSection(7,"Law Enforcement vs Law Avoidance",@"
That's what THEY need.
But, if you ever find yourself in this same type of situation...? Well, what YOU'LL need, is a guy like me.
One that has the SAME LAW ENFORCEMENT capabilities that a REGULAR COP would have…?
And that's all it is, there's no LAW AVOIDANCE going on at all, like some of the REGULAR COPS perform.

LAW ENFORCEMENT is when LAWS are ENFORCED.
LAW AVOIDANCE is when LAWS are AVOIDED.

Being able to determine a LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER from a LAW AVOIDANCE OFFICER, is pretty important.

TROOPER DICKSON, RIZANNO, O'NEIL, BAKER, ENNIST, CARTER, and SHAEMUS LEAVEY are → [LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS]...
...which means that they ENFORCE the law... so if they observe something ILLEGAL, they do their job CORRECTLY.
                         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Whereas ROBERT MESSINES SR. and JR., SERGEANT BOSCO, and TROOPER RUFFAS are LAW AVOIDANCE OFFICERS.
...which means that they AVOID the law... so if they observe something LEGAL, they do their job INCORRECTLY.
                         ¯¯¯¯¯
TROOPER BORDEN, is SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE... One day, he might ENFORCE the law. Might do that 95% of the day.
But that last 5% is where TROOPER BORDEN might REALLY confuse the piss out of everybody... Dude made a name for
himself being such an honorable LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, until the last interaction of any given day.

He didn't get a JUICE BOX and a NAP at a U-TURN like he NORMALLY would.
Well, these things caused this dude to be PRETTY FUCKIN' CRANKY, and so, he actually participated in some
LAW AVOIDANCE... and assisted ERIC CATRICALA attempt to ARREST ME for BEING AT A PLACE THAT I WASN'T AT.
And, not (1) single person except ME and HIM... was none the wiser.

Do these officers understand the notion that I don't have them all under the same category...?
Well, good.

Some people think that ALL of the police do their job, otherwise, they wouldn't have their job.
But, some people have been fed leaded paint chips and leaded water, and experienced BRAIN DAMAGE from all of the
poisonous lead that they ingested thinking things like FALLACIOUS CIRCLES OF LOGIC.

Like, some people actually think that OBVIOUSLY if someone put a SCREEN DOOR ON A SUBMARINE, then that's fine.
It was a design choice. There's no way that it'll sink because of that. (← that's why some people are retarded)

I would be very familiar with the technology… and, I would throw in quite a number of lame ass, cheesy puns. 
Ones that get old real fast...? But, still sound so stupid... that it's STILL worthy of an additional laugh… 
So funny that people will RELUCTANTLY laugh out loud...
You ever seen somebody RELUCTANTLY start bursting with laughter...? Well, that's me.

I know how wires work, AND…? I’m not too lazy to give a different wire a shot, if you were to tell me that a cop 
I work with either IS a SERIAL KILLER, or COLLABORATES with one. There have been (0) police officers who’ve 
seemingly had the same exact line of reasoning… and the number MAY be MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT...? 
But, I can't explicitly state that as a certainty because, somebody could wind up being in a tough spot.

Maybe some of them that have been on the fence about ME, or my THEORIES...? 
Maybe they don’t realize that I’ve been working (MULTIPLE) class action lawsuits in tandem…

Apple, Facebook, Asus, Bell Atlantic/Verizon, Spectrum, State of New York... they're all gonna be sued at the same 
exact time, because they're CO-CONSPIRATORS. And maybe THAT’S why they don’t believe in cop serial killers...
Regardless… I would already have all of the information necessary to help you. 
Not unlike CITIZEN LAB, which is based in CANADA, and has worked with AL-JEZEERA to determine with SHEER CERTAINTY,
that someone was USING PEGASUS to SPY on REPORTERS that work for AL-JEZEERA, and this was like... AFTER I wound up
learning FIRST HAND, that I had this PROGRAM dispatched to my fuckin' device.

You gotta figure, an awesome cop doesn’t sleep at night when he knows somebody is in trouble.
So, he does his own homework. Might have to tell his pet iguana to back off if he’s getting a little mouthy… 
Otherwise…? You’re not likely to have an easy time getting this type of cop to mess up his routine… outperforming 
this top notch son of a bitch...? It’s impossible. 

Even on his worst day ever… still can’t be done… Not via any conventional means anyay…
Lawyer Man 5000 would even tell ya, this cop is one that can't be beaten without having a fuckin parade of veteran
investigators, captains, sergeants, and retired cop heroes...
There exists no known organization or government entity that 1) does this, or 2) thinks that this would be a 
perfect way to show EVERYBODY, how, over time...? Teddy Roosevelt has to come back from the dead and train a new
generation of recruits that have 1) integrity, and 2) perseverance... because, trades such as LAW ENFORCEMENT 
need to ADAPT to NEW TIMES/CONDITIONS. And, that is EXACTLY what the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001 was WRITTEN FOR.

$Book.AddSection(7,"Qui-Gon Jinn, Bryan Mills, or Rahs Al Guhl",@"
All cops should have a mandatory Batman 101 course, where they each have to learn a number of things, like: 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
| Hand-to-hand combat (CQC) | Psychological Manipulation | Programming and logic | How to fill out paperwork |
| Bat-belt tools 101 | Properly issuing citations | Firearm Assembly/Disassembly | Firearm Accuracy training |

...by one of the most fearsome roles that Liam Neeson has ever played, as an actor. To be fair...?
You really don't wanna piss off Bryan Mills, who was a former Green Beret, and he's... got a VERY particular
set of skills... He will fuckin' find you where ever, even if you live on a god damn boat, dude. So...

Information Technology 101… ALL police officers have to take dead phone evidence seriously>
Maybe the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001 could be AMENDED so that POLICE OFFICERS CAN BE CHARGED WITH A CRIME for...
...failing to follow a STATUTE where smartphones being HACKED by somebody is basically the same thing as a 
PHYSICAL TRESPASSER that can be INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED...

BUT- sometimes you might have to EDUCATE some of the police that WEREN'T PROPERLY TRAINED, on how to DO that.
For instance, most of the police in CLIFTON PARK, NY, and SARATOGA COUNTY.

I mean, it could actually be a FELONY to not ASCERTAIN EVIDENCE of an ATTEMPTED MURDER when they’re just too 
fuckin' lazy to plug in a wire that all police cruisers should be issued… since they have places like GOLDSTEIN 
install SUPERCHARGER, ENGINE ENHANCEMENTS, ALTERNATOR ENHANCEMENTS, CAMERA AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS, LIGHT SYSTEMS, 
and RADIO EQUIPMENT... so like, the EXCUSE to not have a MULTI ADAPTER CABLE to PLUG IN A DEVICE to COLLECT 
EVIDENCE...? Well, holy fuck. There must be some SINISTER FUCKING REASON that isn't the case already, right?

It just so happens, there IS a sinister reason for that.
Because LAW AVOIDANCE OFFICERS will actually get pretty pissed if they have to perform ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT DUTIES.
That's right. You dont' wanna piss of LAW AVOIDANCE OFFICERS like TROOPER RUFFAS. Nah. He doesn't like when he is
told that a CRIME WAS COMMITTED, because, HE WOULD PREFER TO PROTECT THE PERSON WHO COMMITTED THAT CRIME, rather
than to PERFORM LAW ENFORCEMENT.

That's why I don't particularly CARE for TROOPER RUFFAS. He's a LAZY FUCK. He's more than just a LAZY FUCK.
You can be just like me, and determine with SHEER CERTAINTY by the FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AN OFFICER MAKES, that
they're IGNORING MANY OF THE STATEMENTS that a LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WOULD TAKE SERIOUSLY.

Then again, MAYBE... TROOPER RUFFAS is just a dumbass. Ya know...? MAYBE, he doesn't know how to read a CITATION
BOOK, and THAT'S why it APPEARS as if he's a fuckin' GESTAPPO/MAFIOSO and not a LAW ENFORCMENT OFFICER.

TROOPER RUFFAS is gonna get wicked pissed if ANYBODY tells HIM, HOW TO DO HIS JOB CORRECTLY.
Because, THEN the police will have to install a brand new piece of equipment that charges their POS toughbook 
batteries… Then, the cables that they have to plug devices into, they might get FRAYED or DAMAGED, and THAT is 
just... a fuckin REAL headache, and THAT'S why TROOPER RUFFAS will get WICKED PISSED, to have to OCCASIONALLY
PERFORM LAW ENFORCEMENT.

I understand. Cables get damaged all the time. So do the laser based radar guns that they use to see how FAST
people are driving. TROOPER RUFFAS likes those things, doesn't complain about those fuckin things breaking at
ALL, does he...? Nah. Those things are ENJOYABLE for DIPSHITS LIKE HIM, to use. But, a WIRE that CHARGES
MULTIPLE TYPES OF SMARTPHONES that may have EVIDENCE of an ATTEMPTED MURDER...? 

That's... too much of a fuckin' hassle for some dipshit like TROOPER RUFFAS.
WAY too difficult to do something like that. 
It'd just be a LOT easier for him to GRAB A JUICE BOX, and a BLANKET, and then... take a fuckin 5 hour nap.
Right in the middle of his shift. Nobody will stop him from doin that because, he will literally outperform 
ANY other LAW AVOIDANCE OFFICER on staff, AND, he's in a MUCH DIFFERENT PAY GRADE because of the QUALITY of 
LAW AVOIDANCE SERVICES that he provides the STATE OF NEW YORK.

Does any of that shit sound retarded...?
Well, fuck you for thinkin that, cause TROOPER RUFFAS will agree with everything I just said.
So will TROOPER MESSINES. And, SERGEANT BOSCO, though I'm on the fence about HIM, because he may actually
be SUGGESTIBLE with the EVIDENCE... 

The bottom line is that... if GOLDSTEIN is willing to charge `$17K to install those camera systems like 2G32 told
me on 08/05/20 near JOES CARS on US-9 after the incident at 1602 US-9, where TROOPER OPOBANO came and handed off
the DISORDERLY CONDUCT paperwork/bullshit arrest...? Then, GOLDSTEIN should ALSO install a `$5 adapter that they 
LITERALLY SELL at EVERY FUCKIN' GAS STATION and WALMART, or even a dollar store...? 
They have those adapters there... Why would the FUCKING EXPENSIVE STATE TROOPER VEHICLES, OR the SARATOGA COUNTY 
SHERIFF VEHICLES have NONE of those adapters installed in them, out of the gate...? 

Well, it could be because the LAW AVOIDANCE OFFICERS will ROUTINELY BREAK THEM ON PURPOSE.
Even if it would prevent a police officer from having any fucking excuse whatsoever, to not 1) plug the fucking 
thing into the charge port, and 2) capture the fucking evidence on the phone.

The problem is that there are too many lazy fucks like TROOPER RUFFAS.
Plain and simple, they don't like following the law. They like BREAKING the law as often as they can.

TROOPER RUFFAS will actually be EXTREMELY HONORED by the notion that I've highlighted his most useful skillset.
He will actually start to float his head around like JORDAN PEELE does when the KEEGAN MICHAEL KEY/HOTEL CLERK 
tells him about the FREE CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST. It will be such an EXTRAORDINARY sense of ENTITLEMENT and PURPOSE,
that someone finally admitted publicly, that they ADMIRE his LEGENDARY TALENT. He'll finally feel an overwhelming
sense of ACCOMPLISHMENT, and RECOGNITION... he'll be truly AMAZED and FULL OF HIMSELF, and he should.

Give credit where credit is due... If you're an evil son of a bitch like he is...? You deserve that credit.
But, it's gonna come off as rather anti-climactic, because then he's gonna realize that his coworkers are gonna
be watching him a lot more closely.

At least in SCOTT SCHELLING's case, he hasn't openly admitted that he's a cold hearted cocksucker at all, he's 
done something FAR LESS SEVERE. While I still am perturbed by his BEHAVIORS after SCSO-2020-028501, I don't 
think that SCOTT SCHELLING has done anything to deserve being SHOT TO DEATH, unlike TROOPER RUFFAS.

Let me make myself perfectly clear so that TROOPER RUFFAS doesn't take what I said, out of context.
There has been NO THREAT MADE WHATSOEVER, so if someone INTERPRETS that a THREAT WAS MADE...
...that's mainly because, they may be RETARDED, or have experienced SEVERE BRAIN DAMAGE, and thus, CAN'T READ.

TROOPER RUFFAS has indicated to me, specifically with his FACIAL EXPRESSIONS and IGNORING SOME OF MY COMMENTS, 
that he fuckin REALLY looks forward to being shot to death by SOMEBODY.

Just because I made that OBSERVATION, doesn't mean I have any earthly idea if that will EVER HAPPEN.
I'm just saying, I've DETECTED EXTREMELY MALICIOUS AND NEFARIOUS INTENT FROM THIS PARTICULAR COCKSUCKER.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(7,"Familiar with the Technology (4)",@"
Once humanity gets to a point in time where police officers can no longer be taken seriously if they say 
something stupid, such as “I’m not familiar with the technology”...? 

Well, then that police officer type will go obsolete. Pretty fucking soon, or eventually at some point.
If people try to say “they already exist”, then they should consider doing some homework.

Stating “I'm not familiar with the technology” is akin to saying “I don't know how to fuck girls...” 
Because that’s literally an admission of being too fucking lazy to plug in a god damn `$5 wire.
I'm fairly certain that having a mobile device is a REQUIREMENT when you're a POLICE OFFICER… 

SO LIKE, saying retarded shit like that will just IMMEDIATELY indicate that you're workin' with a lazy cocksucker.
Might not necessarily be a MALICIOUS cocksucker, but- a lazy one that doesn't really wanna DO anything difficult.
Or, incredibly easy.

Because then the laziness factor turns right into OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
Anyway, currently, police officers, I would surmise, when they call to check in on your profile...?
They send a transmission to base, then, a guy just reads off your profile…
Whether it is accurate or up to date…?

It is not something that they typically CARE ABOUT, nor TAKE SERIOUSLY… 
...at least, based on my observations. I mean, just ask CAPTAIN SHELLEY ZEITSKE, she'll tell ya they don't.

Perhaps, some of them do take it a lot more seriously than most...?
But… I wish there were more than just SOME, that DO…
Because, it surely seems that if the money is right, some of these sad pricks get paid to confuse an L for a C.
So like, Michael L. Cook who has a WARRANT out for his arrest... some of these morons will pretend like 
the L looks basically exactly like a C, and then there's the CUFFS, there's an innocent person going to JAIL, and
then like, (3) weeks later...? Ah, finally released from jail. “Sorry about that, now fuck off.” -SCSO

SOMETIMES… you’ll get a prick that actually bets with his partner to see if he can arraign your ass off of a 
record that is ALMOST the same as yours..? But it isn’t yours, like I just described above.

Thompson : Dude... I'm not takin' that bet.
Pirrone  : C'mon dude, you really think that people will notice it...?
Thompson : I mean, I really don't think anybody will give a shit...?
           But at the same time, if he's got WITNESSES...?
           Then that's pretty retarded, dude.
Pirrone  : Well... I'm gonna try it anyway. If it fails...? I'll fuckin tell BROWNELL that this COOK dude posted
           some shit about purchasing a FIREARM for SELF DEFENSE against the CAPTAINS KIDS off of FARM TO MARKET

Look, whether that conversation happened or not, isn't what matters. What matters, is if people READ THAT, and 
some people start to to question “...those dudes probably WOULD have that conversation...”

In anyone elses case where they just arrest some innocent person, the next time that this prick brags about being 
able to cuff you and cause you to have to get your car out of the impound, the whatever bullshit ticket, plus
additional charges for any hint of added douchebaggery that the officer in question feels is appropriate for the 
given situation at hand…? It is literally what the system is designed to do to people.
To top it all off… let’s say that you always paid all of those fines off like a good little boy or girl… 
Well, nobody is even proud of you for doing that at all. If anything...? People will consider you to be a SCUMBAG,
even if you were INNOCENT, or you have PROOF. (← Typically morons)
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(7,"Systemic Injustice",@"
Now, you get to deal with a thing on your record which was bullshit… 
Maybe you even get sent back to jail in your last week of parole or probation… to serve the whole sentence. 
Maybe, screw all that…
You COULD just get SHANKED before you even see any prisoners. 
OR, they could just SAY that you went for their gun, and they had every right and reason to shoot you dead.
Which I would wager that 50% of the “went for my gun” stories are *bullshit*… 

Only because, even a fucking moron would have a difficult time attempting to do something so fuckin' stupid.
It is such a stupid thing for a person to try to do, that I don't think it is EVER A LEGITIMATE CASE.
Going for a police officers gun…? 
Well, anybody who believes this… is fuckin stupid. 

If people don't want me to consider them STUPID, I implore you to do more digging.
Most people won't do any digging at all, and they'll just believe whatever people tell them.
So if people say “That's not what I heard...”, the be prepared to call that person a fucking moron.

Because as far as I can tell, MOST PEOPLE HEAR A LOT OF THE WRONG SHIT.
I would go so far as to say, that [MOST PEOPLE IN PRISON or JAIL*], are probably INNOCENT of the CHARGES.
I'm making a strong assertion there because I'm certain that more than 50% of the people in PRISON or JAIL did
do something to deserve being placed there, however, a lot of innocent people are FRAMED, ACCUSED, and IMPRISONED.

The only reason they REMAIN in JAIL, is because PEOPLE DON'T FUCKING CARE. That's literally the reason why.
SOME people DO care, but they're REALLY RARE.

Whereas, people will CARE A LOT MORE when 19 kids and 2 teachers get shot to death.
Or, if it's some BLONDE HAIRED WHITE GIRL named GABBY PETITIO.
THAT'S when people give a shit.

Not if thousands of people get thrown into the prison system illegally, and they never get an opportunity to 
SHOW THEIR EVIDENCE. Nah. Not worth anybody to CARE ABOUT, or GIVE A SHIT ABOUT, because... who cares?
NOBODY cares. Not even me. Nope. Just sittin here, pounding away about SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE, and CORRUPT POLICE, 
because I actually don't fuckin' care at all... (I'm being sarcastic, if people can't tell.)
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(7,"Better Solutions",@"
At any rate, you could just do away with all of that muss and fuss… and tell SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE to fuck itself,
right in the god damn face. Cause. A better solution is out there, and it can be deployed so quickly that guys
like TROOPER RUFFAS won't have TIME to break the fuckin cables on purpose~!

Using my voice only, I could just enter the information in… without using a keyboard... Like, cops could DICTATE
each interaction, not unlike how they use the RADIO, ya know...? “Oh, why don't police officers ALREADY do that?”
It's because the police system is like a... communist party. That's essentially what it is. They don't APPLY 
great ideas all that often, UNLESS, it is to ASSIST them in providing SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE. Basically, if some rich
bastard with a lot of money makes a stink, and he wants somebody arrested for whatever...? The police are trained
on how to pull ANY bullshit reason out of thin air, because that's what LAW AVOIDANCE is ALL about.

However, at some point when I write enough of these stories...? LAW AVOIDANCE OFFICERS will be FORCED to adopt
newer and better ideas, newer because they finally started asking PROGRAMMERS and SECURITY ENGINEERS how to do 
better police work that was MORE FAIR across the board. They'll be FORCED to be LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS, again.

AUDIO DICTATION of an arrest or incident would allow the officer to SAY WHAT HAPPENED, and then the AI VOICE
RECOGNITION SOFTWARE then converts the AUDIO into a STREAM OF TYPED CHARACTERS, not unlike how CLOSED CAPTIONING
works. Or, VOICEMAIL to TEXT, works. Basically the same BULLETPROOF IDEA...

One guy. No lame ass keyboards that take up 80% of a dashboard… Voice to text… Holographic…
I mean, even the cop car drives itself. The officer can even analyze the data that was just recorded, just like in
the beginning of Blade Runner 2049. Piecing together a forensic investigation like you’re a 21st Century Sherlock
Holmes… TROOPER RUFFAS will actually have PLENTY of time to drink as MANY juice boxes as he would like, and take a
REAL comfy ass nap everywhere he goes... Cause he won't have to put a whole lot of THOUGHT, into his job.

It'd be nearly identical to the job he's SUPPOSED to do already...? But, killing innocent people will actually
cause HIM to be arrested by a fellow officer pretty quickly. And that's just how the future will one day be.

Facial recognition and/or ID matches…?
Then that’s who you are cowboy. If a situation is suggested that it’s a clone…?
Then we investigate further.
But, this will only be a reality for people after me and many others that like this idea, get killed by a serial 
killer police officer who ALSO, thinks that it would be a good idea to have these things… BUT- works a lot harder 
to prevent them from becoming a reality (such as TROOPER RUFFAS), than they do about SUPPORTING the ideas where 
they use more brain power and become slightly less useless (like TROOPER RUFFAS).
It isn’t a blanket ‘fuck you’ to all cops… just the ones like TROOPER RUFFAS.
I’m just saying, it would be nice if cops didn’t have to DRIVE their own VEHICLE, nor SPEND MONEY ON GAS, 
nor lie about not knowing how to charge a phone to pull pictures or video from… because, as if their job wasn't
already fucking easy enough...? It would be a standard thing that the academy would teach all recruits.
Because of how much more easy their job would BE, if they implemented ALL of these ideas.
The only reason these solutions aren't in place ALREADY, is because they have their PRIORITIES all fucked up.
They would rather track me, and follow me everywhere I go, because…? 
Maybe some people in the government are looking at prison time if they get CAUGHT AGAIN. 
Now, I say the word AGAIN, because they've already been caught NUMEROUS times.
But, the MAGIC of being in the GOVERNMENT, is that you have ACCESS to doing some REAL EVIL SHIT to people.
For instance, COMMITTING OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, DESTRUCTION OF EVIDENCE.

So, they will do EVERYTHING they can, to disillusion me... 
...and to cause me to question my own sanity.
The problem is, none of that will work. 

They're aware of this. The harder they try to disillusion me...? The more IDEAS they FEED me on how to expose them.
They have finally gotten it into their heads, that... 
MAYBE, trying to FOOL MICHAEL C. COOK SR. is a fuckin STUPID IDEA. 

The boss still gets to serve the rest of his life in prison, for attempting to kill me with additional compromised
police officers… and you know, many of the officers that had an idea of what was going on, and assisted this group
of people that were slowing down my RICO case? They get to spend time in jail or prison… it is up to them. 

The thing is, they're gonna keep treating my writing as if I'm some type of PSYCHOTIC INDIVIDUAL and that they 
have NOTHING to fear about what I write.

But that is why some people require some things to be EXPLAINED to them, in a similar manner to how a MENTALLY 
CHALLENGED person, fails to understand the punchline of a joke... Once it is EXPLAINED to them, then they really 
have FEWER OPTIONS to MISLABEL someone such as myself.
They're aware of this.
They know, if I succeed, then I will definitely be correct, they're looking at the rest of their life in prison.
So, the clock is running, we're in a race.

Them...? Attempting to THROW AS MANY BULLSHIT THINGS IN MY WAY and ON MY RECORD AS POSSIBLE, to SLOW ME DOWN.
Me...? Performing the work of 100 men, outperforming most people at whatever I set my mind to, because I'm a real
creative son of a bitch. 

That is why they are watching me constantly, 24/7.
Though, some of them do it because they're trying to protect me, they know that if they stop watching, I will 
get killed or go missing. They also know that I intend to manipulate these cocksuckers into attacking me again.
So, they've labeled me as a REAL BALLSY MOTHERFUCKER, ALRIGHT...
At any rate, these malicious actors in the government don’t realize, I already HAVE a team of people that are 
EXACTLY where they need to be. For THEIR protection, and so I don't somehow get CHARGED WITH ESPIONAGE ACT OF 1917,
they have to use the same tools that a MALICIOUS ACTOR like APT29 or CERBERUS would use, to commit ESPIONAGE and
CRIMES. But- they're not using those tools to HURT me, they're using them to CATCH these malicious actors in the 
act. Though, the more I write about it, the more manipulative it may seem... so, it's just a slow burning game of
10 dimensional chess.

The ALLIES versus the FUCKFACES.

They have the same access to the same program that the same police officers who could be attempting to kill me 
could have access to… and…?
It was used to monitor them, and record evidence of these idiots trying to kill me.
But- even though a copy of this footage exists within the UTAH DATA LAKE...
...that's classified.

So, I just have to ACCUMULATE MORE EVIDENCE and get a FEW MORE PIECES of EVIDENCE into a locker that isn’t 
compromised, that way, two locker’s hash values can be compared... one hash value has the evidence pulled from 
the NAND via desoldering from the logic board, and then reinserted into a totally separate logic board, in a 
process called “iPhone Data Recovery to be used in a criminal investigation”...
The other hash value would be the version that I already submitted in which the evidence that was uploaded could 
be changed and swapped in, made up evidence that the team serial killer police officers had submitted… 
But, because that team sucks dick at knowing how to stop someone like me…?
I already know their entire plan and, it just so happens that the backups were already made and shipped out.
Now, I don't actually KNOW this, but I SPECULATE it because, if you're someone working with matters of national
security, you'll wanna copy EVERYTHING.
Who knew, that whole time I was standing in front of the FBI gate… they were pulling the data off of my phone. 
Weird. I don't actually know that EITHER, but I SPECULATE as such...

You would have to be very familiar with the technology to know how that works. 
Unfortunately, you don’t get that type of professionalism from the NYSP nor SCSO, unless a MURDER was COMMITTED.
THEN they would actually be VERY INVOLVED in INVESTIGATING the murder, but not if the person went missing. 

Which is a sad state of affairs, that a person has to be killed, in order for them to DECIDE on whether to do this
process where they surgically move parts around without damaging the DATA, and then filing criminal charges against
the individuals I recorded on video. Wanna know why...? It's mainly because of LAW AVOIDANCE OFFICERS like:
NYSP TROOPER RUFFAS. I have NO DOUBT in my mind, that someone heard SHAEMUS LEAVEY confirm the existence of the 
video, and THEN, a chain of phone calls and text messages were sent from person to person, and then eventually, 
like MAGIC... ah. My iPhone 8+ that had a video of (2) cocksuckers attempting to kill me, is gone, along with ALL 
of the OTHER SENTIMENTAL STUFF ON THAT DEVICE.

So, if I had a conversation with my son on his 10th birthday for about 4 hours...?
Gone, dude. That shit was basically killed with vengeance.

I’m certain that they have some people that are qualified and DO know the technology, it’s just… no one knows 
1) where the fuck they ever are… and 2) do they actually exist, or is it a theory...?

But, personally...? *taps chest* I know there are GOOD GUYS like ED SNOWDEN and JULIEN ASSANGE out there, somewhere.
Good guys that ALSO DESPISE SYSTEMIC INJUSTICE...

But there are a lot of bad guys... and, they would PREFER that I shut the fuck up, and die.
Guys like NYSP TROOPER RUFFAS.

 NYSEG was giving free power to T-Mobile and AT&T Cell Towers in Clifton Park, NY. 
 That means that every customer had to pay their bill, but NYSEG and T-Mobile didn’t.
 
 Therefore, they’re both getting paid for the same amount of non-switch-flipping douchebaggery. 
 The type of professional that just conveniently somehow forgot to measure how many KwH that the tower was 
 blowing through…

 Sorta like some stupid fuck would do, one that shouldn’t have the fucking job to begin with. 
 I’d do that too if I was a lazy cocksucker (like TROOPER RUFFAS) that didn’t feel like getting out of my NYSEG 
 truck to record the KwH at each and every fucking meter in the town. 
 That’s sort of what that person’s job is, and it isn’t getting done.

 So, then you get pictures that are super rare, of me taking a few million dollars away from these (2) companies.
 Because, the (pictures+video) shows a criminal act happening… NYSEG and T-Mobile, STEALING MONEY from people.

 Once the cocksuckers officially write me a check for said amount, then… 
 I will use all of that money to continue investigating this RICO/Sherman Anti-Trust case against 
 Verizon/Bell/AT&T… which aims to do the same exact thing to them, but more of like a `$500B lawsuit… 
 …not like a standard `$15M pay with free HBO… this one is more like “permanently shut down”.

 | Censorship |
 ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 All of the internet service providers around here, they take part of this series of events where it is totally ok, 
 for people to hit a button that overrides this thing called “freedom of speech”. 

 This thing that I am referring to, it is called “Censorship”. 
 It’s when, you’re making a recording on your cell phone, and for whatever reason, during specific parts of a 
 recording that you’ve made… some <unspecified> gets to blow wind into the microphone that they’re using to shadow 
 your movement… 

 So, it'll sound a lot like actual wind… but- it isn’t actual wind. 
 It’s somebody like Andrew Cuomo, attempting to dry off his boyfriend’s nutsack… 
 Sounds like it MIGHT be actual wind...? 
 But- it might not be NATURAL wind. 

 Nah, cause it might be Andrew “Don't Touch Me, Grandpa” Cuomo … trying to dry off his buddy’s nutsack that he 
 just had in his mouth… that’s what they do and I refer to this level of douchebaggery as… “Censorship”

 Facebook, Nfrastructure, Google, all of these companies play a pivotal role in mass censorship of users data and
 opinion sharing… Though, I believe to VARYING DEGREES. I had this theory a LONG time ago, that perhaps the reason 
 why MANY of my posts, or things that I write or share…? 

 MAYBE, it is constantly JUDGED by some nutsack dryer breath grade censorship… and that the mediums in which 
 Facebook or Google in general, they're all curtailed according to whoever the fuck feels like running the show. 

 So if MARK ZUCKERBERG wants to SELL FACEBOOK'S USER DATA to CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA...? 
 Well, who the FUCK is gonna STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT...?

 Theodore Roosevelt, that's who.
 I wish I knew of a better way to say this, but… it’s not a REAL look into the opinions or ideas that people 
 have, when the platform AGGRESSIVELY censors SOME people, or even goes so far as to hire a team of HACKERS to use
 a program like (ARCHIMEDES https://youtu.be/QP25FbNhakQ), or even to be a general, all-around fuckface that uses
 (AFTER MIDNIGHT/ASSASSIN https://youtu.be/LYVUMLpofWg) (BSOD https://youtu.be/40sQXpVh_8Y), or just LIMITING MY
 COMMENTS ON THE PLATFORM LIKE THIS (CENSORSHIP https://youtu.be/Jmq4yBqGhTs).

 Because, I have seen wildly fluctuating sets of data for different parts of (the last 4 years). 
 In fact, I have meticulously watched the activity of my content, and I can see that people have been fucking 
 with it the entire time. Wanna know why people fuck with MY posts, social media content, or reputation...? 

 It's because I am manipulating CERTAIN PEOPLE that have no fear of being shot to death.
 They like to CONTAIN me because they like to play GOD.
 But eventually, ALL of those people who have this line of reasoning will inevitably be shot to death in a violent
 manner. That probably sounds rather EXTREME, right...?

 Well, the measures that these people have gone, to CONTAIN or RESTRICT my FREEDOMS and RIGHTS...?
 Is akin to them having already violently killed me. I'm not being hyperbolic at all, these people have attempted
 to murder me already, and they're not just gonna stop at ALMOST murdering me. Nah. 

 They're gonna DISILLUSION nearly EVERYONE I KNOW, and make me out to be some scapegoat or psycho... 
 But the thing is, these people are psychotic, for thinking that they're gonna get away with almost killing me.

 As for FACEBOOK, if you're like ME and you make a post, it is graded.
 Even if it causes MARK ZUCKERBERG to laugh his ass off...? 
 He will make damn certain that other people can't see it.

 He might even sell some of my material to some other company that has COOL, RESPECTABLE PEOPLE that wind up
 building an entire SKIT or SHOW, based around MY IDEAS that I've posted.

 If it sucks, it STILL isn’t shown to other people. 
 So, it just sits there, unseen by anyone else.
 People that go to my profile MIGHT see it then…?
 But they're not gonna get the impression that I have more experience than MARK ZUCKERBERG does...
 ...at building websites. https://web.archive.org/web/20220000000000*/planetquake.com/bfg20k (← 2001)

 Or configuring network devices, or basically anything with a computer where you need TALENT, and you do something
 PRODUCTIVE...? Because, I have a FELONY on my record from 2002. So that is what put me in this position. But also,
 my father was murdered when I was 10 years old. 

 These things are laughed about by people like MARK ZUCKERBERG and his buddies in the ASHKENAZI, they like the 
 idea of spiritual warfare, but the problem is that I am more intelligent than this motherfucker and it pisses him
 off that I ALWAYS FIND SOME WAY TO PISS HIM OFF EVEN MORE.

 Wanna know why...?
 It's because I wrote about how I think he should go to prison over CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA.
 However, that has evolved WAYYYYYY past that.

 My material has been being censored on a platform that goes around telling people that it is a PUBLIC ENTITY.
 FACEBOOK is NOT a public entity, nor is it really a PUBLIC FORUM, either.

 People are morons and they think that it is, and they ALSO think that some of the shit I write VIOLATES 
 COMMUNITY STANDARDS... so for instance, if I say the word “FUCK”, then, that is a swear word.

 That... is essentially against FACEBOOK COMMUNITY LAW.
 You're not ALLOWED to say the word FUCK at all, if you want people to think you have any common public decency.
 Nope. Fuck you dude. You said the word “FUCK” on FACEBOOK, and EVEN THOUGH you have to be OLDER THAN 13 TO HAVE A
 FUCKING ACCOUNT...? Doesn't matter. Children could STILL wind up seeing it.

 But, if some hot bitch says the word FUCK and ALSO posts a picture of her in her bathing suit...?
 That's ALLOWED. Wanna know why...? She's a hot bitch that said something erotic with the WAY that SHE said FUCK.

 When I said it, it was just fuckin' annoying, and it violated community standards.
 When SHE said it...? It gave MARK a reason to start cranking on his pud...? 
 Then he jizzed right into some potting soil... cause he's trying to go green with his greenthumb capabilities.

 /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

 Mark : Gotta be more considerate of the environment, dude.
        Plants need protein, too.

 \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

 Look, I've gotten MORE than a FEELING, that my FACEBOOK CONTENT or POSTS doesn’t just show up by itself on other
 people's NEWS FEEDS. Because, if you insult a dude who made a fortune off of selling data to CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA,
 then you're goin' right into the PROBLEMATIC USAGE category, and then you're REAL fucked, dude.

 So, here’s the thing… spent the better part of the last (4 years) INTENTIONALLY writing, and checking to see if
 this was the case. I just ACCUMULATE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE. If I can get a single post on Scott Salvadores page to 
 hit a certain number of comments...? 

 Then POPULARITY NOR ENGAGEMENT has NOTHING to do with the CONTENT I POST or UPLOAD having its EXPOSURE LIMITED.
 What my content does, is… proves that Mr Salvadore could be the most popular kid in all of history, but if he 
 has to have his friends assist him in censoring me, or like, just being an overall pain in the ass that abuses 
 this ability to make someone MORE INTERESTING than SCOTT (such as myself) from being MORE POPULAR and/or MORE 
 RICH than him/his family…
 Then that is the PERFECT PLAN, and it is what I'd do if I had a SMALL DICK and the last name SALVADORE.
 Because, there's NO WAY that ANYBODY would EVER KNOW... that a casually placed insult by MICHAEL COOK, was SO
 ACCURATE, that it caused some popular little rich boy to get SO UPSET WITH HIMSELF... that he just, paid MARK 
 to get me to SHUT THE HELL UP.
 But, that's why the American colonists shot a lot of BRITISH SOLDIERS to death in 1776...

 I'm not gonna keep writing about SCOTT SALVADORE because I think he's just a low ranking moron that somehow
 knew someone POWERFUL and COOL, and THEY thought that I was just being a real ASSHOLE, and then they kept eyes
 on me... and then I eventually started WINNING PEOPLE OVER, with my written material.

 They kept hiring a new crew of people to watch me all the time, but I kept causing the people who watched me,
 to fuckin laugh their asses off... Once a new person starts LAUGHING at what I'm writing...? Well, fuck.
 THEN, it's time to ship them off to some other project and get someone else with no sense of humor to watch me.

 But, the process kept repeating itself, and the process has cost these rich powerful people A LOT OF FUCKIN 
 MONEY... I'm not exaggerating. I have probably TANKED these people billions of dollars already.
    
 Anyway, I want to get back to the technology based police officers that should already exist, but they don’t yet…
 These technology cops… they wouldn’t need to even drive around either.

 Wasting taxpayer resources on vehicles that just float around on gasoline, when they could be solar/battery 
 powered instead… Wouldn’t need a company like NYSEG to give free power to T-Mobile/AT&T when everything has its 
 own solar panels and batteries… 
 So, this right here, would eliminate the need to have utility bills… 
 Sure, it causes people to generate less revenue… but the thing is, a lot about revenue is a lie, just look at the 
 US NATIONAL DEBT, sitting pretty at a real cool `$30T. That's because DEBT and REVENUE are being COMBINED and the 
 DEBT just continues to be LARGER than the REVENUE...? 

 That's why it keeps rising. Nothing anybody can do about it.

 Realistically, if NYSEG and T-Mobile get free power… who’s generating the most profit there?
 The answer is, both companies are ripping everyone off.
 Not even remotely kidding.
 I try to curtail the talk about eliminating the concept of ‘money’... because… it is easy for these dickheads to 
 just forget to turn the meter on, because… they aren’t paying each other anything at all… are they.

 The problem with transmission of power over power lines, is that power gets dissipated by about 80% over the     
 infrastructure… generating a lot of wasted heat and power. The transformers have to crank the voltage or amperage 
 back up after every X feet, which is why the traditional telephone pole approach works here.
 However, batteries and solar panels could reduce the carbon footprint quite immensely… as well as eliminate the
 need for people to be dependent on an energy grid where the GRID ITSELF uses 80% of the fucking power.
 Combine that with LoS technologies for fiber optics, and you could have an infrastructure that works cohesively, 
 in order to combat wasted heat or energy. An example of where they use other techniques of ‘biodiversity’ to help 
 condition the surrounding air/combat wasted heat/energy, is in Germany… where they use these natural habitats that
 exist on rooftops, that have plants/greenhouse moisture which helps to reduce dependence on air conditioning.

 (When I start to talk in my EDUCATIONAL mindset, this pisses MARK off even more cause he LEARNS stuff from me.)
 The greenhouse effect, is an extraordinary thing to use as an advantage, because then you’re running off of 
 operations that normally take place separately, and you’re integrating the way in which these systems complement 
 each other, to increase the efficiency of the entire system…
 In other words, it is similar to an exponent over a number. 
 When amplifying a number, the number that is amplified is the base, and the amplification factor is the exponent.
 In this case, the building being engineered to just be a building, it is the base.
 Adding a greenhouse full of plants that would ordinarily convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into oxygen and 
 water vapor… then what factors must be considered to get the best zero-sum impact on the environment?
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(7,"Shaping the Question",@"
Sometimes learning how to shape the question takes a while to figure out.
The real question is… could plants be used to make better fiber optic systems?
The answer is, “Yes, they can.”
The problem is, lots of rich guys fucking hate that idea, because it'd make em less rich. 
I don't want to throw them ALL into this camp, but I'm certain that some RICH PEOPLE act like TROOPER RUFFAS.

And, it means they might actually have to work a lot fucking harder than they ever did before… 
Might not be a consistent case, but it’s definitely an observation I’ve made.
Perhaps you want to come right out of the gate, and explain the final end goal of the cop badge guy who’s 
NOW familiar with the technology…
People have to ask “Don’t we have that already…?”
The answer is, yeah, but they think I’m nuts…
Prior to the last 18 months, never saw myself as a ‘genius’…
However, starting to think that maybe I have been all this time, and didn’t know it
Because... I couldn’t possibly be correct about all of the things I’ve said… unless I am… right? (← FALLACY)
So… if there IS a way that I could possibly be correct about all of the things I’ve said… and then people that 
say “There's NO WAY…” etc. Well, those people just sound dumb.

How dumb...?
“Oh. Putting a screen door on a submarine, would be a FANTASTIC idea”-dumb.
“So what, if the submarine gets flooded...? It'd be a REALLY COOL way, for it to flood.”-dumb.
(^ That's how dumb)

Also, my amateur detective skills detected something that any good cop that actually follows these things called 
LEADS would’ve ALSO found… those things are called CLUES. I'm like friggen Dick Tracy, dude... Just gonna get 
right in people's faces and show them the LEADS, and the CLUES... and if they get pissed? Oh well.
Now look, do I want to bash actual good cops that kick a lot of ass? Nah bro. 
I don’t like letting a bunch of good cops feel like they gotta get MAD over the fact that I made a habit of 
badmouthing LAW AVOIDANCE OFFICERS like TROOPER RUFFAS… he's not a good cop all across the board. He might impress
SOME people when they're like some HOT BITCH, or something...? But- he's not that impressive when it comes to guys
like me who have a rather THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING of PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION.

People called me nuts at every place I went to for help... They've never heard of JULIEN ASSANGE or EDWARD SNOWDEN.
That means that calling me crazy is what morons who don't know any better, will do. So I either got super unlucky, 
and met up with some morons at EVERY place I went to… 

Or perhaps I'm just a genius, and I piss people off by being a smartass all the time.
Maybe people didn’t know I (WON/TIED for FIRST PLACE with AMY BATEMAN) in the 4th grade science fair… 
MAYBE, they don't know that I ran circles around Dwayne Coonradt for the 3+ years I worked at COMPUTER ANSWERS. 
MAYBE, they don't really care if people lie to them about the news, or police reports, or that serial killers are
in town using ADVANCED TECHNOLOGICAL EXPLOITS to STEAL PEOPLE'S MONEY and that I'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING THAT and it's
ALMOST GOTTEN ME KILLED a number of times...
MAYBE... they don't know I’m working on a program that protects people from these atrocities.

If I told them that this program will OFFLOAD a lot of the work that the POLICE do, without needing to be paid 
for it… they may just be in total disbelief “Wow, that sounds TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.” 

Well, there's another explanation for it. Many of the police officers that currently get paid to perform LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, they're not performing LAW ENFORCEMENT, they're performing LAW AVOIDANCE. That's why THOSE cops 
fuckin' suck ass at LAW ENFORCEMENT. Thus, people rarely ever take me seriously... that some LAW AVOIDANCE 
OFFICERS have been attempting to kill me. Hence, why I originally wrote this fuckin' document, and then (2) years
later, I've decided to EXPAND upon it, as it is a subject that I talk about in my BOOK.
Maybe people they didn’t see the FUN involved, in whether a REAL billionaire REALLY BUILT a CYBERNETIC BIRD, which
was developed by a DARPA Project...

They didn’t say those words, but not a single place took me seriously.
Which means that the billionaire has made a thing that I fucking know what it is, but… 
…no one else fucking does… 

Because… if I were a billionaire I would also make something that nobody would fucking believe was a thing that 
was made… which is why I'm fairly certain that I've been in the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY spotlight for some 
time now. Hence, why the person who sent this bird… …has my adamant fuckin’ respect… 

…cause sometimes I don’t even believe the evidence or the story… 
…almost wanna say “Touche you real smart bastard(s)… touche…”

But if I'm smart enough to detect something that, even if I tell people or record evidence of it...
...people will FUCKIN IMMEDIATELY DOUBT IT IS WHAT I KNOW IT IS...
...then the disguise works perfectly.

It's not fooling me, but they gain enjoyment from knowing that I fuckin' definitely know this thing is an advanced
surveillance project. Then again, I would've never discovered it NOR speculated it's existence, if they didn't say
“Hello”.

It seemed like a mysterious, other-worldly idea, for these men to ask me WHY a fucking (cybernetic/robot) bird 
would just magically seem like a perfect idea to talk about… OH YES… Because of DARPA. 

It’s called the (DARPA/Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), where they make some robots, bro. 
I've seen a number of these videos where they have the technology to exhibit MIND CONTROL over a FLYING BUG.
To say that they can't apply the same concepts to exhibit MIND CONTROL over a BIRD, or CYBERNETIC IMPLANTS in
a BIRD...? I think that's more realistic than saying it's ALIEN BASED. But still, talking about it is gonna piss
off a bunch of people that were never INTELLIGENT ENOUGH nor OBSERVANT ENOUGH to detect something so 
CLEVERLY HIDDEN. And thus, they will accuse me of being PSYCHOTIC, rather than to STUDY the RECORDINGS I made.

They’ve been doing it for a while. So, I’m not that fuckin nuts.
I sent an email to Boston Dynamics many years ago when I first saw their Atlas robot, looks like a terminator, 
sort of… I've even shown my kids these videos. Boston Dynamics was purchased by Google/Alphabet I believe, but
BEFORE that, they had a few different versions of this thing. 

Atlas - Humanoid
Mad Cat - Jaguar/Cheetah 
Big Dog – Cow
Flea – Not based on an animal, gets through the most tight places possible.

So, when I talk about robots…? 
I’m not oblivious as the police I went to, for help… 
Maybe they don’t even know what DARPA is yet. 
Maybe I should send them a Wikipedia link, just as a portion of evidence...
Anyway, all of them… thought I was actually nuts. 
Not a single fuckin' one of them thought to themselves… 
“Maybe this guy isn’t fuckin' crazy... I’m just having a hard time believing the story.”
Well, no shit.

Usually, the thing that separates something that's HARD TO BELIEVE from BELIEVABLE...?
Is this stuff called EVIDENCE, or PRESENCE.

EVIDENCE is essentially a COPY of recorded PRESENCE.
PRESENCE is basically like WITNESSING something FIRST HAND.

People SHOULD normally ask to see the EVIDENCE of a hard to believe thing…? 
But… I would've failed at the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY academy for sure, because...
People don't fuckin' CARE about EVIDENCE of something COOL, or whatever...
Not unless THEY stumble across it BEFORE you ask to show it to them.
If THEY don't run across the EVIDENCE first-hand...?

They'll literally give you a middle finger, and say “You're a waste of life, hope you burn in hell for eternity.”
Not hyperbolizing that, but the WORDS they use will sound like “I love you.”

It doesn’t seem like a single one of them stopped to think that REVIEWING my EVIDENCE would be a good idea.
Even the SOLDIERS at STRATTON AIR NATIONAL GUARD, never thought about this...
Suppose that had I went straight to actual professionals down in Langley Virginia...? 
Ones that would say “Yes” to a question such as, “Would you like to see the evidence?”… 
WELL... I didn't think of that.

Suppose this thing would’ve been seen then and there by these 3 police officers (Sheriffs), if my 911 calls 
weren't subjected to a TELEPHONY DENIAL OF SERVICE...? Maybe they would've been impressed.

But, even still, rather than involving the surveillance footage of either location… of these (2) gay dudes trying 
to KILL me, I was caught between something that I believe was a REALLY COOL CYBERNETIC BIRD/DRONE, and (2) gay 
dudes who's (mom/dad) bought them a dangerous software application called (PEGASUS/PHANTOM)... 

...and they were trying to kill me... 
And, I'm pretty sure that the police were involved in the murder attempt.

So, which story will these dudes consider...?

Well, what you’re left with is that professionals are supposed to ask to see the evidence... but both of those 
stories sound rather difficult to believe already. They're not even gonna ask “What makes you believe that these
(2) dudes who were SUPPOSEDLY trying to killa ya, gay...? I mean, were they gay looking...? Or, sounded gay...?
Were they like, stroking each others dick or somethin...? How do YOU know that they were gay...?”

At a bare minimum, somebody COULD'VE asked me those questions, ya know...?
Not to turn me away, and immediately say “No (2) gay guys were tryin' to kill ya... You're nuts, pal.”
Professionals don’t do that. 
Only lazy cops like TROOPER RUFFAS, or MESSINES do that.
So far… met a lot of lazy cops.

If anyone attempts to argue with you about this, they’re not LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS.
They may be any other profession in the WORLD, OR... LAW AVOIDANCE PROFESSIONALS.

So, if someone has EVIDENCE, you should probably CONSIDER COLLECTING IT...
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(7,"Leavey Synopsis (May 31st, 2020)",@"
As for what I wrote about TROOPER LEAVEY a couple of years ago...?
Sometimes, you’ll get a guy like Mr. Leavey who says “How long do you think I’ve been on the force?”, because 
he’s implying that his “time” on the force, means that his gut tells him it’s not a thing to be worried about… 

The typical cop that might miss a detail that I, some fuckin rookie that’s still wearing diapers in terms of 
cop-hood… Pointed out…? But… maybe Mr. Leavey thought I was smoking crack rocks (and other people too). 
So, wasn’t accurate, leads weren’t worth investigating… 

This is the thought process that most police officers (unfortunately) have, and it is the reason why I have to
constantly remind them that “I may just be more intelligent than you are, sir.”

(As for what I was able to determine from later engagements...?
I think TROOPER LEAVEY was just DISTRACTED, and I hadn't formed my opinions or observations CLEARLY ENOUGH...
...to convey them to other people, quite yet. I'm going to CONTINUE with the rhetoric I wrote 05/31/20, because
IT STILL APPLIES TO SOME OF THE OTHER OFFICERS)
As such, despite my best effort, the guy who’s been on the force for a hell of a lot longer than me… 
…missed a detail that led to a break in a historical case involving:
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
| missing people | identity theft | obstruction of justice | corporate espionage | racketeering | extortion |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
So, despite Mr. Leavey telling me that he’d been on the force for X number of years… it’s a fucking totally 
irrelevant metric that doesn’t have any scope or bearing on the laziness factor involved in not checking these 
CLUES or LEADS that I practically spoon fed him... (Obviously recanting this statement toward SHAEMUS LEAVEY)
Thing is, a real professional team of cops, they could’ve found all the stuff I did... had they been doing the 
actual job they get paid to do… (LAW ENFORCEMENT) which is NOT the job they say they do… because it's (LAW 
AVOIDANCE). Because, maybe they SAY they never leave their cruisers running at the station… 

But, here's 2 videos of it happening.
_______________________________________________________________________________
| 05/23/20 | CP Public Safety Building NYSP #1 | https://youtu.be/nD-TC0OEKjc |
| 05/25/20 | CP Public Safety Building NYSP #2 | https://youtu.be/oJT0WG-CaE0 |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
They may say “it won’t happen again.” 
But then, next day, same thing… 
Of course, they get mad. 

Because, you caught LAW AVOIDANCE OFFICERS being LAZY and LYING to you...
(2) videos of this shit happening..? (0) positive responses…
I could understand getting irritated with a ROOKIE who doesn't even have a BADGE, for asking too many questions… 
But, if LAW AVOIDANCE OFFICERS stopped doing the thing they're not supposed to be doing, LAW AVOIDANCE...
...and STARTED doing what they're SUPPOSED to be doing LAW ENFORCEMENT...

...then the ROOKIE with NO BADGE, won't come around to make guys like TROOPER RUFFAS look like a lazy 
incompetent bastard who just leaves the vehicle running at the station. 
That means someone who isn’t even a cop yet, made TROOPER RUFFAS look like a complete waste of everyone’s money.
But, the detail that continues to be left out is… 
I literally walked from Clifton Park, to Albany NY the other day… 
Because… I’m fairly certain that a lot of heroin overdoses are actually murders. 
And… someone in town is definitely doing this. 

This coronavirus situation is just a perfect opportunity to use as cover for a process in which a lot of people get
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
| beaten up while their | home is invaded | then get killed once they provide a deed, will, or whatever else… | 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Then hey… maybe someone knows how to change documents around, so that papers can continue to be filed, bills paid, 
credit paid… So, guys like (Goran/Astoia) Vucetic who ran the driving range for his whole life… guys like him
mysteriously go missing... (he's fine though)

Anyway, as far as the power situation… 
If the power to the cell phone tower is set to 0… then that means all of the phones would still ping as beacons… 
...the customers still have to pay the bill… and their power bill… so all these people that paid their bills are
getting killed, and then their phone that more than likely has access to all of their shit… such as email, 
Facebook, etc… now the killers can log in as them. 

Just, sign in as this person. 
Cause a phone that was taken from a body, can now be used to fake someone’s online status. 
It could even be used to continue paying bills, filling up for gas, buying food, groceries, online stores… 
silk road activity…
But hey, NOBODY TOOK ME SERIOUSLY ABOUT ANY OF THESE CLUES...
The fact that I have this theory, that there are serial killers that have police training… that are doing this…
Catricala video I uploaded, somehow… not accessible, because these police officers that tried to kill me have 
access to pulling the file that I just uploaded. COOL SHIT. (when they intercepted my GOOGLE DRIVE UPLOADS/FILES)

It’s like, evidence of attempted murder, CANT ACCESS IT CAUSE THEY PULLED IT BACK OFF… 
It’s called OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, LAW AVOIDANCE.
It’s a criminal offense to do such a thing when it is involved in a criminal investigation. 

This is the sort of thing that BCI would normally handle, but I really have gotten tired of asking cops for help… 
...and now my whole forehead and chest is peeling like a bastard because Clifton Park to Albany is a pretty long 
 hike to make in the middle of the day.
Anyway, a lot of people could already be dead… and nobody even knew… 
Because, if you are killed with your phone on you, then these guys can log into your Facebook as you for the rest of
time… So, when you see all of these people on Facebook… you have to question whether or not the person you knew that
lived across the street the whole time… Maybe they got taken out. And someone sold whatever to whoever, and they’re
living happily out in some other state where you more than likely will never go…
If a police officer says all of this, then… maybe it is always...
...the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them god… 
Even if they take this oath, and you have picture evidence of a thing a police officer attested to as true while 
under oath, but the evidence suggests otherwise… then, APPARENTLY... the evidence is FALSE EVIDENCE in every court 
of law I’ve ever been to… not sure why. (← I'm hyperbolizing that)
If you need evidence of such a thing, here’s a classic example of the exact opposite thing of justice taking place… 

Ms. Vero could’ve contacted Microsoft to determine if Precision Periodontics was wicked far behind on everything…
…updates, malicious files, [remote tunnels (Trojans) to Russia*], [credit cards being skimmed*]… 

All of the stuff that a dentist office should keep out of reach of people that don’t work at that building…? 
Just go ahead and make it available to the public, that's what the RED COLOR MEANS when MALWAREBYTES detects
a REMOTE ACCESS TROJAN on a network that's SUPPOSED to be SECURE for PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY. 
Things like that. 

(So, Eaglesoft and Patterson can blow me… *recant*) they should have an SQL syste...
...not a whole ‘put documents in folders that anyone can publicly access…’ (They had nothing to do with the WAY
their system was set up or inadequately prepared by a system engineer)

Maybe they didn’t realize how insecure it is, for 10 of the computers in the building to each have the username
“Admin” and password “Password”… Maybe BANKING INSTITUTIONS should do that too. Ya know...? 

Dentist office had 10 computers using the same credentials. 
The software would allow specific users, but, here’s a fun fact. 
All it could take is for one of these people to put a keylog on there, and then they have everybody’s login. 
Maybe, they didn’t see the thousands of infected files on the server that they tasked me with having to transfer 
to the new system that Computer Answers had built. Totally other story… but somewhat relevant...
Even if the dude deleted logs and reformatted everything at that office…? Well, each of those machines has a 
(UUID/digital signature). Every time you download an update from Microsoft, it is permanently kept on record, 
because they have to track where the updates go and if they are mutated at all… 

It might be a stretch to think that they exist 18 months later, but who knows. 
Main reason I started my own company was because Precision Periodontics wasn’t the first time I saw a business 
that had a lot of these tunnels called “trojans”.
They’re never anything less than an immediate threat.
Not the type of thing you’d want dozens of, on each machine in your network… (they didn't have dozens on EACH)
...
They have the records necessary that prove that I did the work that I stated was completed. 
But, then someone put the bad files right back where they were… because the BACKUP SYSTEM was AUTOMATICALLY
RESTORING BACKED UP INFECTIONS. Ah. That's the clincher right there.
Not 100% certain about what MS can/has to do, but they have some records which show the work that I did at that
building, (so do the FBI/NSA/CISA) and even on top of that, so would MALWAREBYTES. Anyway, if I know that Pavel 
didn’t touch the network, and neither did Spectrum because I changed the security options since the defaults 
were unsafe… was I asked any of these questions? No.
Pavel may be involved with Russians that play with their dicks all day watching a video of him pounding a bottle 
of vodka, and then jumping into a frozen river… Again. Bragging about doing such a stupid thing while he’s doing 
it… talking shit in half Russian, half English... getting out while continuing to brag about what the hell he just 
did… wiping himself off with a stupid ass towel talking the most smack talk anyone could ever do… 
...while bragging about what the hell he just did… 

- pounding a fuckin bottle of vodka to the face
- jumping into a frozen river
- talking shit about basically everyone in half Russian, half English
- bragging about it.
(^ Because it’s funny. He’s the type of dude who definitely does that, and would even admit it. Ask him.)
It doesn’t change the fact that he’s still an oblivious idiot. 
He might have friends who aren’t as oblivious, totally telling him what to do, and how long to do it… 
Maybe… Pavel sent these goons… cause he’s pissed off about how even years later after working for him… the sales
records I left behind still make his best attempt look like a kid that never grew out of wearing his favorite 
pull-ups. In other words, he makes a better hushin’ russian than a technology wizard… 
AKA, he’s too busy blowing somebody to answer the phone.
Suffice to say, all of these above situations…? 
They all lead to being constantly hyper-aware of my surroundings and I watch interactions a little more closely, 
and listen a little more closely as well… so when the police that work right now could easily say they don’t know 
the technology, that’s fine.
Eventually cops won’t ever say that because that’s what they’ll do… is know the technology. 
Like IDK, Judge Dredd or something… Roll around on his electronic floating Frankenstein Ferrari from the future … 
some Fifth Element type of taxicab/ship/whatever…
We could have that already. 
Only reason that we don’t is cause, flying cars aren’t a thing that we’ve mastered yet… 

Until the day that we could just land on the roof, leave the car there, no fucks given, get out… you’re not gonna
understand how obsolete pavement will be. And tires. And oil. Probably. Just a floating car. 

Never falls or anything… If it ever even thinks about trying to stall out…? 
It’ll still be floating there, saying “Nah, bruh.” It’ll defy the laws of physics…
This dude will be the average cop in the future, driving the type of car I just mentioned, who’s literally able 
to program themselves into a brand new wormhole that he just created to catch some bad guy real quick, program 
himself right back to where he’s gotta drop him off for prints and a mugshot… talk some shit to him before he 
takes a hike down to where bad guys go… and then bam. Locks him up for being a real lame ass prick… no problem.

These cops in the future that I just mentioned, they’re not the type of people that you want to just chill out 
in the vehicle with, while you’re scoping out targets and scanning with your radar… these cops might have to do 
that as a fallback when the detective work is in short supply.
But, suppose that the actual factual, top notch, technical advisory panel of badass assassin grade programming
directors that can calculate functions… suppose that is what it takes to be a Cyber Commando… like Rex Power Colt, 
from Far Cry III: Blood Dragon.
The game is a bit of an off discussion, but it's got some pretty good gameplay. 
I imagine that Far Cry is not far off from the type of game that I envision myself playing, at times… 
I would say, more like Metal Gear… but, it’s not a real apples to oranges comparison. 
Both games feature an attempt to create realistic open-world gameplay where you just go fuckin bonkers and shoot
whatever, and whoever, like a maniac would do.
Let me reel it back slightly, it’s not like the objective of the game is to lose your mind and go postal… 
…it’s just a side effect that happens to the character in the game, as well as you, in real life. 
The real objective is to collect some clues. 
You wanna try and figure out which evil bastard you have to go after… 
Each game is a new, more evil jerk than in the game before… supposedly anyway…
Each of these games involves taking a bunch of pictures, finding clues, telling people who the hell you are or 
what you want, it's… a tried and true recipe from each game in the series. 

So, naturally… if you want to take things up a few notches… you can’t go wrong with a game that revolves around 
the concept of Blood Dragons…
These things try to eat your face off a lot.
Sometimes, they’ll get ya. Sucks. They’re cool to look at, but … having to be a real prick to one…? 
…before you can really take a good look at this bastard…?
What type of heartless monster would not want to see more of the Blood Dragon before it tries to kill the player…? 
Not sure if they thought that part through…
These are the types of soldier-top-notch-badass-cops that will exist in the future… 
...ALWAYS familiar with the technology..? 

Never hesitates to tell a Blood Dragon to piss off, either.
Cause that's the story of a fuckin' top-notch cybercommando.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(7,"Excerpt [~] Jake Gunslinger",@"
Now I'll state it openly... Shaemus Leavey isn't exactly a cybercommando that goes around punching Blood Dragons
in the fuckin' face... Nah. The CLOSEST thing to an actual, bonafide cybercommando that comes even REMOTELY close
to Rex Power Colt...?

WELL... there's a Saratoga County Sheriff that goes by the name, Jake Gunslinger. 
He is by far, the COOLEST Saratoga County Sheriff that ever lived.

One day I was trying to boot my laptop, using Johan Arwidmark and Mykael Nystroms PSD tool modification to get my
laptop to boot again, but I needed a certain TOOL to make it work. 

For some reason, I went to Wits End next to the Clifton Park post office, and I was rummaging through my 
belongings trying to find this damn tool... this guy looks like somebody you might run into at Cracker Barrel...

Glasses. 
About 5'8". 
Real patient bastard, too. 
Doesn't like to swear, but he will if he has to.
When he gets done working, he  takes his wife out to go eat, and he'll still be in his uniform, so he throws a
coat over his uniform to blend in.

Dude might be leaving after having some dinner with his wife, might be ready to leave... but he is gonna be 
pretty miffed by the notion that I just, came into the dining hall and started rummaging around like I owned the
friggin place.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Jake : Hey, what the hell are you even doin there, dude...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

When I first met this guy, it was in Parkwood Plaza, but I couldn't remember him... 
Anyway, I start to get miffed in response to this guy, and I go on the offensive...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me   : Look, pal~! I'm trying to find a tool that I've got here somewhere, my laptop won't boot and Deployment 
       Bunny's modification sorta screwed up my boot partition...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Now, Jake Gunslinger hasn't made it apparent to me yet that he's not an ordinary civilian eating dinner with his 
wife at Wits End... Ohhhh no.

That's when he flips his jacket open slightly and then I see it plain as day, the Saratoga County Sheriff star. 
With his name etched on his shirt GUNSLINGER.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Jake : Now boy, you don't remember me, do ya...?
Me   : Well, no ... 
       Sorry if I snapped at ya, been pretty frustrated with all of these girls clothes all over the place.
       I dropped something and that's why I'm making a ruckus...
Jake : ...I can see that...
       ...Didn't know that's what the problem was, thought you were just being rude.
Me   : Nah man, look I'm sorry if I upset you or your wife.
       I'm just desperate to find this thing I dropped.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

So now, Jake understands why I'm making a ruckus, because... he would've been making a ruckus too, getting pissed 
about all the girls clothes all over the place TOO... cause if there's anything anybody can count on...? 
Girls like clothes. 
They will... make a god damn mess with their numerous clothes, sometimes.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Jake : *sighs* Dude... maybe I had ya all wrong.
Wife : What's going on...?
Jake : Babe, this guy wasn't causing trouble... 
       ...he's looking for something he dropped and there's a bunch of girls clothes all over the place...
Wife : Yeah, that is definitely evident...
Jake : *decides to sit down on a nearby couch* ...yeah I ran into this fellow before. 
       Right outside of Parkwood Plaza. 
       Ran into this kid a few times but only met him once. (← FLASHBACK)
       Thought he was just trying to cause trouble THEN, but- 
       ...he had a perfect reason to be acting the way he was...
Wife : Huh. Well, whaddya know...?
Me   : Well, sorry for upsetting you, sir.
Jake : Look kid... *starts writing his name on a piece of paper* ...you get into ANY TROUBLE AT ALL...? 
       Go ahead and call me, here's my number.
Me   : Jake Gunslinger 584-XXXX...?
Jake : *nods* That's right... might not be Rex Power Colt...?
       But- I don't play games dude, thought you were playing games... but I know an honest kid when I see one. 
       I know other cops and people are gonna give you a hard time... that's why I gave you my information.
Me   : Well, cool.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

And, that's the story of how I met the COOLEST Saratoga County Sheriff that ever lived.
This is a fictional story by the way... as far as I know, there's nobody named Jake Gunslinger, but the dream I 
had about him was SO REAL, that I had to make damn certain that he found his way into a story.

He seemed a lot like Deputy Kuhn, with a dash of Michael WHITEACRE or maybe Joshua Welch. 
Deputy Kuhn was the DARE Officer who I ran into at Stewart's somewhat recently, and he remembered me...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Kuhn : Michael Cook, SKANO ELEMENTARY, right...?
Me   : That's right...
Kuhn : *chuckles* Heh.
       You stayin' outta trouble there, Mr. Cook...?
Me   : *chuckles right back* Heh. 
       Nah man, not ME.
Kuhn : *chuckles* Heh. 
       *shakes his head* That's what I figured...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Deputy Kuhn didn't want to say it but I think he was miffed about something I wrote a couple years ago.
However, here's an advantage I have over most of the police and justice systems... 
I CAN STAND TO BE CORRECTED, and typically, THEY CANNOT.

I misunderstood some of the documents that my father left behind in his desk)box of documents.

Michael WHITEACRE has a similar story, he was at my house alongside SERGEANT MARK SHEEHAN on JUNE 19th, 2020... 
But he was ALSO the first police officer to approach me after I had distributed a letter on SEPTEMBER 3rd, 2020.
I actually ran into JUDGE JAMES HUGHES walking a beat around SHOPPERS WORLD PLAZA early SEPTEMBER 4th, 2020...
So I know for a fact that JAMES HUGHES knows EXACTLY what I was up to.

However, the document pissed off some people at a DAY CARE, and here's WHY...

The content of THAT letter was MEANT to get ATTENTION from SOMEBODY, and it just so happens that the DAY CARE being
PISSED OFF was the ONLY THING that managed to EVOKE ANYTHING HELPFUL from the COMMUNITY. It probably seems like a
COUNTER POINT... right...? However, MICHAEL WHITEACRE came to my house and SURE, he was ALSO rather MIFFED... 
...because he read the letter and while he even ADMITTED that he thought some of it was funny...? 

...he didn't think that leaving it at a day care where little kids go, was all that FUNNY or COOL.

The thing is, I think that's the problem is that I'm not doing any of these things to be COOL, I'm just ADDING 
HUMOR to the CONTENT to get people to READ it. Thus, DEPUTY WHITEACRE actually confronted me, and by god...? 

He had a conversation with me that went a lot like this...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Whiteacre : DUDE... you can't just go around taping things to people's doors~! 
            Especially if you're gonna say stuff like some dude at the FBI is a lazy cocksucker who clocks in at 
            9AM, and then at 901AM, has to grab a juice box and take a nap... cause that sounds like something a
            CHILD at a DAY CARE would do...
Me        : I know, right...? 
            How'd you find out about the letter, or that I wrote it...?
Whiteacre : Dude, cause some people at a DAY CARE got WICKED PISSED, and they called us... and, my god... 
            I know who *points* YOU are, dude. 
            You're the guy from Computer Answers.
Me        : That's right.
Whiteacre : *mortified* What the heck, dude...?!? 
            Those are little kids!
Me        : I obviously didn't leave them there for the little KIDS to read...
Whiteacre : Well, obviously... not every little kid is gonna be able to READ what you wrote. 
            Are you SERIOUS about this group of dirty cops that tried to kill ya...?
Me        : Yes.
Whiteacre : Well, holy shit, dude...
            *Stares at me for a moment*
Me        : Your team has been making some mistakes.
Whiteacre : Yeah we make mistakes, but we're not supposed to like, TELL people about that...
Me        : *eyebrows up*...which means you can stand to be corrected...?
Whiteacre : Right. 
            Just cause we're NOT friends, doesn't mean that we can't be FRIENDLY...
Me        : Alright. 
            Can you help me obtain records somehow...?
Whiteacre : So, you'll wanna speak to my supervisor, SERGEANT WELCH, you should talk to him.
Me        : Well, alright then cowboy, I guess that's what I'm gonna have to do.
Whiteacre : Man, people here in this town really do live in their own little world here, and they're NOT gonna have 
            the same sense of humor that you and I have...
Me        : Well, maybe that isn't necessarily the case.
Whiteacre : Nah, dude... people here are WAY different than everywhere else, they really live in their own little 
            bubble, sheltered from the rest of society it would seem...
Me        : I think there's a sinister reason for that, I don't think it has anything to do with people not having 
            a sense of humor.
Whiteacre : MAYBE... 
            Look dude, I understand where you're coming from. 
            Personally...? 
            If I were you I would try not to be so...
Me        : Obnoxious...?
Whiteacre : Well, I guess that word works... 
            I was thinking more like-
Me        : Boisterous...?
Whiteacre : ...what's that mean...?
Me        : Like, real blatant and loud-
Whitacre  : Yeah, *points* that.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Anyway, DEPUTY WHITEACRE is a good dude and earned himself some recognition by being an awesome cop that day. 
He may have thought I was being an asshole at first...? But the interaction yeilded a clue in my INVESTIGATION.

After speaking with HIM, I wound up speaking to SERGEANT WELCH, who talked with me later on.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Welch : Yeah, is this Michael Cook...?
Me    : Yep.
Welch : Hey, I got your message and was returning your call, how many I be of service...?
Me    : I'm trying to get the record for an incident that occurred on May 26th 2020 in front of the
        ZAPPONE dealership...
Welch : Yeah, I remember that, I was actually ON that call.
Me    : Really...?
Welch : Yeah, I showed up after SCHELLING and KAPLAN out in front of ZAPPONE.
Me    : Well, holy fuck dude... 
        I have been looking ALL OVER for that record.
Welch : Yeah...? 
        Well, I can tell ya, straight from the horses mouth... 
        ...that record DEFINITELY exists, alright. 
        Cause... 
        *taps chest* I was on that incident.
Me    : Noted, sir.
Welch : So, let me look it up for ya, you got a piece of paper and a pen...?
Me    : Yep.
Welch : Alright, so... 
        ...it was SCSO-2020-027797. (← It was actually SCSO-2020-028501, but SCHELLING was on BOTH tickets.)
Me    : Alright cool. 
        So, how do I obtain that record...?
Welch : You gotta contact the records department, and then email them a copy of your ID as well as the thing 
        you're looking for, which to be clear, is SCSO-2020-027797. 
Me    : Well, holy hell dude. 
        You're a real helpful, Sergeant Welch~!
Welch : Hey brother, just, keeping it real here at the County Sheriff's Office.
        And you didn't hear this from me, but there are PLENTY of careless morons who work here...
Me    : I'm aware of that.
        I have an incident with Family Court now, and it all stems from the guy you were with that didn't 
        collect the evidence from my device...
Welch : Yeah, yeah... you'll have to take it up with SCHELLING, which is probably not what you wanted to hear...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Because, he was right, there are plenty of careless morons who work at:
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
| 6010 County Farm Road, Ballson Spa, NY 12020 | 40 McMaster Street, Ballston Spa, NY 12020 |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
...but he was ALSO correct about how since SCHELLING was the first responder, he's the guy I'd have to go to.
So, if the first responder chooses to perform LAW AVOIDANCE, instead of LAW ENFORCEMENT...? 

Then, that first responder can protect the criminals who tried to murder me, plain and simple.
Which is why you need somebody like JAKE GUNSLINGER on your side.

These (3) guys, Kuhn, Whiteacre, and Welch...? 
They're real, and they are SOMEWHAT VERBATIM conversations that I had with each of them, which means CLOSELY
ACCURATE. As for Whiteacre and Welch, they occurred, at or about SEPTEMBER 4th, 2020.

Because, AFTER I spoke with JAMES HUGHES, MICHAEL WHITEACRE eventually came to my house, and then he directed
me to speak to his superior, SERGEANT JOSHUA WELCH, and WELCH told me to I submit my RECORDS REQUEST for EVERY

RECORD WITH MY NAME ON IT, which I submitted on SEPTEMBER 4th, 2020.

When the records department responded with the records on September 8th or 9th, 2020...? 
Well, the record that SERGEANT WELCH gave me, was for the WRONG INCIDENT, though it was PRETTY DAMN CLOSE.

The incident that he gave me was for when SCOTT SCHELLING responded to the call that was made by the people at 
Stratton Air National Guard, AKA S.A.N.G.

The record I was LOOKING FOR which contained by ALIBI for the ARREST that JAMES LEONARD had DJ THOMPSON arrest me 
for ZACHARY KARELS lame-ass kayak strap INSTEAD OF the PHONE LINE... (MICHAEL MARTIN was not the one to ARREST nor
PROCESS me at the HALFMOON SHERIFF SUBSTATION where JUSTICE JOE FODERA or KEVIN TOLLISEN work.

MARTIN ONLY DID THE PAPERWORK. JAMES LEONARD ORDERED THEM to: stapled an oral admission with the WRONG FUCKING 
TIME on it, and the REASON WHY LEONARD HAD THEM DO THAT, was to COMMIT OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. (← THATS A CRIME)

What I mean specifically is that I EVENTUALLY got the record I was looking for after practically SHAKING DOWN 
Captain Jeffrey Brown on FEBRUARY 1ST, 2020. The CORRECT record was SCSO-2020-028501.

Now, by this point, Fred Rench had already gotten me an ACOD and SARAH SCHELLINGER made it OBVIOUS to me, that she 
thought I was FABRICATING shit out of thin air. But, nope. Wasn't doing that. 

What ACTUALLY happened, was that some <unspecified. named LISA MENTES decided to write a series of FALSE 
STATEMENTS about me to have my children taken away AFTER I WAS ALMOST MURDERD on MAY 26th, 2020 and THEN, 
my MOTHER ALSO decided to write a FALSE STATEMENT to SOCIAL SERVICES resultant to RICHARD TODD LOEBER's SHITTY, 
RUSHED, 5 minute misdiagnosis.

At the end of the day, I have every reason to call a guy like Jake Gunslinger, and ask the man for his help. 
He knows that the job is going to be tough. 
He knows he's gonna have to outdo MICHAEL ZURLO at being the COOLEST Saratoga County Sheriff that ever lived...

And my god...? JAKE GUNSLINGER is gonna be VERY UNDERSTANDING of how fuckin' pissed off I am, too. Cause.
He'd be the FIRST fuckin' dude to join my militia and start holding people accountable. 
That's why he gave me his name and number.

When I say the word EXPERT, what I mean is, I will literally, at the drop of a dime, or if someone suggests this...
...I will GO TO THE APPLE STORE, and ask to speak to the most experienced person at that store...
...and I will flat out tell that person:

“I will fucking DESTROY your ass for the rest of the entire day, at:
_______________________________________________________________________________________
| DIAGNOSING | SELLING | REPAIRING | → ANY FUCKING DEVICE THAT YOU HAVE IN THIS STORE |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
...WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PROVE THAT…?”

At that point…? They may start laughing, and that’s fine. 
Then, I have to whip out the VIDEOS where I’m literally tearing apart iPhones back in 2018 for Asurion...
...right BEFORE I started working with some tiny-dicked douchebag named Michael DeGioralmo from Team Tech...
(Apple iPhone Repair - https://youtu.be/i3qn1CZ-5WM)

...THEN, they will probably stop fucking laughing and start to feel nervous...
...THEN, I’ll show them the interview I had with (Andrew Banas regarding SmartTV’s - https://youtu.be/bPdWt7kcd3M)...
...THEN, ALL of the staff at the Apple Store will realize, I am a LOT MORE EXPERIENCED THAN THEY ARE... 
...and that I managed the COMPUTER ANSWERS STORE IN CLIFTON PARK...
...and that I have experience doing ALL of their jobs. (← THAT IS BECAUSE I AM AN ACTUAL 100% LEGITIMATE EXPERT)

Pretty fuckin cool to see what the device these serial killers targeted with PEGASUS/PHANTOM, isn’t it...?
This device right here was an accessory to a murder attempt that SCSO MICHAEL ZURLO FACILITATED.

By the way, it’s the same god damn phone that I used to record 2x videos of the NEW YORK STATE POLICE leaving 
multiple cruisers running idle, unattended, outside of the CLIFTON PARK PUBLIC SAFETY BUILDING.

They’re not supposed to do that. Here’s the police hacking my device on 05/24/20 -> https://youtu.be/i88AJb_5zY4

As for the conversation I had with SHAEMUS LEAVEY (a NYSP TROOPER whose computer I once did work for) on 
05/27/20 ~0900...? Well, [this conversation occurred BEFORE SCSO JAMES LEONARD filed*]:

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Here is how that conversation went...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Me     : I believe that a serial killer is going house to house, killing people.
         I think 80% of the people up the street here, *points up Paddock Turn* have been killed.
         I keep seeing this one dude driving a red SUV that has the license plate “SP-543”.
Leavey : What makes you say that...?
Me     : Well, like I mentioned to the trooper girls you were with yesterday, I think they’re using COVID as 
         a cover to go house to house...
         ...so when I see pollen or dust accumulating on vehicles...
         ...or curtains in the same exact position for days or weeks at a time...
         ...I start to think that someone was killed in that house.
Leavey : So like, people leaving their air conditioners running, or lights on...
         ...the power company is just gonna not disconnect the service...?


/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

I was still conceptualizing my theories, and I’m fairly certain that people in our society don’t realize that
I spit out a lot of theories, and people will assume I must be insane because they’re stupid... they hear me 
say something that sounds fucked up and goes against all of the “ASSUMED KNOWLEDGE” that they have, that they
may keep it to themselves, or they may say “You’re fuckin’ crazy, dude.” However, the reason that those people
do that is because they’re a lot less intelligent and/or observant than I am, and they rarely ask questions.

And that’s ok. I really don’t care if people think I’m an asshole anymore, because trying to be nice to people
is a complete waste of time if they’re automatically jumping to conclusions, because they’re insulting my 
intelligence when they make ASSUMPTIONS rather than SPECULATIONS. And, most people are thrilled to do this.

I was rather certain that NYSEG was giving people free power, but it was such a MINISCULE thing I discovered in
the middle of investigating problems that are FAR LARGER and MORE COMPLICATED.

So for instance, the multiple pictures and videos that I took on my 35th birthday, some of those pictures were of
BOTH cell towers on SOLAR DRIVE, in HALFMOON NY. 

One of the cell towers had a meter that said 0.00KwH.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

NYSEG : YEAH, UH, THE METERS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT...? 
        Cause like, they’ll FLASH OFF, and perform a RESET.
        THEN they’ll say 0.00KwH for a SPLIT SECOND... 
        THEN they’ll FLASH OFF AGAIN...
        THEN, THAT is when it will show the CORRECT METER READING.
Me    : Oh, ok fuckface. 
        Glad you could give me and everyone else an update, 
        However, here’s the problem you fuckin moron...
        The video I recorded is showing a totally different story.
        So maybe you should shut the fuck up, and go back to school.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

When the meter says 0.00KwH for multiple seconds in one of the pictures I took...? 
Well fuckface, my phone had a mode where it was taking pictures AND videos at the same time. 
So like, ALL of the pictures I took on SOLAR DRIVE...? They were, in fact, VIDEO FILES~!
So, I was able to catch the meter reading saying a stagnant 0.00KwH, for, check it out...
...multiple seconds it was just saying 0.00KwH. THAT MEANS THE METER IS NOT CONNECTED, OR RUNNING, OR OTHERWISE, 
IN WORKING ORDER. Here’s what it ULTIMATELY means... If someone is attached to the grid, it is still drawing the 
power, and that power is STILL BEING PAID FOR BY SOMEBODY ELSE. 

So, that means that the PRICE OF THE LOAD is EVENLY DISTRIBUTED to EVERY OTHER ADJACENT RESIDENCE OR BUSINESS.
In the simplest terms possible...? It means that other people don’t realize they’re paying EXTRA for that.
Pretty cool, huh...? 

To add insult to injury, if the COVID lockdown made it practically impossible for SOME people to pay THEIR cell 
phone bill...? Oh well. Their service probably got disconnected, for not paying the cell phone bill.

Meanwhile, if they ask their power company buddy to hold off on charging them for the energy bill...?
That’s when NYSEG will say “Sure dude, here ya go.”
The reason why people have a hard time believing this, is mainly because most people are gullible idiots.

Does that make the situation pretty fucking clear for other people...? Yeah...? 
Sorry if I’m coming across as a real ASSHOLE, but guess what...? 
Telling people doesn’t really change anything. Nah. Cause they’ll probably write me off as if I don’t know what 
I’m talking about, when the fact of the matter is, they’re asking people that don’t know what the fuck they’re
talking about OR, they’re LYING. That’s what NYSEG does.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Me     : ...it’s why I called out a couple guys when I went to NYSEG yesterday.
Leavey : You mean, GrayBar...?
Me     : I was never at GrayBar…
Leavey : [THAT’S NOT THE STORY WE WERE TOLD*], somebody called from GrayBar. (* KEY WORDS that indicate DECEPTION)
Me     : Maybe you should go to NYSEG and check the SECURITY CAMERAS, because I was not AT GrayBar.
         I was at NYSEG, reaming out some 6’4” lookin’ dude with a red hat on wearing glasses...
         ...as well as some other dude who was checking his email at his cubicle talking to this dipshit.
Leavey : Dude, you do realize that when people call things in, they’re ALWAYS accurate, right...?
         People don’t just make shit up when they call things in...
         It’s just, how it is...
Me     : Yeah, cause like, if I’m some asshole at NYSEG that knows some dude took pictures and videos of
         power meter readings that clearly showcase that I, the guy who owns NYSEG, is giving away free power 
         to a cell phone tower...?
         Well, what I COULD do, is have my buddy at GrayBar call the police. 
         Because, if I’m gonna be a cocksucker that indiscriminately screws people over...? 
         I wouldn’t stop at JUST giving free power away to certain people, nah. 
         I’d just keep using that strategy to be the biggest fuckin queer that ever lived.
Leavey : Alright, so you said you have evidence or proof, what kind of proof are we talkin’ here...?
Me     : Videos.
Leavey : What kind of videos do you have...?
Me     : Well, I have this (1) particular video of a couple dudes that I think were using software that allows
         someone to remotely access somebody’s smartphone, that’s more important than the power scam.
         The COOL thing is, I don’t even have SERVICE on this device.
Leavey : Let me see what you got...
Me     : *starts playing IMG_0647.MOV* 
Leavey : Alright, well...    
Me     : So, look, I realize that all this shit sounds nuts, but my THEORY, is that 80% of the people that
         live up the street MIGHT’VE been killed, because these (2) dudes were following me the other night,
         they tried to run me over during the AUDIO RECORDING I UPLOADED AT COMPUTER ANSWERS at about 1125PM.
         THEN, unbeknownst to me, they were actually strategizing a way to KILL me, because I walked to...
         ...10 Innisbrook, like, 2 days ago... my aunt Terri Cook’s old house.
Leavey : ...the dog lady...?
Me     : Yep. The dog lady.
Leavey : ...pretty sure that (your aunt/the dog lady), isn’t goin’ around havin’ people killed and shit...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

So, here’s the thing. Most people are morons. I’m not calling SHAEMUS LEAVEY a moron, either.
However, I am DEFINITELY calling MOST people in society, ESPECIALLY the ones that that IMMEDIATELY BALK or even 
SCOFF at some of my theories… morons. BALKING or SCOFFING means that they know I’m being serious, and they think
that I’m pathetic and that what I’m saying is nonsense. That’s an indication of someone that needs a REALITY CHECK.

Sometimes I AM just kidding around, and people will laugh and THAT IS INTENDED. 
However, sometimes I am actually being VERY FUCKING SERIOUS, so when they start LAUGHING, I can tell that they’re 
laughing AT ME and I say “Pull your head out of your ass, and shut the fuck up. I have more information than YOU DO.”

USUALLY that INFORMATION, is what the police are SUPPOSED to collect, whenever a CRIME IS REPORTED to them...
...and there is a KEY SPECIFIC TERM for this type of information, it’s called “EVIDENCE”.

EVIDENCE is what I OFFER TO SHARE WITH PEOPLE who ASSUME that it is nonsense, when it is CRITICAL.
However, morons will immediately ignore that it exists, and wave me away like I’m some fuckin’ clown boy... 
...for instance, my AUNT NANCY SMITH. 

That’s because she was BEING STUPID when I visited her in JULY 2022… and she was OPERATING ON HER ASSUMPTIONS. 
Normally, OPERATING ON YOUR ASSUMPTIONS is ok to do because you want to make FRIENDS with people, and that’s fine.

However, there’s a certain instance where there is a MORE RELIABLE WAY TO JUDGE PEOPLE... 
That process is called PRINCIPLE OVER PERSONALITY. 

By the way, she isn’t actually stupid… but, she was definitely being a bitch because someone fuckin’ told her a story.
She believed the story she was told, and that’s fuckin’ that man.
There’s NO WAY that ANYONE would EVER LIE to my AUNT NANCY SMITH… because of how fuckin’ important she is.
If I’m making her sound pretty ridiculous right now…? It’s fuckin’ warranted.

I discussed this concept in Chapter 2 – PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION, MOST PEOPLE IN SOCIETY judge other people by 
OPERATING ON THEIR ASSUMPTIONS… however, MORE INTELLIGENT PEOPLE operate on PRINCIPLE OVER PERSONALITY. Why…?
It is SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE, PEOPLE ARE UNRELIABLE AND THEY LIE A LOT. It’s just embedded into ALL human DNA.
Some people will say “I NEVER LIE”, bullshit. Yeah you do. Everyone lies, they just don’t realize how often they do.

That said, if you begin to DEVELOP SOME SUSPICION TOWARD SOMEONE IN PARTICULAR, you’ll want to CORROBORATE what you 
believe with EVIDENCE, or PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR, and this is the type of stuff that I am A LOT MORE TALENTED AT DOING,
than MOST PEOPLE IN SOCIETY. 

Typically, people in society don’t understand how these CLASSIFIED, TOP SECRET, SPY AGENCIES that happen to exist 
ALL AROUND THE WORLD... they will NEVER CONFIRM NOR DENY WHAT THEY KNOW. SO...

IF you happen to SUSPECT that SOMEBODY is a fucking FOREIGN SPY...?

Everyone will fucking lie to YOU and EVERYONE ELSE, too. And THAT MEANS, people will IMMEDIATELY ASSUME THAT THE 
SUSPICION IS DEFINITELY FALSE. That is why being a fuckin’ spy, is literally the EASIEST JOB IN THE WORLD.

I will state this openly and in the most serious tone I can, SOMETIMES I AM ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT ABOUT MY THEORIES.
However, SOMETIMES THEY ARE UNNERVINGLY CORRECT, and most people don’t make the effort to discern one from the other.

But, suppose I’m gonna be the type of idiot everyone else seems to be...
MAYBE what I COULD do, if I suspect that someone is fuckin working for MOTHER RUSSIA, or MOTHER ENGLAND...
...I could TOTALLY contact that organization, and ask them some fuckin tough ass questions...

Me     : *dials the phone number for the KGB* 
         *phone rings*
KGB    : *picks up the phone* Hey, thanks for calling the KGB, where our duty is to skullfuck everybody we can.
         How may I be of service, today...?
Me     : HEY, MY NAME IS MICHAEL COOK, I’M A GUY THAT LIVES IN THE UNITED STATES...
KGB    : HEY MICHAEL COOK, HOW THE HELL ARE YA...?
Me     : Good, good...
KGB    : What seems to be the reason for your call today, Mr. Cook...?
Me     : Well, I have a couple of TOUGH ASS QUESTIONS to ask you fucks today, regarding my suspicions...
KGB    : OooOOooOOooHHhhHh, TOUGH ASS QUESTIONS you say...?
Me     : Fuck yeah, dude.
         WICKED tough questions...
KGB    : I’m intrigued already, MICHAEL COOK...
         Well, don’t keep me waiting, what are those TOUGH ASS QUESTIONS you supposedly have...?
Me     : So, do you guys have a TERRI COOK that is currently deployed on a lifelong mission, in the UNITED STATES?
KGB    : I mean, I really doubt it, we have a lot of agents with names like NATASHA ROMANOV...
         ...or like NICKOLAI KRUPOVSKI...
         ...pretty sure this TERRI COOK is using an ALIAS...
         ...if you know her TRUE IDENTITY, I could totally help ya out...
Me     : Ah, nah.
         I was HOPING, that maybe YOU could help me figure that out...?
KGB    : Nah, standard policy is that we’re not supposed to CONFIRM or DENY an agent’s existence by their ALIAS.
Me     : Well, fuck. 
         This lady could’ve married my uncle, had something to do with the death of my FATHER, screwed my uncle 
         over financially for his entire life, did an outstanding job working with LAW FIRMS and made a LOT of
         friends here in the UNITED STATES JUSTICE SYSTEM, and she might not have been a real AMERICAN CITIZEN
         that ENTIRE TIME, huh...?
KGB    : That’s... what we do buddy.
         It’s why I said at the beginning, “Our duty is to skullfuck everybody we can.”
Me     : Well, holy fuck.
         What about the RUSSIAN DUDE that used to own the business on the FIFTH FLOOR of 46 STATE STREET, ALBANY NY?
KGB    : Buddy...?
         You obviously don’t know how ESPIONAGE AGENCIES actually work...
Me     : Nah, this is my first time contacting your organization, wasn’t sure what to expect...
KGB    : Well, we’re VERY SECRETIVE, VERY DECEPTIVE, and we will literally cause people to DOUBT THEMSELVES.
         In some cases, we actually kill some people because, hey... Mother Russia, buddy.
Me     : Wow, you guys kill a lot of people here in the UNITED STATES...?
KGB    : Well, I’m not supposed to tell you, but...
         Oh my fuckin’ god, you have no idea how easy it is for us to kill people in the UNITED STATES.
         EASIEST country in the ENTIRE WORLD, to kill people...
         ...because your society is full of MORONS.
Me     : I fuckin’ knew it, dude...
         I gotta respect the work you people are doing, cause...
         I agree, people here in the UNITED STATES are fucking morons.
KGB    : Hey, not everybody is a moron over there, so...
Me     : No, I understand that, but- my god, I am probably the SECOND person in my family to SUSPECT that a SPY,
         is in my family.
KGB    : Let me guess, people say you’re INSANE quite often, don’t they...?
Me     : Sometimes, when they feel like advertising that they’re a fuckin moron, yeah, people will ACCUSE me, of
         having DELUSIONS, or even flat out telling me that I have a fuckin track record, like my UNCLE RICK.
KGB    : Yeah, well... whaddya gonna do...? Ya know...?
Me     : Alright, well, what about my aunt JILL COOK...?
         I think she is the SECOND RUSSIAN SPY, to marry my uncle...
KGB    : Wow, holy shit... your uncle must not be very OBSERVANT...
Me     : Nah, him and my dad had a falling out a long time ago, and my uncle brought over an ENTERTAINMENT book
         back in 1994. My dad kept trying to tell my uncle, that SOMETHING FUCKING SHADY IS GOING ON, BRO.
         But, jeez, my uncle just thought my father was BIPOLAR SCHIZOPHRENIC, instead of admitting that my dad
         was just A LOT MORE INTELLIGENT and OBSERVANT...
KGB    : Heh, that’s just it man...
         JILL COOK sounds like an ALIAS, so, I really couldn’t tell ya based on THAT...
         But jeez, it really sounds like you’re onto something here, dude, cause...
         That’s like (3) or (4) fuckin people right there IN YOUR ACTUAL FAMILY, that MIGHT be foreign spies.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

The truth is, there’s no way that I could have put all of my suspicions into a few sentences that TROOPER LEAVEY
could’ve taken seriously and acted upon in all seriousness, because there were too many holes in my theories.

However, when I told him about the houses up the street that I believed may have been VICTIMIZED...?
He didn’t drive up that street at all when he drove away, and LEE DAVENPORT SR. was in a WHITE VAN following him
as he left. THAT in and of itself, DOES NOT NECESSARILY INDICATE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS, and I’m being very serious.

It could be the case that he thought I was being PARANOID, and that the video I showed him didn’t seem convincing
since I didn’t have any CONTEXT to provide him with, regarding the ATTACK, as well as my PRIVATE INVESTIGATION in
requesting RECORDS from SCSO. So what I’m suggesting is that, the HOLES would be FILLED IN LATER...
...but those hole would be filled in later after my device was REMOTELY DISABLED BY THE MANUFACTURER, because...

...of the USA-PATRIOT Act. Simply put, it allows FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS TO INVESTIGATE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED 
TERRORISTS TRAINED TO EVADE DETECTION, WITHOUT TIPPING THEM OFF AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE ACTIVELY BEING
INVESTIGATED.

In short, the DECLARATION that I am making, is that I have no real CLUE or EVIDENCE to DEFINITIVELY STATE that 
TERRI COOK is a Russian spy, nor that my aunt JILL COOK is a Russian spy, nor that the guy from the 5th floor of 
46 State Street was a Russian spy, nor that my uncle RICK SMITH is a Russian spy either... lots of spies bro.

The truth is, they are all SUSPICIONS. As in, I HAVE PASSED THE POINT WHERE THE THEORY THAT THEY ARE IS PLAUSIBLE.
PLAUSIBLE means that RICK SMITH will fuckin tell me I’m a fuckin loser scumbag that never succeeded at anything
in life, and that I’m just as much of a fuckin loser as my father always was...
...even though my father had HIGH GRADES in SCHOOL, COLLEGE PROGRAM, and his MILITARY ASVABS ENTRANCE EXAM.

So in totality, I’m fighting an UPHILL BATTLE, because there may be ULTERIOR MOTIVES for how people treat me.
Totally fucking serious about that, there may in fact be, ULTERIOR MOTIVES for the WAY that PEOPLE, TREAT ME.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Bigger Picture",@"
Situations where former senator Hillary Rodham ‘Who gives a shit...?’ Clinton managed to get herself arrested, 
and prosecuted and then imprisoned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, like she SHOULD’VE been back in 
July 2016... well, that didn’t happen at all. 
But- a REVERSAL OF LOGIC needs to happen a lot more often, so she wound up being in prison for...
    - criminal negligence in handling classified government documents

The reason why it DIDN’T happen, is because SOME PEOPLE ARE ABOVE THE LAW. 
Which means, SOME PEOPLE ARE TREATED EXACTLY LIKE ROYALTY, but there is no royalty in our government, is there?
Well, guess what. Now there is, because the USA-PATRIOT Act converted America into a pseudo communist state, 
(but it also goes by the name of Surveillance Capitalism) and it shoves a middle finger right in the 
Constitutions fuckin’ face. 

So, unless you’re a member of the hidden government’s ROYALTY, then nobody has rights more important than this 
thing. USA-PATRIOT Act – it’s ALOT more than what it looks like.

Cause from my angle, JULIEN ASSANGE doesn’t deserve to be in prison.
                     --------------
And, EDWARD SNOWDEN deserves a trial. Especially since he LEAKED people doing HIGHLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL SHIT.
     -------------------------------                                          ----------------------------
We are technically a democracy still, right...? 
Did you know that a democracy has this thing called “a fair trial”...?

The Department of Justice would be fucking amazed if they actually read the constitution sometime, and while
they’re at it...? Grab a dictionary too. Really, we should closely examine all of these fuckin’ bullshit laws 
that they’ve passed over the last 20 years since George W. Bush committed treason and then basically nobody
had the balls to do anything about it. I mean it, George W. Bush is a BIG PUSSY THAT KILLED A LOT OF HIS OWN 
PEOPLE AND NOT (1) PERSON HAS DONE ANYTHING TO PROVIDE JUSTICE FOR THAT EXCUSE OF A MAN.

If anything, I feel a need to smack some people across the face in our government, ya know...? 
Like, it’s not OK to spy on your own citizens FOR PROFIT → NOT PROTECTION, and then just be OK with violating
everyone’s constitutional rights and everything... I have a serious problem with some people of authority that
just so happen to make these consistently moronic decisions, day in, day out, they raise the bar on how far 
they will go, to call the monarchy that we live in, a DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. But that’s cause they’re morons.

They’re not all morons by the way, but... when I see this pattern where JULIEN ASSANGE pissed off some people
at the CIA and Exxon Mobil...? Oh boy, they’re more important than anybody in THIS country, holy fuck dude.
JULIEN ASSANGE is sitting in a prison because Mike Pompeo feels like he needs to be there. 

What if I had the same amount of money as Rupert Murdock, right...? And I could just throw it at people in the
Department of Justice...? Or like, this band of morons that have been in the CIA for X amount of time, when in 
(03/2017), WikiLeaks published a series of documents which detailed the CIA’s electronic surveillance and cyber 
warfare capabilities (VAULT 7), after which senior CIA officials discussed potentially kidnapping and 
assassinating Assange. 

The reason that they would actually sit around a table and discuss this shit, is because they can’t help how 
fuckin’ stupid they are. Really it’s the beginning and the end of the conversation, they wish they COULD...? 
But, they have this document that their main mission, is to [UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION]... which they don’t do.

So, when they’re busy shoving dildos up their asses and sentencing JULIEN ASSANGE to 175 years in prison...
...and HILLARY RODHAM “Who gives a shit...?” CLINTON can just do the same shit, over and over...
...no care or worry in the fuckin’ world... she’ll be golden. 

She can do the same thing JULIEN ASSANGE did, thousands of times, and never get in trouble for that at all. 

ALSO, George W. Bush can commit treason, and pass the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001 into law...? Hm.
I really hope I am causing people to question “Just what is your strategy here, with this rhetoric...?”

Well, to piss certain people off that think they’re hot shit.
I have to commit myself to understanding that these guys in the CIA, they’re morons. 

I know they’re not morons at all, otherwise they wouldn’t be employed there.
But, some of them ARE, regardless of how intelligent they may be... 
Not ALL of them, but the ones that are actually COOL with JULIEN ASSANGE getting 175 years in prison. 

For what...? It’s not like these people fuckin’ ever work that hard, as long as they’re COOL with ASSANGE being
in PRISON for 175 years, that means 100% of the people that have this mentality, are 1) morons, and 2) lazy. 
Literally ALL that means. Doesn’t mean anything else. 

General McKenzie ALONE has done a lot more work than anyone at that table, talking about KIDNAPPING A DUDE, 
because he was PUBLISHING DOCUMENTS that LEAKED INFORMATION about YOU PEOPLE DOING QUESTIONABLE SHIT. 
COOL STORY BRO.

George W. Bush is the biggest pussy that ever lived.
Why...? Because he allowed our country to become this MIRROR IMAGE of a communist country, and literally tried
to force everybody to call FRENCH FRIES → FREEDOM FRIES. YEAH.

Person shows up at fuckin’ McDonalds and then the person says “Would you like freedom fries with that...?”

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Person    : Uh, what the hell are FREEDOM FRIES, I just want FRENCH FRIES...
McDonalds : Well, legally we’re not allowed to say the word FRENCH before FRIES, anymore.
            Because of the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001, we just cannot LEGALLY say the word FRENCH, before FRIES.
            So...
Person    : I mean, are they still the same thing as FRENCH FRIES...?
McDonalds : I can neither CONFIRM, or DENY that they are the same thing as <unspecified> FRIES.
Person    : I don’t understand what you’re saying...
            ...are they still the same FRIES...?
McDonalds : Oh yes, they’re STILL the same FRIES, alright...
Person    : So, they’re still the same FRIES, just, with a fuckin’ stupid name now...?
McDonalds : Hey buddy, I don’t make up the rules...

And just like that...? Oh. Fuckin’ FREEDOM FRIES. Not FRENCH FRIES. 
I dunno if this dude ever realized that, or thinks about it when he looks at himself in the mirror and says...

GWB : Dude, why do you fuckin’ suck ass at writing and reading speeches in public...? 
      *shakes head* Shanksville was just not a good performance...

Anyway, for what it’s worth, George W. Bush isn’t quite the same level of queer that Andrew Cuomo has always 
been, but- I gotta say, I feel like George W. Bush pissed all over the American flag, AND the constitution, 
and did his country a disservice by being involved in the destruction of the World Trade Center. I’ll explain...

There are plenty of people that deserve to be in prison, but something weird happens where... 
...the laws of physics are (← reversed →), almost exactly like how our government does MATH. 
There APPEARS TO BE a lot of MORONS who can’t READ, that run the government.

You can tell em that Russia and Britain have people here stealing money from people, but they don’t care.

Nobody else is able to provide this STINGING CRITIQUE of a government that I can... 
I know damn well I’m pissing some people off... and they have no idea why or how they are DESERVING of this 
critique. They think they do an awesome job. They really are that brain dead to think that. 

Way back in 2019, we were in like `$23T of debt. Now, it’s 2022 and that number has exceeded `$30T. 
That’s `$7T of money that we spent...? In like, *checks watch* 3 years, dude. 

I’m actually highly impressed, because in that 3 years...? Afghanistan had about `$1T worth of equipment, 
bombs, weapons, tanks, vehicles, helicopters, bombs, missiles, ammunition, etc. FREELY HANDED TO THE TALIBAN.
COOL FUCKIN STORY, HUH...? SORTA MAKES YOU WONDER WHY THE FUCK YOU PAY YOUR TAXES OR YOUR BILLS...

And check this out... icing on the cake.
HILLARY CLINTON, is just doing amazingly well with herself, and showing up to Madeline Albright’s funeral...
...meanwhile JULIEN ASSANGE is in prison right now, for the next 175 years, for being a fucking JOURNALIST...
...from a TOTALLY DIFFERENT COUNTRY THAN THE UNITED STATES...
...and somehow... this dude is being EXTRADICTED TO THE UNITED STATES TO FACE ESPIONAGE CHARGES...
...for basically telling people to fuck off, because the material he was DISTRIBUTING...
...was WORTHY OF STARTING A FUCKING WAR. Amazing.

So, for like a bunch of dipshits at the CIA to sit around at a fucking TABLE, discussing how to KIDNAP and 
ASSASSINATE a fucking JOURNALIST... tells me that someone needs to be fucking shot to death. Or, allow me to
state it MUCH MORE SPECIFICALLY... someone needs to be executed by a US Military firing squad...
...with extreme prejudice. Ah. THAT should really hit the correct emotional note right there.

So, some people at the CIA having a good explanation for the WILD SPENDING that our country does... 
with nothing to really “show for it”.

But hey, BRUCE TANSKI, JOHN HOFFMAN, ERIC CATRICALA, they can fuckin commit fraud at KEY BANK, because why not?
They’re right to think that nobody is EVER gonna be able to catch them... 
They’re just a lot smarter than everybody.

You know...? BRUCE TANSKI...? Earned the right to commit fraud unimpeded at Key Bank, and NEVER get caught 
doing that. Wanna know why...? Because JULIEN ASSANGE can LITERALLY release damaging documents that outline...


...how many morons run the CIA. They’re not smart enough to catch guys like BRUCE TANSKI committing fraud. 
They’re not smart enough to be able to catch HILLARY CLINTON committing basically the same “crime”...

Nah. The reason why, isn’t because they’re morons. These people are not morons at all...
They just don’t actually give a shit. (← That’s the truth.)

That’s a pretty good indication that the government is incompetent, and doesn’t know what the fuck it’s doing.

"Walk softly, and carry a big stick." -Theodore Roosevelt. The remainder of that sentence goes:
"...cause you never know when you have to crack it over somebody’s head, for lying to your face."
That’s really the only reason anybody would wanna walk softly and carry a big stick.

$Book.AddSection(8,"New World Order",@"

In order to understand why the USA-PATRIOT Act even exists, it is necessary to discuss what MAJOR EVENT 
LED TO IT BEING PASSED INTO LAW. For over 20 years, treasonists continued to make these mistakes along the 
way that allowed me to "better connect the dots". 

George W. Bush is one of those treasonists, or he knows exactly who they are. 
It is probably TRUE that the (NSA/National Security Agency) had no idea about the attack on (09/11/2001).
I’d be willing to bet that even the (FBI/Federal Bureau of Investigation), or James fuckin’ Comey, had no idea.

However, it is very likely that some people at the (CIA/Central Intelligence Agency) DID, and had an OPEN FILE 
that was CLASSIFIED in reference to Osama Bin Laden (World Trade Center 7 had Exxon Mobil + CIA offices).

The reason why I SUSPECT this CLASSIFIED FILE EXISTED, is because...
...Osama Bin Laden ALREADY ATTACKED the World Trade Center in 1993. 
MAYBE... the Central Intelligence Agency, didn’t keep a SINGLE pair of eyes on him after that.
MAYBE... the CIA which skull fucks opponents left and right all around the world...
...they goofed up that (1) time. “Whoops, we fucked up alright...” -The CIA

Nah. Only a fucking moron would think that... 
I speculate that they had eyes on him for sure. To me, it seems more than just MOST LIKELY. 
These people aren’t stupid, they’re not gonna say "Whoops~! Forgot about that fuckin’ guy...~!"

But, hey. Maybe they did. If I’m having sex with some girl, and I accidentally bust a nut inside, maybe I won’t 
say anything. Oh well. Ya know? Then I could say “It’s not my fault that you had sex with me, and trusted me...” 
Maybe I could say something like “It’s YOUR fault, that I ejaculated in you... and got you pregnant... Not mine.”

I realize that sounds ridiculous, but that is how the government sounds when they try to play it off like: 
“ooOOOoOOoooooOOOhhhhhHHh bro, we didn’t know that towel-headed bastard was gonna fuckin’ do what he did...”
Oh. Nah...? Smartest people in the world are just gonna pretend like they slipped up...? Yeah. I don’t think so.

They weren’t caught off guard, therefore, nothing SUSPICIOUS stuck out. You’re an asshole to think otherwise...~!
If anything, a CITIZEN stating these things will get their attention, and then they will tell them over and over,
“LOOK BUDDY... 9/11 TRUTH, IT’S OUT THERE. IT’S CALLED THE NIST REPORT. READ IT SOMETIME.”

It IS out there. The NIST report I HAVE read. It’s almost like some girl was compelled to suck my dick for 12 
hours straight, and at no point at all, did she make me bust a nut. That’s what the NIST report is/does.

In other words, NOT ONLY IS IT A BORING READ, but it’s MISSING CRITICAL INFORMATION.
Ya know...? At least, if some girl sucks at giving head, and hasn’t made me bust a nut after, like...
*checks watch* like a half hour or an hour at MOST... I’m gonna tell her to turn around, and then do something
else that’s a lot more productive. Ya know...?

If you think that report sucks ass, and the 12-hour blowjob wasn’t “good enough for ya”, they’ll CENSOR the shit 
out of that person in every single possible way... This process is worse than being blacklisted.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Legislation",@"
Anyway, the TREASONISTS that WROTE the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001, there is no fucking way that they wrote that 
document AFTER 9/11. It was written BEFOREHAND. 
They are the people who conspired to destroy the World Trade Center on 9/11 through a process called: 
CONTROLLED DEMOLITION. 

That’s not unlike telling some girl to quit her yappin’, turn around, get up against the wall...
...and when she does...? Well, she’s gettin’ fucked. THAT sort of CONTROLLED DEMOLITION. 

Like, the Twin Towers... they were literally (2) Towers... which compare to a girl, literally havin’ (2) legs.
The dude banging the snot out of her from behind, is the equivalent to (2) 747’s flying into those buildings.
There’s no way that an aluminum plane is gonna cause a CONCRETE AND STEEL BUILDING TO COLLAPSE, unless you have
some EXTRA FIREPOWER SOMEHOW... 

In the same token, a penis is never going to cause a girl to suddenly collapse onto the floor either, because 
she has legs, she’s not gonna suddenly not use em to stand up... Not unless you’re packing some serious D... 
...and you do such a well-controlled demolition of her rear end...?

THEN, that would make total sense. Cause, when SHE orgasms...? 
It’s gonna PRACTICALLY cause a THIRD leg that she doesn’t even have, to ALSO collapse...
That’s right.

(2) planes hit (2) towers, but a THIRD just so happened to CONVENIENTLY also collapse, and nobody was like...

...that’s strange. I didn’t see a plane hit that one... I’m being facetious, many people did think/say that.

Yeah, well, the reason why a THIRD building that was about a quarter mile away, got demolished too...?
Is because there was some EVIDENCE, of an act of TREASON, in that fuckin’ building.

Wanna know what that building contained...? 
Not nearly enough diesel to cause that building to collapse, that’s for fuckin’ sure. 

Regardless, this is how strongly this girl is gonna wind up orgasming... 
It will be SOOOOO amazing, that she will think for a split second, she might have a third leg.
I’m absolutely serious.

Just like the twin towers had a 3rd tower, one that wasn’t hit by a plane at all...
(3) legs, and that leg ALSO just, couldn’t bear to keep her standing up... they all collapsed.
Cause there was some very high-quality, EXPLOSIVE action goin’ on behind the scenes, after all.

Look, even though that shit is impossible...? 

That is the equivalent story that the National Institute of Standards and Technology TOLD us, after 09/11/2001.
If she feels like yappin’ afterward...? Fine.

Calling these people morons is a pretty stupid thing to do... 
...no one ever said they weren’t smart, but even they still make mistakes.

The idiots that flew into the towers, aren’t the treasonists... 
...they didn’t know they were flying right into a trap.
trap (noun: a situation in which people lie in wait to make a surprise attack)

The IDIOTS that INSTALLED the THERMITE and the EXPLOSIVES that DESTROYED (WTC 1|2|7)...? 
They were AMERICANS, those treasonists conspired to piss off Osama Bin Laden (which they were doin’ for years), 
to blow up the (3) buildings, and THEN pass the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001 that converted America to a NEW THING 
called SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Iraq/Kuwait",@"
Now they can tell anybody they want, to “Suck a fuckin’ dick, bro”. Now, they’re gonna finish what they started 
in Desert Storm. They were able to invade Iraq (completing Desert Storm/Kuwait), THEN find Saddam Hussein in a 
spider hole, then Exxon Mobil took command of their oil fields where they generated TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 
Free money, basically. Like when I played Starcraft, I would attack the ENEMY, and then TAKE THEIR RESOURCES 
to BUILD MORE ARMY UNITS. SAME EXACT CONCEPT, but, in real life.
    
The Bushmeister didn’t really care about catching Osama Bin Laden... Neither did Dick-for-a-nose-Cheney.
That’s why they had a ceremony called "Mission Accomplished"... because, setting his sights on the mountainous 
region of Afghanistan, to get Osama Bin Laden...? Didn’t really matter as much as that oil. Osama was just 
a scapegoat. Osama ALREADY fell into the trap, leave the table scraps for the NEXT president. 

Osama Bin Laden was basically already fucked, and his face was plastered all over the world. 
So, everyone was ALREADY lookin’ for him, it’d only be a matter of time. So, he wasn’t a priority. 

Dick Cheney probably could’ve been less obvious about that whole ordeal, but he never gave a shit about 
manipulating Osama Bin Laden into staging that attack on 9/11/2001... cause they wanted the OIL.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Yeah. You’d have to be the dumbest son of a bitch that ever lived, to not understand that.
Especially considering that the PRESIDENT at the time, USED TO OWN MULTIPLE OIL COMPANIES... that went BANKRUPT.

Cause he was like, friends with the people at ENRON, like SKELLING (he did prison time). Enron was a company
that basically sold bullshit stocks and energy shares. They were basically a shell corporation, not really doing
anything except selling their name, that was it. They actually got too cocky with the control they had, and the
state of California experienced these things called “rolling blackouts”. That’s mainly because the entire purpose
of the company was to EXFILTRATE MONEY from innocent people, and ripping them off. Still plenty of that today...

Anyway, yeah. GWB took some lessons from Enron. Trillions of dollars’ worth of OIL, sounded like an awesome plan.
NOT because they really thought Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction... (They probably did think that) 

But Saddam never had the weapons Bush claimed he had. Nah. There were a few ANTHRAX scares which caused some 
people to freak the fuck out about chemical weapons... but, that seemed to be largely overblown.

Plenty of things happened in Afghanistan that I wasn’t there for, however, a lot of what happened there is seen

starring Claire Danes... probably not EXACT or PRECISELY ACCURATE DEPICTIONS, but I gotta say based on what I’ve
seen in the news and translated from the movies/shows, they seem fairly accurate.

95% of the world’s opium came from Afghanistan at one point. Perhaps as high as 98% actually. 
They tried to grow it in many other places, but it sucks ass in every other climate... 
Afghanistan is like the best place it can be grown. 

Guys like Richard Sackler are the reason why some of the farmers in Afghanistan actually started doing really
well for themselves and they were making a lot of money, supporting their own local economies and everything.

The problem IS, if people tried to grow the stuff on their own...? They would get their entire farm seized, and
even confiscated.

That’s when Purdue Pharma finally got it’s shit together, and then the news had reports of things SLOWLY 
UNFOLDING in Afghanistan. The truth is, chronologically speaking, we invaded Afghanistan right after the Twin 
Towers were attacked. But- I believe that the attack was a PRETEXT to invade Iraq/Kuwait... which, is what we
wound up doing. General McKenzie was deployed in Afghanistan...

I’m not going to suggest that it was ONLY for poppies, but it was pretty apparent that they’d really rather be
over in Iraq, so... Sackler had to convince Bush that there were some resources in Afghanistan that we could
benefit from, such as RAW OPIUM POPPY PRODUCTION.

Once they took out an area, they sent a shitload of the raw opium plants back to the United States for 
processing, just like on the show “The Punisher” on Netflix. They may actually have processed everything 
into heroin or some other precursor before shipping it back.

Saddam Hussein was a scapegoat. Was he any worse than the leader in North Korea... or wherever else? 
Saddam WAS bad, but the episode in Cambodia was pretty bad too... However, it didn’t have oil fields. 
Iraq/Kuwait sure as hell did...~! I won’t jump into NOAM CHOMSKY’s territory, but he has discovered a lot
of what I write about, and this dude is arguably the most important intellectual of our time.

Anyway, I know so many of my fellow American citizens will feel as bad as the Russians do right now,
that their leader sent so many of them to die, and they all died believing this dude was telling the truth.

But, that is the sick fucking game that these people play. 
Noble soldiers that served in the war- they’ll read all of this, and some of them will get so fucking upset 
with me for making these ‘baseless’ accusations in their eyes, right...? 

But then they should watch "Collateral Murder", and then consider that they may have thousands more of these
classified files that they never knew existed.

In other words, these people have been working INCREDIBLY FUCKING HARD, to silence me.

That should be the FIRST fuckin’ clue right there. Ya know, I didn’t tell any of the guys that went over 
there, (for instance this dude Zach Gallup never once told him that he was a bad dude) that they’re a real 
scumbag for putting their lives at risk and almost getting blown up. 

Not one time did I ever shake my finger in any of their faces and say “OoOOoOOoOhhhHHH you shouldn’t kill 
people bro~!” Nah. They did the country a service and I salute them for it. 
I’m not trying to piss all over the flag.

BUT- I guess saying some of this shit, is LITERALLY about the same thing in their eyes. 
Can’t imagine that any of them think they were lied to like Putin lied to HIS soldiers. 
Maybe not, though.

Many American soldiers were blown up and eviscerated fighting a war for a cause they believed was noble... 
and never once realized they were all lied to. Not once. There’s really something bad about blind loyalty 
like that. 

I never said “Oh, Saddam didn’t deserve that shit”, cause he did. 
I never said “Osama Bin Laden must be a cool dude to hang out with.”, cause I never thought that either. 

I was a proponent of people getting a FAIR TRIAL. 
As bad as the situation was with Osama Bin Laden, even he deserves a chance to speak for himself. 
Why...? 

Because then someone can be blamed for something they didn’t fuckin’ do at all, and NOBODY questions it. 
Now I’m exaggerating slightly, because I’m sure many people fuckin’ questioned it alright... 

Did Osama do that shit...? 
MAYBE HE DID. That’s not the point, because the point is...
THIS IS AMERICA, and the THING THAT MAKES THIS COUNTRY SO GREAT... is FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.

Some douchebag doin’ somethin’ mad shady that you don’t like...?
Let everybody know, cause that guy can go suck a fuckin’ dick, bro.
Some people might even agree, “Yeah, that dude is fuckin’ shady as fuck, bro...” (← Freedom of Expression/Press)

What I’d really like to know, is if there were many classified files where our country was MANIPULATING this dude, 
to keep this mentality on the back of his mind, where America is gonna keep taking shit from the middle east, and 
Osama Bin Laden actually thought that America would never actually respond to the twin towers being attacked. 

People don’t consider that there’s plenty of blame to go around, and I can’t expect that America is going to say 
“You know what... we did actually manipulate this cocksucker.”

Cause if our country is going to drown people out and sentence them to 175 years in prison like Julien 
Assange, then this country is a contradiction, not a FREE country at all.

Suffice to say, people have a right to SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES, taking that away from them makes us NO different
than Hitler, or Stalin. Yeah. We’re VERY different from those fucks, right...? But at the same time, not
giving Osama Bin Laden the same type of trial that Saddam Hussein at least got BEFORE he was killed...
...it says a lot about how America doesn’t actually uphold that principle anymore.

So then it doesn’t matter if some innocent person is accused of something they didn’t do, and then gets 
thrown in prison or executed... Nah. Because that’s fuckin’ annoying, right...?

Well, think again. It definitely fuckin’ DOES matter, because ANYBODY can then be ACCUSED of ANYTHING...
...regardless of whether or not they’re guilty. Even if there’s proof or evidence that CONTRADICTS the
nature of the accusation...? 

Oh well, dude. 
That’s what America is now. So, if you don’t like it...?
Thats just too fuckin’ bad, dude... “nobody” gives a shit anymore, that’s what my doctor even told me.

Not unless you have MONEY, cause then that’s when the magic happens, and then SUDDENLY... people give a shit. 
There’s a huge problem with that.

it (2) thoughts back on October 26th, 2001. Here’s what makes them treasonists...
The charge that I am making, is that George W. Bush should be held accountable for: the deaths of (2,996 people)

The reason WHY, is because the buildings did NOT collapse for any reason other than:

Those ALUMINUM AIRPLANES could have NO FUCKING POSSIBLE WAY in TIME or SPACE, to have caused the collapse 
of those (2) buildings, in the exact fashion that they collapsed. But, even if they did...? Please continue.

Most of those (2,996 deaths) could have been prevented. 
The reason that they WEREN’T prevented, is because it was a CRITICAL PART of the PLAN. 
Had they been destroyed (1) HOUR EARLIER, then maybe approximately 300 people...
...more or less, would’ve died (that’s like 2700 FEWER people~!) 

The TIMING and the NUMBER OF CASUALTIES needed to look PLAUSIBLE.

After the first plane struck the tower, the (police/firefighters) headed to the WTC. 
When they got there, they began to look for survivors... 
That is when a man with a remote control sitting in the Exxon Mobil office in (WTC 7) saw them go in, and THEN,  
initiated the COMMAND that caused the FIRST TOWER to begin SETTING OFF THE EXPLOSIVE PACKAGES AND CHARGES
(not unlike how Hans Grueber detonated charges in "Die Hard III: With a Vengeance"). 

Many people heard these explosions for several minutes, they’re even featured in the movie with Nicholas Cage. 

The first tower collapsed nearly IMMEDIATELY after the police showed up. 
Then, George W. Bush said in his head: 
GWB: Thank you for your service, you were an outstanding citizen, your death will not be in vain...

Explosions are what happens when Bob Lutz (former director of General Motors) shits his pants, 
but those aren’t fatal... The ones that ARE fatal, would be more efficient than a jackhammer, at exposing 
the steel columns in the WTC. Which you would need, to expose the steel underneath the concrete... and
that steel was actually the highest grade structural steel that existed in the late 60’s early 70’s.
That steel requires about 2500°F-2800°F to melt.

If someone were to ask an ACTUAL engineer that actually BUILT and DEMOLISHED buildings...?
Robert Korol is a guy everyone should talk to BEFORE the National Institute of Standards and Technology. 
...or even other engineers/scientists that studied the collapse like Leeroy Hulsey, Xili Quan, or Feng Xaio...
...they’re gonna tell ya in a real nice way that Shayam Sundar...
...and anyone who contributed to the NIST 9/11 report...
...they either NEVER FUCKIN’ STUDIED ENGINEERING...
...or they just SUCK ASS AT IT.
All these guys I just listed, they ALL have more experience than anybody at NIST, and they ALL conclude that 
those buildings were subjected to CONTROLLED DEMOLITION.

Someone issued a "command" for the buildings to be destroyed, and that is the act of treason I am charging 
former president George W. Bush with provisioning. The Secret Service is protecting a treasonist.

If it wasn’t HIM that gave that order -> then the ROYALTY/MONARCHY that did, needs to be specified.
Otherwise, why have a constitution at all...? 

Why not just take a fuckin’ lighter out, and burn it? 
Why not just have a brand new document that says “Fuck you all, this is what I say.”
Don’t be a whiny little bitch that has to quietly be a big pussy... just do away with our entire democracy.

...they’ll all say “What the hell were our rights again...?”

They haven’t had rights for a long time, mainly cause if I see some hot girl from a distance, and I start
lookin’ at her, I’m gonna be intrigued. But the very moment that some fuckin’ douchebag has to stand in the way, 
or starts talkin’ to her...? I’m gonna have NO FUCKIN SHOT now, cause that motherfucker is a lot closer to her.

Nah, she doesn’t care about the Constitution that was written like back in 1787... Nah.
She wants somethin’ that’s WAY new and more cool...
...so the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001 is basically the young Italian stallion. 

That doesn’t mean that the Constitution isn’t able to be ENFORCED, it just means that you have to tell a lot 
of lazy dicked douchebags that you’ve decided to FORM A MILITIA so that actual professionals can enforce 
the constitution, and then aim rifles at people that pretend it doesn’t exist.

When that happens, what can they do...? 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Them    : OooOoOhohHHh that’s illegal.
Militia : Uh, so is censorship, bud.
Them    : Nobody’s doing any censorship at all...
Militia : Nah, yeah people are definitely doin’ that, like Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook.
          Notorious for censoring people, and they need to be arrested for it.
Them    : He’s got billions of dollars.
Militia : Yeah, well, he won’t if he keeps pressing his fuckin’ luck.
          Can’t expect people in Congress to be ALERT and AWARE of how bad the problem is.
Them    : Whatever bro. 
          Federal investigators can follow highly sophisticated terrorists trained to evade detection.
Militia : Yeah, well... that means they can pretend as if they’re royalty...
          But we don’t have royalty, it’s in the constitution.

 Look, the statutes are all right there, I’ve compacted them and arranged them to be a lot more clear-cut, and 
 understandable. That process isn’t exactly an easy thing to do, to take a COMPLICATED DOCUMENT, and compact it 
 down to the point where it’s COOL LOOKING, and EASY FOR ANY LAWMAN TO READ, and UNDERSTAND: 
 “Oh, ok, cybercrime somehow fits in this place, SOMEWHERE... right?”
 Ya know, the part where it says:

 WELL, I’m gonna get some HEMS and HAWS, because none of the LOCAL COPS seem to know what this fuckin’ document 
 says. In fact, I’d go so far as to say, that each time I talk about it with people...? They must think I’m some 
 asshole that only cares about an annoying document that they’ve never read, and won’t care to read it...

 So, I’m the asshole here. Cause. Nobody cares if there’s a TEAM OF POLICE OFFICERS that are ABUSING TECHNOLOGY

 SCSO   : Dude, everybody’s in a RACKETEER INFLUENCED CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION.
          Get over yourself already...
 Me     : That’s illegal though.
 SCSO   : Oh well, dude.
          How many times have we heard you making these complaints...?
          Hm...?
 Me     : A lot.
 SCSO   : Look, there’s nothing we can do about all that.
          You just... gotta suck it up, dude.
          *shakes head* Move on with your life already, man...
 Me     : Do you even know what the term RACKETEERING is...?
 SCSO   : Nah man, that sounds like a totally made up term.
          You’re bullshittin’ me...
 Me     : Nah, it’s a real crime that the guy who runs SCSO, does.
 SCSO   : I mean, there’s really nothing I can do, bub.
 Me     : You could take my statement... ya know...?
 SCSO   : Look pal...
          *points* You see that guy over there...?
 Me     : Which one...?
 SCSO   : The one walkin’ his dog.
 Me     : Yeah, I see him.
 SCSO   : Buddy, HE’S probably in a RACKETEER INFLUENCED CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION, too. 
          Everybody is...
 Me     : You have no fucking idea what that is, do you...?
 SCSO   : Listen buddy...
          Nah.
          I- I don’t actually know what that is...
 Me     : Alright, well at least you’re being honest with me.
          Your supervisor, his name is MICHAEL ZURLO...
          He’s supposed to make damn certain that you know what CRIMES are.
          Otherwise, having you on the police force is against the law.

 SCSO   : Wow, I have heard of those guys.
 Me     : Yeah, they’re also guilty of committing BANK FRAUD at KEY BANK.
          Do you know how to arrest someone for something like that...?
 SCSO   : Look man, *chuckles* heh. 
          I’m just a guy. 
          I wouldn’t even know the first thing about catching someone committing RACKETEERING, or FRAUD.
 Me     : No, I totally understand that, that’s why you SHOULD NOT BE A FUCKING POLICE OFFICER.
 SCSO   : Listen buddy, I’ve been a police officer at SCSO for many years.
 Me     : Yeah, well... you should consider making the time driving around with a STATE TROOPER, if you want to
          have a MUCH BETTER IDEA on how to be a policeman. 
          They’re not perfect EITHER... 
          But, they are typically pretty fuckin’ informed about stuff like RACKETEERING, or even EXTORTION.
 SCSO   : What’s EXTORTION...?
 Me     : Well, I’m glad that you asked me that question, because I have a feeling that MICHAEL ZURLO isn’t doing

          | EXTORTION is the PRACTICE of OBTAINING BENEFIT through COERCION. In most JURISDICTIONS, its likely |

          | making UNFOUNDED THREATS to OBTAIN an UNFAIR BUSINESS ADVANTAGE is ALSO a form of EXTORTION.       |

          You don’t even have any PROOF of such a thing.
 Me     : Nah, I totally do, I have pictures of these assholes and I also had a video that I showed to a TROOPER.
          THEN after I showed the video to him...?
          Well, somebody remotely disabled my device and eliminated the evidence I had on my device.
 SCSO   : Yeah, well... take it up with them.
 Me     : What I’m tryin’ to tell ya, is that you have some police officers that are committing CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES.
          For instance, SOMEONE THAT YOU WORK WITH...
          Like, JAMES LEONARD.
          COMMITTED A SERIOUS CRIME CALLED OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, DESTROYING EVIDENCE, and...
          ...TELEPHONY DENIAL OF SERVICE
          OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE at CENTER FOR SECURITY, and REMOTELY FROM MY DEVICE.
          THEN this cocksucker actually wrote (2) reports where I somehow got in trouble after I dialed 911 twice.
          That’s actually a CAPITAL CRIME BRO.
 SCSO   : He’s a good dude though, man, I really doubt that he’d do somethin’ illegal to ya...
 Me     : Nah, I think you people all need to be reevaluated by an actual LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONAL.

          That event happened SO LONG AGO...

 SOME OF THESE STATUTES ARE BEING MISUSED.  
 Perhaps the reason that they haven’t openly stated that the Constitution is basically dead, is because 
 they’re trying to avoid a civil war. I think the real reason is because people in the military, if they 
 found out that I was 100% correct, they’re not gonna waste any time holding people accountable.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Examination (2)",@"
The same "command" was issued to the second building, eliminating nearly 3000 people that day…
…it is likely that at least 2000 of those people could have survived, at a bare minimum.

The REASON those buildings were subjected to controlled demolition, is because Larry Silverstein had just 
changed the insurance on the building... to cover terrorist attacks - (2) weeks prior to the attack.
    
And that is why I am charging that George W. Bush should be held accountable, and so should Exxon Mobil, and 
people in the CIA that knew those planes were inbound. Also, there’s a possibility that the planes that struck
the towers were NOT the same planes that took off from Boston, meaning (4) total planes were involved with the 
story about the towers. (See → Rebekah Roth)

George W. Bush provisioned another COMMAND to the (NIST/National Institute of Standards and Technology, to 
heavily redact the report, and withheld the TYPE of structural steel that was used to fabricate the building.
The grade of the structural steel was the highest tensile strength available in the late 60’s/early 70’s, and 
they were wrapped with the hardest concrete possible, allowing the buildings to be approximately 110 stories high.
    
(Shayam Sunder/NIST) suggested that the collapse of the buildings was because of the 2800°F of HEAT that
somehow traveled DOWNWARD, whereby SUFFICIENTLY WEAKENING THE STRUCTURAL BEAMS, whereby causing the collapse.   
However, I don’t think this guy realizes how stupid he sounds in this report. 

Without something such as 1) thermite AND 2) explosives...? 
Then an AIRPLANE made of ALUMINUM (which is a REALLY LIGHT METAL, not dense at all), with the hottest flammable 
thing on that plane being the JET FUEL that burns at a MAXIMUM of 1800°F, would NEVER outright destroy a bunch 
of CONCRETE, THEN sufficiently weaken the STEEL BEAMS inside that CONCRETE... and then get SO fuckin’ hot... 

...that the heat MELTED SOMETHING WITH A MELTING POINT OF 2800°F.
Suppose that this was the best jet fuel in the world and it somehow had a max burning temperature of 2800°F... 
...even IF all of that shit happened...?

Somehow the building never FELL AT AN ANGLE, like a tree would, after striking it with an axe...
That’s how fuckin’ stupid these people are.
In other words, the NIST report is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FACTORS.

The whole report, I’ve read a fair amount of it, it’s not bullshit within it, but the fact that it even exists 
is bullshit, because critical factors that actual engineers and scientists would want to see, they’re not 
specified. Sorta like drowning you with TUCKER CARLSON’s boring one-sided rhetoric.

The whole damn thing is just dancing around a very obvious series of points that are never made at all, just 
like how TUCKER CARLSON will talk shit about Bob Lutz’ golf game, and then have his buddy play that game instead.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Analogy [~] The Gay Kid",@"
The NIST report, is basically like when a gay kid hangs out with a girl all the time... 
Gay kid knows he’s never gonna have sex with that girl, because he likes penis in his (mouth/ass).
But, she has a vagina, which is sorta meant for penis.

He knows it, she knows it... he may have a penis...? 
But, it’s never gettin’ in that girls’ vagina. 
Also, they’ll never SHARE a penis, will they...? Nah. 
What penis is gonna enjoy being SHARED, by a hot girl, and some scruffy lookin’ dude...?

NOBODY’s penis will enjoy that. 
Not even Sean Hannity’s... not unless somebody swings both ways, but even then, it seems quite cringe worthy.
        
Anyway, the gay kid, he’s not looking to have sex with this girl, for obvious reasons. 
All he wants to do, is just... hang out. 
Since that’s all he wants to do...? 
He’s gonna be like an overprotective parent... on the lookout for any dude that this girl appears to be quite
attractive to, guarding her. It’s only inevitable, some dude will see HER, and then approach the both of them. 

That’s when this gay kid decides to initiate the "fuck off phenomenon". 
This kid, being as gay as he is, he’s going to interrupt any conversation she TRIES to have with a dude that 
wants to fuck her. And, it’ll work for a while, but not forever.

The first dude will come up... and try to talk to her or flirt with her. 
She, wants to fuck that dude, one that is obviously trying to get in her pants... but- uh-oh. 
Gay kid swoops in and says:

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Guy     : Hey, what’s going on? 
Girl    : *twirling her hair* Hi~!
Gay kid : Hey, buddy... 
          *gets in between the both of em, arms outstretched* I don’t fuckin’ think so, pal~!
          We’re goin’ shoppin’~!
          So, fuck off, chum.
Guy     : *hands up* Whoa, buddy... alright.
Girl    : He’s just saying hello, dude.
Gay kid : Yeah, but I thought you wanted some sick shoes...?
Girl    : Yeah, sick shoes... *sigh* 
          Well, it was nice meeting you~! 
          *...cause girls love shoes*
Girl    : You know, I thought that dude was cute. 
          Why do you do this shit?
Gay kid : Do what...?
Girl    : You know what. 
          What if I...
Gay kid : Don’t be ridiculous. 
          You’re gonna just try and have sex with the first dude you see...?
Girl    : ...what was wrong with that dude?
Gay kid : Well, I didn’t think he was all that good looking.
Girl    : Dude, you don’t know what I like.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

The gay kid doesn’t know what she likes. 
He’s just her good friend, is gay, and he’d prefer to be a roadblock and stand in the way...
...than to go home, hang out by himself, masturbate and cry... while she fucks that dude.    (← Can’t blame the girl)
He doesn’t get it that if some dude tries to flirt with HIM...? 
She’s gonna say "Alright, see ya later buddy~!" and then leave.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Examination (3)",@"
Same concept applies to the NIST 9/11 report, they’re gonna do what Shayam Sundar and George W. Bush did. 
Rather than for George W. Bush to award Robert Korol with a Nobel Peace Prize, George W. Bush thought it’d
be cool to censor the dog shit out of Robert Korol. Cool, huh?

I gotta say, outperforming an entire organization of "engineers" by himself...? 
Well, George W. Bush wasn’t OK with that, for a rather nefarious reason.

That report states some things that are a direct violation of the laws of physics, believe it or not. 
Which means that engineers may have been "consulted" with, to write the report, and then Shayam Sundar took 
a piss all over those pages that George W. Bush asked him to piss on. Just so we’re clear, I never studied 
structural engineering...? But, heat doesn’t travel downward unless you’re talking about conduction. 

You would need something that’s probably 3500°F or more, to get THAT MUCH conduction.
Nah. Heat travels UPWARD when it’s CONVECTION, which is pretty difficult to get to about 2800°F anyway. 
So, IF the heat WAS the cause for the steel beams to sufficiently weaken... then, that heat was caused by the 
other factors that go by the terms 1) thermite, and 2) explosives. 

Conveniently, there’s a real cool coincidence where people ACTUALLY HEARD those explosives...~!
THAT’S what caused the steel beams to sufficiently weaken, causing a collapse, for each respective building.

Using engineering to identify treasonists in the United States of America, is pretty cool when you’re not a
fuckin’ dumbass, isn’t it? The thing is, comparing so many different people’s reports and coverage allowed me...
to slap all of this together. The grade of the structural steel in that building, required at a bare minimum, 
2500°F - 2800°F to sufficiently weaken to the point where it could cause a structural collapse. 
Even then, the exterior of the building was also built to support a large portion of the weight of the building.

VERY IMPORTANT FACTORS ALSO WITHHELD:
- Jet planes are made with aluminum, WTC made with 
                   ___________________________________________________________________________
                   | steel | concrete | NIST 9/11 Report is PROPAGANDA made w/ Shayam Sundar |
                   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- Jet fuel burns at a maximum of 1800°F, which means an ADDITIONAL 700°F-1000°F would have been REQUIRED...
  ...to cause structural collapse of the building
- Additionally, the building would have collapsed AT AN ANGLE... even if that were the case.
- WTC 1 AND WTC 2 fell at a perfect 90° angle, in less than 20 seconds I believe...
  ...almost as if it was prepared for a CONTROLLED DEMOLITION AHEAD OF TIME...
- Many explosions were heard by witnesses, which MAY be attributable to: 
  ...the cracking of the concrete columns...
  ...but that’s not what those explosions were.
- Given the missing factors, those were EXPLOSIVES that the (military/CIA/Exxon Mobil) installed in: 
          _____________________________________________________________________________________________
          | World Trade Center 1 | World Trade Center 2 | World Trade Center 7 (later that afternoon) |
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- Diesel fires were attributed to the cause of WTC 7 collapse in the NIST 9/11 report, (← BULLSHIT)
- Central Intelligence Agency/Secret Service/Exxon Mobil → ALL had offices in WTC 7    (← CORRECT)
- ALL video footage of these buildings collapsing follow an INDISPUTABLE DYNAMIC called CONTROLLED DEMOLITION
- CONTROLLED DEMOLITION is something that requires a LOT of PREPARATION, to PULL OFF.
        
Which means the final verdict is as such...

I have to explain to people, that I EXPECT people won’t be able to read this document because, they’ll 
think it sounds nuts. But if something just SOUNDS crazy, yet happens to be ACCURATE, then it isn’t nuts 
or crazy at all. 

They should consider how President Putin has sent so many of his own countrymen, to die in Ukraine.

Russia’s countrymen, being lied to... 
    The countrymen that believe Putin, they’re morons. 
    The countrymen that DON’T believe Putin, they’re not morons at all, they know what he was doing... 
    ...but they can’t SAY that.

Just like the Americans that BELIEVE BUSH, they’re morons too.
The Americans that DON’T BELIEVE BUSH get:

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

MAYBE All of that stuff is in my head, ya know...? Maybe, I put all this time and effort into something
that will just get me thrown in jail, since I live in a “free” country where you can’t attack GWB, you also
can’t insult GWB, cause you’ll get censored. The truth is, I’m certain he’ll tell EVERYBODY AND THEIR MOTHER...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

GWB : It’s all just one big misunderstanding.
Me  : Pretty sure nobody’s misunderstanding anything dude.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Pretty sure that GWB has had a LOT of people censored, labeled delusional, jailed, killed, or attacked.

The problem is, if he does that too many times, his own countrymen will find out, and then the secret service 
won’t be able to protect his ass at all. They may hold in there for a while, but… I would wager that the military 
has probably mulled over this decision for a long time... 

So, if I go around telling people "I’m being censored", it’s because I know something that most people don’t.
They want me to shut the fuck up, so that everybody continues to do whatever the fuck they’re told, and that 
means they don’t give a flying fuck if the human race causes an extinction level event, nor do they give a 
shit about global warming.

They, love the idea that everyone on the planet, except them... will die at some point. It seems that way.
I might be making a dramatic point right now, maybe all of this shit doesn’t happen at all...
...and it’s just one long continuous fairy tale or dream.                                                  (← DENIAL)

The fact of the matter is that the government issued many statements and actions which only make the 
NIST 9/11 report look very suspicious, and the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001 was the primary reason for 
committing this act of sabotage against his own country.

The money earned by drilling oil fields over in Iraq, only served to delay the inevitable over the last 
20 years. The people in charge of these operations may be rich bastards now, but once all of that oil is 
gone...? They’re gonna go bankrupt pretty quickly, because they have no plan for when that happens.

It’ll be the most embarrassing thing ever in the history of mankind, that the people who backstabbed their own
brothers and sisters...? They didn’t fuckin’ have a game plan at all. I have to consider that these people who 
are actually smart, that they can’t help the fact that they will likely be executed by a Constitutional Militia 
if these details become too clear for others.

It stands to reason, that if George W. Bush is tried for treason and is found guilty, then the USA-PATRIOT Act 
may be relinquished. Because it is being abused. One way I can translate how it’s being abused, is that the FBI 
had to investigate someone in the town of Clifton Park/Halfmoon, for like well over a year... right...?

Apparently, once you have enough money, you can break whatever laws you feel like, and then the USA-PATRIOT Act 
can then be MISUSED. Ask Bruce Tanski how he does it.
        
The USA-PATRIOT Act converted America into a (pseudocommunist state/monarchy/Surveillance Capitalism)...

...perhaps immediately after the passing of the bill, it could be construed as if it was worded and dedicated 
toward the investigation of terrorists. 

However, there are some serious problems with the WORDING of this bill, AND, it appears to be the case, that 
it has enabled the federal government to commit treason against its own citizens. It is the reason why each 
citizens’ constitutional liberties/freedoms are being overridden, and Teddy Roosevelt is rolling in his grave.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Compare/Contrast",@"
There’s a serious problem with this country, when HILLARY CLINTON isn’t in prison, but- JULIEN ASSANGE IS.
...and Ed Snowden is over in Russia, still hasn’t sold out his country. 

I realize somebody might say he ALREADY did that, but, he didn’t leak EVERYTHING. 
He leaked CRITICAL things like UNCONSTITUTIONAL SHIT that we should take a lot of offense to as citizens. 

Like imagine if BARACK OBAMA realized he was arresting BENJAMIN FRANKLIN...                (← It’s a perfect analogy)
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN: It is the RESPONSIBILITY of EVERY citizen, to QUESTION AUTHORITY.

Imagine if BARACK OBAMA realized that he called BENJAMIN FRANKLIN a traitor to the United States.
It’s probably hard for people to see it that way, but that is literally the perfect metaphor.

If the Snowden leak exposed multiple people doing some unconstitutional shit... then maybe everyone should be
arrested for questioning authority. Ya know...? If Andrew Cuomo wants every guy in the state to suck his dick?
Then anyone that says “Nah, I’m all set.”, goes to prison. 175 years. 

I see a much BIGGER problem, than what he leaked, and JULIEN ASSANGE was already working to expose these things, 
with his work at WikiLeaks.

The USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001, needs some serious reform OR, to be outright relinquished, or replaced.
The biggest problem with it, is that if FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR #1 uses it to INVESTIGATE somebody for a LEGAL
reason, and then FEDERAL INVESTIGATOR #2 uses it to INVESTIGATE somebody for an ILLEGAL reason, NEITHER ONE 
OF THOSE INVESTIGATORS KNOW THEY’RE INVESTIGATING THE SAME PERSON. SO WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING, is that 
FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS INVESTIGATE EACH OTHER, and then sometimes, they’re serial killers like my cousin Ryan.

The USA-PATRIOT Act should’ve been replaced already by: (FIPS/Federal Internet Privacy Statutes).

I believe that it was passed into law by a series of TREASONISTS AKA The NEW WORLD ORDER...
...on the predication that it would be used SPECIFICALLY to combat TERRORISM. 
It wasn’t meant to be subvert our country into a PSEUDOCOMMUNIST STATE, AKA “Surveillance Capitalism”.

Perhaps what I’m about to say is rather EXTREME...
But perhaps, it is the reason why someone like HILLARY CLINTON could very well whip out a pistol...
...shoot someone in the head in public...
...and she will not get in trouble for that at all. (← This may be quite an exaggeration)

The Secret Service would even protect her from anyone who wants to put cuffs around her wrists for doing that. 
The reason she WON’T do it, is because a lot of people will realize how ALARMING that is...
...she just shot somebody and wasn’t arrested because the cops never put cuffs around her wrists...
...but even if they did, they would have her court appearance STAGED...
...and then give her a very different punishment like an ANKLE BRACELET...
...then people would catch onto that and think WOW THATS FUCKED...
...and then they will tell the military, OR, form a militia and make a fuckin’ stink...
...not all too different from what happened on January 6th, 2021 – although, it’d probably be a lot worse.

Anyway, suppose she did. The Secret Service would even tell Christopher Wray or James Comey that if they even 
THINK about arresting her, then they’re in BIG fuckin’ trouble, pal. So that is why they don’t do that... and 
then look the other way. 

Whereas, JULIEN ASSANGE, constantly pissing people off at the Central Intelligence Agency, Ms. Clinton, 
or big oil conglomerates that have caused IRREVERISBLE DAMAGE to the entire planet...

$Book.AddSection(8,"Excerpt [+] Julien P. Assange",@"
JULIEN ASSANGE was born Julien Paul Hawkins, his mom and dad were together briefly but split up before he was 
born. Some people may say “This dude came into the world with a friggen shovel in his hands”, as a metaphor.
But, this dude apparently came into the world with a LOT more intensity than that... 

So, it’d be more accurate to say, this dude...? *scoffs* This dude right here came into the world, like tractor 
trailer FULL of back-hoe. NOW, people have something they can VISUALIZE, that bears some equivalency. 

Though I’m sure that sounds dangerous, because no woman in history has ever survived giving birth to a 
tractor trailer full of backhoe... 
...well, that used to be the case up until JULIEN ASSANGE came into the world back on July 3rd 1971. 
This dude’s mom survived such a harrowing ordeal... had to have been traumatic for her.

Cause, *points* this dude was born to tell people, that he’s not the type of dude who plays games when it 
comes to the truth. *shakes head* Hell no, bub. Not THIS guy. There’s a world full of people who constantly 
do that... But, the truth is sacred to guys like him, and me. 
So... if he’s gonna be left with a long list of bad guys that keep comin’ at him...? 
Tryin’ to throw him off balance...? 
What do you think he’s gonna say...?
Well, I’ll tell you. He’s gonna come right out and say it: “Looks like it’s time for somebody to fuck off, bub...”

Pretty sure he’s got about a thousand different ways to say it, too.

When so many things are (wrong/broken) with the world...?

Sometimes you need somebody to show you the ropes, in terms of how to tell some people to fuck off.
With adamant conviction. Just throw out as many fuck-off-phenomenons as you can, in the least amount of time.
I mean, there really is quite a wide variety of ways to say it, ya know...?

Do you say it with some edginess in your voice...? Short, bombastic and succinct...? 
“Hey pal, fuck off already.”

Or, do you just say it CASUALLY...? 
Like, let’s say you’re laying on the couch during a hot day... you’re waitin’ for the ice cream guy to drive 
around the neighborhood, and you don’t really feel like moving until you rip open one of those ice cream cookie
sandwiches or chocolate eclairs... so, until you get one of them, maybe you’ll say it without much energy... 
“Meh, fuck off bruh.” 

MAYBE... after you get your ice cream sandwich or whatever, NOW you can say it with force... 
“Hey bro. How bout *points* you, fuck off *points down* right now...?”

Look, the point isn’t to just have an ALWAYS ready-to-go, version of “fuck off” to haphazardly say to somebody.
Nah, the trick is to practice the delivery for the moments where a properly delivered “Fuck off, bro”, could be
the difference between people thinking you’re a lame bastard, OR, cool as fuck. 

Believe it or not, the phrase “Fuck off” can be thrown into so many variations, it is easy to lose track of them 
all. Maybe you can get it all down to just being able to LOOK at somebody... and when they see the look on your
face...? Well, they KNOW that’s the exact expression written all over it... and they may even say:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Them : Alright dude~! 
       Chill out~! 
       Take the intensity down a notch~!”. 
You  : *then you just gotta mess with em even more*
       I didn’t even SAY anything...
Them : Bro... *head cocked slightly* 
       I know what you were thinkin’ just by that LOOK...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

At that point...? All you even really gotta do, is just LOOK at somebody... and they’ll know what it means.

Anyway, this dude JULIEN ASSANGE has probably spent his entire life figuring out the ins and outs, of how to say
those words in every way he can muster... and you know what...? I think that’s cool as fuck.

This dude is a picture-perfect candidate for somebody who knows EXACTLY how to tell a long list of fuck faces,
“Hey bro. Fuck off already.”

Guy doin’ some shit he’s not supposed to be doin’...? 
Julien’s gonna tell that dude:
“Hey dude, fuck off already... Shit’s gettin’ quite old already.”

Is there someone else comin’ around to try and catch him off guard, and surprise him from behind...?
Nah, I don’t think so. Julien saw that shit comin’ from like a mile away, bro. Guess what he’s gonna say...?
“Look chum, you better fuck off with THAT shit...”

Yeah, I’m hyperbolizing this dude quite a lot, but this dude has a fuckin’ huge nutsack to have done what he did.
And, I think that’s worthy of some respect right there. 

When I was just a young lad, I wasn’t quite sure I would ever find myself saying those words as often as I do...? 
But, now I’m an adult, and I basically say them every day.

Hillary Rodham Clinton, SOMEHOW isn’t in prison, nor jail, nor do I believe James Comey even like, lightly 
slapped her on the wrist for *ANYTHING*, and you know what...? She basically did the same exact thing that 
Assange did. There’s a very large difference in the punishment here. Wanna know how COOL that is, to me...?

It’s SOOO cool that I really don’t give a flying fuck, THAT’s how cool. 
Well, saying I don’t give a flying fuck about the situation is sort-of inaccurate...
...because I see a really strong case of INJUSTICE.

INJUSTICE (NOUN: <LACK> of FAIRNESS or JUSTICE.)

Honestly, it’s probably not <Hillary’s fault> that this dude is in prison. She might have some say in how 
long he stays in that prison cell...? But ultimately, I don’t think it was her that made the choice to 
prosecute/extradite him to the United States. 

Still... it’s not like everything this woman ever did has fallen on deaf ears, or whatever. This woman has 
done plenty of good deeds in her life, she did a lot to get Bill elected President, and he did a damn good job
as far as I’m concerned. He didn’t do that job without her help. So, I’m really ON THE FENCE with how I feel 
about this woman in particular, because she is by no means the worst person in the world. For example...?

Vladimir Putin, a man who was born to be the most moronic fuckfaced clown boys ever seen in history.
I really thought that Trump was bad...? But Putin is about 10 times worse than Trump, even on his worst fuckin’ 
day. And it’s not like Trump ISN’T bad, he fuckin definitely is, egregious, feels like he tries to make himself 
an exception all the time, and it sorta looks like he’s in deep shit with the January 6th, 2021 committee/trials.

Regardless... Hillary WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY been a better pick for the job. Without a doubt. 
That’s not what I was most concerned about when I didn’t vote for her. 
The problem is that there’s a line that got crossed in terms of who I felt I could trust. 
Because when an FBI man doesn’t do anything about the email situation, but then Assange gets a 175 year dick 
shoved in his asshole, unwillingly...?

I have a serious fuckin’ problem with that. Because most people in society don’t actually give a flying fuck 
about what’s TRUE, or FALSE. I’m dead serious. Doctors, judges, lawyers, police officers, politicians, FBI agents, 
it seems like nobody gives a flying fuck about the truth, and it’s causing so many problems...
...that I had to write this fuckin’ document to make my opinion very fuckin’ clear.

Hillary is actually a saint compared to TRUMP or PUTIN... even on her worst day, compared to either one of them 
cocksuckers. Doesn’t change the fact that she’s not on my favorite list of people because of SEVERAL things this 
lady has done. First of all, I suspect that she may have had some hand in the murder attempt on 05/26/20, outside 
of the CATRICALA FUNERAL HOME. Because I thought long and hard about the list of people I had spoken about at or 
about that date, and her name is DEFINITELY on that list. But then again, so are a lot of other people. 

I’m not suggesting that SHE, was one of the (2) dudes that I saw, because that is fuckin’ outrageous.

However, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Body_Count it is pretty obvious that there is a long line of dead
bodies in this woman’s wake. As far as Epstein goes...? I think he had something like that coming. But I don’t
think that it’s really a MORAL thing to do, to just raise a hand inconspicuously like she does, and somehow that’s
basically her signature Carmella Soprano “Go ahead”. Then a soldier in the shadows moves like the wind, unseen...
Like a well oiled machine, everything moves like clockwork. This lady doesn’t have to break a sweat.

She could be right in the middle of eating a slice of Key Lime pie, she starts eating it and puts the bib on.
That’s when she made the hand gesture of doom for Carl.
While she’s got 20K cameramen snapping pictures of her, with her husband Bill, eating this slice of Key Lime pie...
Well, someone’s gettin’ taken out downstairs.
By the time she puts the fork down...? Well, someone was GREENLIT to be killed, and the deed was done.

5 minutes after she’s put the fork down and taken off...? 
Well, everybody has to put on a real show, and pretend like they’re shocked and surprised...
Carl went down into the kitchen a while ago.
LOOKS like he must’ve had a heart attack or somethin’...
NOW, Hillary is told about the death of Carl... and a few days later, she’s at his funeral.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Hillary : Jeez. 
          RIP Carl. 
          You were an awesome dude...
          *crocodile tears*
          The world just isn’t fair at all... is it...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I’m definitely not being literal or specific by any means here... but then again, who really doubts that this 
woman would ever have to work THAT hard, to do something like that...? I mean, she is the former first lady.
She will probably be flat out impressed with how creative I am, and how spot on that creativity truly is...

Bill, is still alive and kicking. Minus the Whitewater scandal and being a relatively low profile lame duck in 
his last couple years, he was a damn good president. He still lied to everybody about what happened. I’m not 
really sure why I give this lady a hard time to be fair. She deserves plenty of respect... but I still feel 
pretty pissed about JULIEN ASSANGE’s situation. 

She is, without a doubt a lot more intelligent than my own mother... because ya know, my mother isn’t even 
TRYING to get me killed, but she’s almost done so ‘accidentally’ my entire life. My mother didn’t realize 
that my father knew he was being hunted in October 1995, so, my mother fails to accept this, but... she has 
LITERALLY already gotten my father killed. There’s no use in even talking to her about it. She is so far in
denial that it is a lost cause to talk to her about WHAT I REMEMBER my father and mother arguing about when I 
was a 10 year old child.

All things considered, sometimes I realize that most people are spineless scoundrels that have no integrity.
I try not to dwell on that because I don’t want to treat someone who’s never done anything to deserve that 
sort of treatment... to feel like I’m resentful toward everyone all the time... because I’m not. However...?
I see myself in the same fucking position Ed Snowden and JULIEN ASSANGE are in. Yeah, I’m not stuck in Russia
or in prison...? But- I happen to be surrounded by morons every day. Morons that don’t care about what’s right
or wrong. So for instance, it’s ok if MICHAEL ZURLO commits obstruction of justice, and that (2) guys that 
attempted to murder me, they were able to remotely disable my iPhone 8+, and NOW, I know exactly just how fake
this country is from top to bottom.

Even though my father was murdered 25 years ago, I never once thought about getting a gun, and just 
unloading as many bullets as possible in every direction, like Adam Lanza, Stephen Paddock... Or the 
situation in Buffalo, or Uvalde. Never once have I thought “Time to go shoot innocent people for no reason.”

Nah, and you know, I’ve apparently been graded by people that don’t care how consistently they misjudge me. 
For instance, this cocksucker RICHARD TODD LOEBER. This dude, is a total fuckin’ moron. He supposedly has a 
doctorate in psychiatry, but- he really needs to consider going back to school to earn his degree. 

The reason I say that is because he was cutting a lot of corners both times I’ve been to Saratoga Hospital. 
When I say “cutting corners”, what I mean is, someone that has malicious intentions, and was BRIBED by 
somebody to take a shit on my case, by some woman that looked a lot like Kristen Gillibrand in 06/15/20.

Pretty sure it wasn’t HER, but it was a blonde haired woman that looked a lot like her. 

The point being, as pissed off as I can get with people...? I never think to take it out on people that are 
TOTALLY INNOCENT. Quite the contrary, I have to hold myself back, from taking out on people that AREN’T FUCKIN 
INNOCENT AT ALL. I have quite a LOT of restraint, people constantly misjudge me, they don’t realize that I will
get into fights with people who are a lot tougher looking than I am, and in many cases they have no idea how I 
was able to kick the shit out of somebody twice my size. 

Still, I don’t unload a barrage of fists at everybody who even LOOKS at me the wrong way... Nah.      
People commonly placate me, undermine me, gloss over me, minimize me, scoff at my thought process, they belittle 
me, I’m rarely treated with any respect... I really don’t get it. I spent a long time busting my ass, and people 
just kept taking advantage of me. 

Then, after I’ve had enough of people expecting me to do all of this work, I’m supposed to get what I’m owed, and
it is literally like a dog just shit in the house and the dog doesn’t want to look at the shit pile it just left.
That is a great analogy for how people choose to respect me in return. 

I think the reason why is because I’m more intelligent than most people, so they constantly confuse me for 
having some type of screw loose, right...? They hear me talking about things like the double slit experiment, 
the universe is a simulation, superposition or entanglement, or maybe even stuff Karl Sagan would say. 

Once people hear me talk like that...? I think the gods honest truth is that people really are morons and they 
think all of that shit sounds insane. I’m not kidding. I think that is exactly what it is.

Look, not everyone is a moron. But when I talk to people, they never pick up on the fact that I am 95% of the
time, more intelligent than the person that is talking to me. Dead serious. I need to hang out with people
that have a much higher IQ.

This lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton...? She would earn my respect by doing something to get Assange out of his
ordeal. But- I cannot expect that at all considering that he was rather invasive with the WAY in which he leaked
those “classified emails”.

Still, I don’t think the punishment fits the crime here at all. 
Assange’s ordeal is a direct attack against the constitution itself, the first amendment and freedom of the press.

His situation, and Snowden’s situation causes me to think: 

Maybe someone should just burn the constitution.
Nobody knows what it says anyway.
If people lose their rights, they won’t care until it’s too late.
They won’t care BEFORE that.
People in control of the government are experts at sucking ass at running it.
Each year that goes by, I see this extinction level event becoming more and more of an inevitability.
Too many morons to stop. 
Nobody gives a shit.
Humanity is a lost fucking cause.

Yeah, see, if I start with the negative rhetoric like that, I’m sure that’s gonna be a Debbie downer for anyone 
who cares about the story. But, I know for damn certain that’s exactly how Snowden has felt for a long time, so
has Assange, and so have a lot of other people, including Monica Lewinski probably.

But I have to hold on to a shred of hope, even if it is practically non-existent...
One way that I get myself out of that negative way of thinking, is to remember... 
Bob Lutz shit his pants every day for 50 years straight when he ran General Motors.
The check that GM got from Obama...? 
Bob spent that on new pants. 
The whole check “Pants for Bob Lutz”.

Assange is a critical piece of this puzzle here, for a reason. Ed Snowden and JULIEN ASSANGE were trying to warn
smart bastards like me, years ago. I sort of understand how oblivious so many people are. Because, I didn’t really
see the WARNING signs until it was nearly too late. CVE-2019-8936, DDOS, Wannacry Ransomware Derivative...?

Well, all of these things tell me that there’s an unavoidable war in the not too distant future. 
A war where we’ll need a cybercommando like JULIEN ASSANGE, and Edward Snowden, if we’re ever gonna win.
The Russians were able to break ALL the way into our most secure systems in December 2020. 
I have a feeling that the next time they break in, it will be too late to stop Armageddon.

$Book.AddSection(8,"WikiLeaks (1)",@"
WikiLeaks was founded by Julien P. Assange, and though I've already explained much about Mr. Assange, the truth
is that the UNITED STATES JUSTICE SYSTEM has decided to FRAME and INCARCERATE him for BEING A JOURNALIST.

He is more than just a journalist, he's essentially the same type of person that I am, as well as Edward Snowden.
The problem, is that PEOPLE DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

If someone is accused of a crime they didn't commit...?
Oh well.
That happens to everybody.

If Hillary Clinton basically ACCIDENTALLY commits espionage through her CARELESS DISREGARD for PROTOCOLS in 
PROTECTING DOCUMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS, and EMAILS pertaining to MATTERS OF NATIONAL SECURITY...?
Oh well.
That happens to everybody.
If she doesn't get charged or prosecuted for it...?
There's nothing that anybody can even do.

Therefore, just DON'T PISS OFF IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENT, NOR A CORPORATION with a LOT OF MONEY...?
And you're good.

If you DO PISS OFF THOSE PEOPLE...?
You're going to prison at some point, OR...?
You'll be killed silently, quietly, and you'll NEVER be found ever again.

They tried to do this shit to ME, on MAY 26th, 2020 at 1602 US-9, CLIFTON PARK, NY 12065.
They prevented my device from being able to CONTACT 911 EMERGENCY SERVICES...
They fuckin' spent the last (2) plus years ignoring THESE (5) fucking videos I recorded on...

05/23/20 | IMG_0413.mov | <insert hyperlink>
05/24/20 | Solar Drive  | <insert hyperlink>

...and in the middle of AVOIDING the EXISTENCE of these fucking videos...?
...they literally attempted to murder me multiple times.

So, for me to make the BOLD, OUTRAGEOUS CLAIM, that it has a LOT to do with CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA, FACEBOOK,
MARK ZUCKERBERG, and various people in the NEW YORK STATE GOVERNMENT, LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM and JUDICIAL 
SYSTEM...?

It is ALL directly resultant, to how many fucking times I've written about JULIEN ASSANGE.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Collateral Murder",@"
Essentially, the biggest slap across the face to military operations in memory, not because the event itself 
is really unexpected or just insanely unbelievable... During war, innocent people do wind up getting killed. 

That’s a compromise that I can make to SOME EXTENT... but you can’t just allow that shit to run rampant.

Someone needs to take accountability for serious mistakes where innocent people get killed for SENSELESS 
REASONS... so for instance, suppose I just keep farting in my underwear, and I never spray any air freshener.
Eventually the whole room will stink, and anyone who walks in will immediately feel like they’re in Bob Lutz’ 
office. Same scenario, basically. Bob Lutz, took a daily shit in his pants, rather than to make quality cars.

Now, apply the same concept, to where the military was being micromanaged by Bob Lutz, where he didn’t care if
he shit his pants every day... Nah. Who the hell are you to come at the guy who directed GM for over 50 years...?
You’d have to have SOME NERVE to come around, and show a mortal like him, how to run a fuckin’ car company...

Now, apply the same concept to the manner in which the military or government CLASSIFIED the video, 
“Collateral Murder”, AS WELL AS DENIAL of the FOIL request that Reuters submitted. Well, that tells me 
that there may be THOUSANDS to MILLIONS of OTHER incidents, EXACTLY LIKE THIS. AND... those incidents 
will never be REVEALED or UNCOVERED.

Here’s the problem. The ship, the RMS Titanic, struck an ICEBERG that was probably 2-5% sticking out of the 
water. So, something very small was seen, but that very small thing that was seen, caused an entire BRAND NEW 
SHIP to sink to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on its maiden voyage, causing Leonardo DiCaprio to have to 
be part of the story as it was retold. Yeah, I mean, I talk about this actor later on in the document, but, 
it’s pretty relevant, and it’s a great analogy.

“Collateral Murder” sickens me. 
I know that the military will classify events such as this, and I have no doubt in my mind that the other 
agencies in the government do this shit too. Most notably the (CIA/Central Intelligence Agency).

Vault 7 is a series of hacking tools that were developed by the Central Intelligence Agency, and sometimes these 
tools are used by other agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and even the National Security 
Agency. I’m certain that there are plenty of GOOD USE CASES for these tools, but the entire point of them ALL, 
is to essentially skull fuck opponents left and right. You’re not likely to be someone as OBSERVANT as myself,

they’ve done to me repeatedly.

The first batch of documents consisting of: 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments, purportedly from the CIA,

WikiLeaks did not name the source, but said that the files had circulated among former US government hackers 
and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.

According to WikiLeaks, the source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, 
proliferation and democratic control of cyber weapons since these tools raise questions that urgently need
to be debated in public (cause they’re IMMORAL), including whether the CIA’s hacking capabilities exceed 
its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency (nobody ever said they were lousy

A CIA back-end infrastructure with a public-facing HTTPS interface used by CIA, to transfer information from
target desktop computers and smartphones to the CIA. Then, it opens those devices to receive further commands

This is a hacking tool co-developed by the (CIA/MI5) used to exploit a series of smart TVs for the purpose of
covert intelligence gathering.

Once installed in suitable televisions with a USB stick, the hacking tool enables those televisions’ built-in
microphones and possibly video cameras to record their surroundings, while the TVs falsely appear to be off.
The recorded data is then either stored locally into the television’s memory or sent over the internet to
the CIA. 

Allegedly both the CIA and MI5 agencies collaborated to develop that malware and coordinated their work in 
Joint Development Workshops. 

As of this part 6 publication, "Weeping Angel" is the second major CIA hacking tool which notably references 
the British television show, Doctor Who, alongside "Sonic Screwdriver" in "Dark Matter".

When a CIA watermarked document is opened, an invisible image within the document that is hosted on the 
agency’s server is loaded, generating a HTTP request.

The request is then logged on the server, giving the intelligence agency information about who is opening 
it and where it is being opened. 

However, if a watermarked document is opened in an alternative word processor the image may be visible to 
the viewer. The documentation also states that if the document is viewed offline or in protected view, the
watermarked image will not be able to contact its home server. 

This is overridden only when a user enables editing.

U.S. SANS Institute instructor Jake Williams analyzed the published documents and alleges that Archimedes 
is a virus previously code-named "Fulcrum". 

According to (cybersecurity expert/ENISA member) Pierluigi Paganini, the CIA operators use Archimedes to 
redirect local area network (LAN) web browser sessions from a targeted computer through a computer controlled 
by the CIA before the sessions are routed to the users. 

This type of attack is known as (MITM/man-in-the-middle).   
With their publication WikiLeaks included a number of hashes that they claim can be used to potentially   
identify the Archimedes virus and guard against it in the future. 

Paganini stated that potential targeted computers can search for those hashes on their systems to check if 
their systems had been attacked by the CIA.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
AFTERMIDNIGHT is a malware installed on a target personal computer and disguises as a DLL file, which is 
executed while the user’s computer reboots. It then triggers a connection to the CIA’s C2 computer, from 
which it downloads various modules to run. 

As for ASSASSIN, it is VERY SIMILAR to its AFTERMIDNIGHT counterpart, but deceptively runs inside a 
Windows service process (for instance, explorer.EXE). 

CIA operators reportedly use ASSASSIN as a C2 to execute a series of tasks, collect, and then periodically 
send user data to the CIA Listening Post(s) (LP). Similar to backdoor Trojan behavior. 

Both AFTERMIDNIGHT and ASSASSIN run on [Windows (Client/Server) OS], are PERSISTENT, and periodically 
beacon to their configured LP to either request tasks or send private information to the CIA, as well as 
automatically uninstall themselves on a set date and time.

The published user guide, demo, and related documents were created between September 2015 and February 2016. 

They are all about a malware allegedly developed for the CIA in August 2015, roughly one month after 
Microsoft released Windows 10 with their firm statements about how difficult it was to compromise. 

Both the primary ATHENA malware and its secondary malware named HERA are similar in theory to GRASSHOPPER 
and AFTERMIDNIGHT malware but with some significant differences. 

One of those differences is that ATHENA and HERA were developed by the CIA with a New Hampshire private 
corporation called SIEGE TECHNOLOGIES. During a Bloomberg 2014 interview the founder of SIEGE TECHNOLOGIES

Another difference is in the types of encryption used between the infected computers and the CIA LP. 

As for the similarities, they exploit persistent DLL files to create a backdoor to communicate with CIA’s LP, 
steal private data, then send it to CIA servers, or delete private data on the target computer, as well as C2 
for CIA operatives to send additional malicious software to further run specific tasks on the attacked computer.

All of the above designed to deceive computer security software. 
Beside the published documents, WikiLeaks hasn’t provided evidence to suggest the CIA uses ATHENA, or not.

This tool serves as a persistent implant affecting Windows machines with shared folders. 

It serves as a file system filter driver on an infected computer, and listens for (SMB/Server Message Block)
traffic while detecting download attempts from other computers on a local network. 

PANDEMIC will answer a download request on behalf of the infected computer. However, it’ll replace the legit 
file with malware. In order to obfuscate its activities, PANDEMIC only (modifies/replaces) the legit file in
transit, leaving the original on the server unchanged. 

The implant allows 20 files to be modified at a time, with a maximum individual file size of 800MB. 

While not stated in the leaked documentation, it is possible that newly infected computers could themselves
become "Pandemic" file servers, allowing the implant to reach new targets on a local network.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
BRUTAL KANGAROO is a tool suite for MICROSOFT WINDOWS that targets closed networks by air-gap jumping using
thumb drives. BRUTAL KANGAROO components create a custom covert network within the target closed network, and
providing functionality for executing surveys, directory listings, and arbitrary executables. 

The documents describe how a CIA operation can infiltrate a closed network (or a single air-gapped computer)
within an organization or enterprise without direct access. It first infects a Internet-connected computer 
within the organization (referred to as PRIMARY HOST) and installs the BRUTAL KANGAROO malware on it. 

When a user is using the primary host and inserts a USB stick into it, the thumb drive itself is infected with
a separate malware. If this thumb drive is used to copy data between the closed network and the LAN/WAN, the
user will sooner or later plug the USB disk into a computer on the closed network. 

By browsing the USB drive with Windows Explorer on such a protected computer, it also gets infected with
exfiltration/survey malware. If multiple computers on the closed network are under CIA control, they form 
a covert network to coordinate tasks and data exchange. Although not explicitly stated in the documents, 
this method of compromising closed networks is very similar to how Stuxnet worked.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
ELSA is a geolocation malware for WiFi-enabled devices like laptops running the MICROSOFT WINDOWS operating
system. Once PERSISTENTLY installed on a target machine using separate CIA exploits, the malware scans visible 
WiFi access points, and records the ESS identifier, MAC address and signal strength at regular intervals. 

Side point : I’ve made a program using POWERSHELL that does SOME of this... It has a XAML-Based GUI.
https://github.com/mcc85s/FightingEntropy/blob/main/Functions/Search-WirelessNetwork.ps1
In fact, here’s a 5m demonstration - (Wireless Network Scanning Utility – https://youtu.be/35EabWfh8dQ)

To perform the data collection, the target machine does not have to be online or connected to an access 
point, it only needs to be running with an enabled WiFi device. 

If it is connected to the internet, the malware automatically tries to use public geolocation databases 
from GOOGLE or MICROSOFT to resolve the position of the device and stores the longitude and latitude data 
along with the timestamp. The collected access point/geolocation information is stored in encrypted form 
on the device for later exfiltration. 

The malware itself does not beacon this data to a CIA back-end, instead the operator must actively retrieve 
the log file from the device - again using separate CIA exploits and back-doors. 

The ELSA project allows the customization of the implant to match the target environment and operational
objectives like sampling interval, maximum size of the log file and invocation/persistence method. 

Additional back-end software (again using public geolocation databases from GOOGLE and MICROSOFT) converts
unprocessed access point information from exfiltrated log files to geolocation data to create a tracking 
profile of the target device.

ANGEL FIRE is an implant comprised of five components: SOLARTIME, WOLFCREEK, KEYSTONE (previously MAGICWAND),
BADMFS, and the WINDOWS TRANSITORY FILE SYSTEM. Like previously published CIA projects (GRASSHOPPER +
AFTERMIDNIGHT) in the VAULT 7 series, it is a PERSISTENT FRAMEWORK that can LOAD/EXECUTE custom implants on
TARGET COMPUTERS running the MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM (XP/7). 

SOLARTIME modifies the partition boot sector, so that when WINDOWS LOADS BOOT TIME DEVICE DRIVERS, it ALSO
(LOADS/EXECUTES) the WOLFCREEK implant- once executed...? It can (LOAD/RUN) other ANGELFIRE implants. 

According to the documents, the loading of additional implants creates MEMORY LEAKS that can be possibly 
detected on INFECTED MACHINES. KEYSTONE is part of the WOLFCREEK implant, and responsible for starting 
MALICIOUS USER APPLICATIONS. *Loaded implants never touch the file system*, so there’s very little forensic 
evidence that the process was ever ran (except in the event viewer). 

It always disguises as C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\SVCHOST.EXE, and can thus be detected in the Windows Task Manager,
if the OPERATING SYSTEM is installed on ANOTHER partition, or in a different path. 

BADMFS is a library that implements a COVERT FILE SYSTEM that is CREATED at the END of the ACTIVE PARTITION 
(or in a file on disk in later versions). It is used to store ALL drivers and implants that WOLFCREEK will 
start. All files are both ENCRYPTED and OBFUSCATED to AVOID string or PE header scanning. 

Some versions of BADMFS can be DETECTED, because the REFERENCE to the COVERT FILE SYSTEM is stored in a file
named ZF. 

The WINDOWS TRANSITORY FILE SYSTEM is the NEW method of installing ANGEL FIRE. 
Rather than lay independent components on disk, the system allows an operator to create TRANSITORY FILES for
SPECIFIC ACTIONS including: | INSTALLATION | ADDING/REMOVING FILES from ANGEL FIRE | ETC. |

Transitory files are added to the "UserInstallApp".

Indeed, there is NO EXPLICIT INDICATION why it is part of the project repositories of the CIA/EDG, at all. 

The Protego project is a PIC-based missile control system that was developed by Raytheon. 
The documents indicate that the system is installed on-board a Pratt & Whitney aircraft (PWA) equipped with
missile launch systems air-to-(air and/or ground). 

Protego consists of separate micro-controller units that exchange data and signals over encrypted 
and authenticated channels: On-board TWA are the (MP/Master Processor) and the (DB/Deployment Box). 

Both systems are laid out with (MASTER/SLAVE) redundancy.
The missile system has micro-controllers for the missile itself (MSS/Missile Smart Switch), 
the tube (TSS/Tube Smart Switch), and the collar (which holds the missile before and at launch time). 

The MP unit receives (3) signals from a beacon: 
- In Border (PWA is within the defined area of an operation)
- Valid GPS (GPS signal available) 
- No End of Operational Period (current time is within the defined time-frame for an operation)

Missiles can ONLY be launched, if ALL signals received by MP are set to TRUE. 
Similarly, safeguards are in place to auto-destruct (encryption + authentication) keys for various 
scenarios (leaving a target area of operation/missing missile).

Some of them have been used BENEVOLENTLY.

ARCHIMEDES and AFTER MIDNIGHT are two tools that I know for damn certain they’ve used against me.
These tools will RARELY BE USED on someone that works for somebody and is VERY OBEDIENT, and NOT OBSERVANT.
EVEN IF THEY WERE TO BE USED, most people in society will NOT be OBSERVANT enough, to DETECT THEIR USAGE.

In fact, here is a link to an actual, honest-to-god, legitimate, for real, 100% true, accurate...
...observation I’ve made of (ARCHIMEDES - https://youtu.be/QP25FbNhakQ)

Even Linus Sebastian, the guy who runs LINUS MEDIA GROUP… would have NO FUCKING CLUE WHATSOEVER, if someone
thought to use these tools to attack him or sabotage his business/company, family life, social status, etc.

The mere fact that I know that is the name of the program that was used... 
...means that I’m a lot more important than people seem to think.

Almost as if I have more than just a SUSPICION that Zuckerberg is doing some real shady questionable shit.
ARCHIMEDES is essentially when I have a session to the internet, or Windows. And, everything is port-mirrored
and copied to a virtual machine that is replicating ALL of the changes I’m making in any given session. 

AFTER MIDNIGHT is a tool that reaches out to the internet to a C2 server for additional scripts and exploits to 
download and execute themselves. It is typically used with Assassin. But also, Grasshopper and Marble, used to 
distribute malware as well as obfuscate programs so that it’s source cannot be attributed. 
Then there’s also Athena and Hera which commandeer DNS and RSAT.

Yeah, I did a little digging thanks to WikiLeaks, mainly because I’ve seen some shit happening that I thought
was LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE... but nah. It was damn possible after all.

I called the National Security Agency way back in the summer of 2019, and AFTER that, I noticed that I went to

WEEPING (ANGEL/WILLOW) is something that I was interviewed about, by (Andrew Banas - Https://youtu.be/bPdWt7kcd3M)

I don’t think HE realized that the hackers were actually exploiting WEEPING WILLOW, to distribute software
that allows the microphone to anyone’s SmartTV to become a surveillance tool for WHOEVER. 
So, investigators use that, but also the hackers use it too so they can try and get access to people’s accounts, 
or get access to their information on that device. 

The scariest thing about this software, is that THE MICROPHONE WILL STILL RECORD THE ENVIRONMENT EVEN IF THE TV

...then they’ll be SAD cause I know how cool it is, but apparently they didn’t make it...

This thing saved my life on May 26th, 2020.
What if I could join forces with this drone, and just, mess up every bad guy’s day...?
Sucks, that I don’t know who would’ve made something so cool, and unique.

It seemed like it might’ve been malicious AT FIRST, when I ran into it on May 21st-22nd 2020 (see The ‘Week’)
However, it’s probably possible that it’s just like any other tool... it can be dangerous or helpful.
It allowed me to understand: 
- (2) 25-30 year old, EXTREMELY GAY LOOKING BROTHERS white males wearing glasses, hats, backpacks
- were (following/stalking/prowling) me
- on foot after almost striking me with their vehicle during the audio recording I uploaded (faggots)
- had my smartphone hacked with a DEADLY TOOL that I would later discovery was named PHANTOM/PEGASUS
- EXTREMELY GAY LOOKING (just making sure that detail isn’t glossed over, they take inspiration from GWB)

I believe that PHANTOM/PEGASUS is deployed to ALL devices, from the factory. 
Or, there’s some variation in stating HOW it’s existence, propagates to new smartphone devices.

When I told the police about this, they’re either:
________________________________________________________________
| morons | acting like morons (but are they REALLY acting...?) |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I believe that the Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office facilitated an attempted murder that night, and that:
- most of the organization is absolutely clueless
- someone has been keeping so many details a secret
- such as SCSO (Scott Schelling/James Leonard/MICHAEL ZURLO)
- the organization has AT LEAST 1 double-agent Russian intel officer, working for them
- they don’t actually give a shit if that IS the truth, believe it or not
- cause if they did, they’d ask me how I would know that
- has a history of (being oblivious/not writing facts correctly in nearly every report)
- not ALL of them have this mentality, some of them prefer to be seen as PROFESSIONALS in my eyes (kinda rare)

But, I’ve spoken about many of these things already.
I also believe that the (2) guys that attempted to attack me on 5/26/2020, they happen to be serial killers.
Pretty sure they’re part of the hidden government.
They made several attempts over the course of several days, from (5/22/20 → 5/26/20), to kill me.

However it was less obvious to me that it had happened prior, as one of them attempted to lunge at me...
...from the Orenda Exercise trail on May 23rd, 2020.

As for (05/25/20 2343 → 05/26/20 0010), I placed (2) 911 calls. (2) guys were following me.
I was recording a video for a while, of my interaction with one of these guys, with a dialog like this:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me  : Hey, man how’s it going? You from around here...?
Him : Yeah, but I moved away for a while and then I came back.
Me  : Oh cool. Did you know Catricala’s been putting bodies into concrete foundations and stuff...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
        
This kid heard damn well what I said, but pretended like he was confused.
Then, he eventually looked at his device, and when he did, his reaction was very telling.
He fuckin’ DEFINITELY had some US Military black ops “Vault 7”-grade shit connected to my device. 
A phone with no service, one that recorded a video with:
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
| our entire interaction | close-up view of his face | sound of his voice | his reaction once he found out... |
| ...I was aiming the camera right at him | black Dodge (Dart/Charger) he drove out of the Mobil parking lot  |
| the second dude who ran out of the laundromat and started chasing me, originally came from Grecian Gardens  |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Yeah. I recorded a video of these dipshits using Pegasus back on 05/26/20.
I didn’t know what the hell it was called, but I knew this thing was jamming my 911 calls.
I recorded in multiple videos BEFOREHAND, that I knew it was there.

Almost as if, I spoke about it being on my device in MULTIPLE VIDEOS THAT I ALREADY RECORDED, for instance:
1) In the video I recorded about an hour after ME and my SON, MICHAEL C COOK JR were walking behind 
Cheryl’s Lodge and JOHN FUCKIN’ HOFFMAN stops and tells me and my son that he has a SECURITY TEAM that SHOWS UP
before the POLICE DO, in the event that SOMEONE STEALS MONEY FROM HIS ACCOUNT, which the police don’t show up,
you fuckin’ moron. NOPE. They don’t show up at all...

...that video was ME, walking to my AUNT TERRI COOK’s HOUSE at: 10 INNISBROOK, CLIFTON PARK, NY 12065

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
2) THEN, I recorded a SECOND video, walking from 10 INNISBROOK, CLIFTON PARK NY to...
...the Clifton Park Public Safety Building where the NEW YORK STATE POLICE has a TROOPER BARRACKS...
...not only did I record an ADDITIONAL VIDEO WHERE TROOPERS LEAVE THEIR VEHICLES RUNNING IDLE...
...UNATTENDED IN GROUPS OF 3 or 4...
...BUT THAT ALSO, I STATED IN THE FUCKING VIDEO, THAT THE PROGRAM WAS ALREADY ON MY DEVICE.

You would be AMAZED as to how many SLOW PEOPLE there just so happens to be, in a town I grew up in and spent ALMOST 
my entire life. It’s called CLIFTON PARK, NEW YORK 12065. But hey, I make recordings talking about stuff for a reason.

The other videos I had ALREADY, would paint a very clear picture of how these programs are all connected to:
    _________________________________________________________________________________________
    | USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001 | National Surveillance Act of 2006 | PRISM | Pegasus/Phantom |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
THEN, when I showed the video of (2) dipshits using PEGASUS/PHANTOM to NYS Trooper Leavey on 05/27/20 ~0900...?
Well, these assholes disabled my device remotely. (← Almost as if someone is ASKING to be KILLED very VIOLENTLY).
My PHONE was DISABLED by the MANUFACTURER, to commit: OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. That’s a perfect reason for violence.

When I say “Almost as if someone is ASKING to be KILLED very VIOLENTLY...?”
Well, what I mean is that there aren’t enough bullets in the entire planet, for the MILITARY FIRING SQUAD, to unload
them at a target that they have been instructed to EXECUTE WITH EXTREME PREDJUDICE. That sort of very violently.

OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE is basically when someone commits a crime and (destroys/tampers with) evidence.
The reason why Pegasus/Phantom is as deadly as it is, is that it allows the police to destroy your evidence.
If I didn’t already know that a lawsuit would be a total waste of time, that’s what I would’ve done already.
They disabled my device for MULTIPLE REASONS, not just cause I showed Trooper Leavey the video...	

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Using Pegasus to connect to my device that had no service, they were BROADCASTING the content of my device...
...and this was happening AFTER I went to S.A.N.G. 

When the police try to tell me what I’m saying sounds crazy...? 
I have to express somehow, without making them cry a lot...
...that maybe it just SOUNDS crazy.
Cause, if something SOUNDS crazy, that MUST mean that it IS crazy... (← FALLACY ALERT)
I’m just kidding... 
Things can SOUND crazy, but so long as they’re ACCURATE, then it’s worth making some suggestions...
...that it’s not crazy at all if it’s the truth.

Because you gotta consider, maybe they need to be insulted when they say shit like that.

Someone from a federal agency with a back door key to radio equipment made by Capital Digitronics (who 
provides equipment the New York State Police)... they probably heard something Leavey said, and that’s 
when they issued a command to disable my device. 

I’m not sure why it would sound hard to believe, considering that I had other interactions with the FBI 
beforehand, or that I spoke about Capital Digitronics late on 05/25/20 when I uploaded (3) audio recordings 
to my Google Drive account from the network at Computer Answers... right before the (2) dudes tried to kill me.

Then, some people with sunglasses kept following me on foot when I walked to the FBI field office.
That may have actually been coincidental.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Days earlier (05/19/20 – 05/21/20), I kept recording some things that somebody in particular, didn’t really 
care for. Over and over again... Because I had a feeling that somebody had been listening to me for YEARS, 
ESPECIALLY after CVE-2019-8936 and a ransomware attack on January 15th, 2019. 

Some slick cybercriminal decided to attack Computer Answers, 3 years, never once saw anything like it. 
The recordings I kept making, I just kept expressing my train of thought. 
Then one night I heard this "bird" that sounded like no fuckin’ bird that I’ve ever heard in my entire life, 
and I’ve never met anyone that actually listens to the recording, and can tell me what type of bird it is. 

Not one time has it ever happened, so, maybe in the year 3302, they’ll find out: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

3302 : Oh, Michael C. Cook born in 1985.
3302 : Recorded this fuckin’ ‘bird’ and spent the rest of his life...
       ...trying to get someone else to listen to the recording. 
       It appears as if this dude made first contact with alien life forms.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I’m not saying that’s definitely what it is, but even if it were, nobody seems to give a shit.

As I continued recording videos, making audio logs, somebody sent this device to the fenced in area behind the 
old county courthouse across from Snyder’s in Clifton Park. Why did they do this...? Because somebody listened 
to those audio logs, and they heard me audibly state the location, and the content of the sign from the 
Historical Society. 

In fact, people might find this really hard to believe, but, I’m an expert at being able to manipulate people.
I believe that remote party was ANONYMOUS, or CICADA, (cause I mentioned them in the audio recordings) and 
someone was trying to WARN me.

I believe that the military engaged an uplink to my device at or about the night I walked to 
(SANG/Stratton Air National Guard), so that they could access the content of my device. 

I believe that these (2) guys, were part of a TEAM of people, who had remote access/control of my: 
_________________________________________________________________
| Laptop | Server | Gateway | Switch | Smartphone | Cable Modem |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Someone didn’t like the fact that I would STILL be able to record something and get it passed them somehow.

I have a video, of a blue car passing me in Jonesville, back on 05/23/20, right next to the Fire station, 
and the reason why I walked all over the place is totally irrelevant, because, I was just manipulating this 
security team to keep making mistakes that I was recording. They made fatal mistake after fatal mistake, and 
their only defense now, is hoping that nobody sees all of my evidence. 

One of the most fatal mistakes they made, was merging the data between (2) separate video files, causing me 
to remember "our dreams are our ability to perceive time backwards". Then, the lens on the smartphone losing 
focus when a blue car passed me. Pretty sure it was a blue Nissan Sentra, but maybe not. The camera lost focus 
because my device (with no service whatsoever) was being remotely controlled through a COMMAND LINE INTERFACE, 
to lose focus as the vehicle passed me. 

There would be 0 conditions where a camera loses focus like it does in the video, because nothing was 
obstructing the lens to cause that blurriness. (Unless there are other reasons)

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

As for 05/26/20, SCSO Scott Schelling stated something that allowed me to determine with sheer certainty, 
that SCSO probably facilitated the attempted murder that night, and this guy SCSO Scott Schelling, responded 
to a call for service that Stratton Air National Guard called in on (05/22/20 → 05/23/20).

Scott did seem to give a shit if I called 911 AT FIRST, but later changed his attitude. 
Scott did not seem to give a shit if I cut Zackary Karel’s phone line at 1769 Route 9.
Or, moved the sign for the embroidery shop across the street to the mailbox pole at 1774 Route 9
Or, if I had pictures on my phone that would really piss some people off. 

Because, he was most concerned about the reality as to whether I actually, factually:
1) uploaded those audio logs to the internet from Computer Answers
2) uploaded the video of these kids tryin’ to kill me
3) left evidence behind on Center for Security’s surveillance equipment calling 911,
4) caused a disturbance at Key Bank, where someone heard me say something about a second cell phone
             
Scott didn’t write any notes down or anything about these things, but I’ll tell ya, it still makes a perfect 
fucking alibi. SCSO James Leonard felt like changing the time I was in that area. So now the alibi won’t work, 
because that’s what the police do when they want to fit certain details into a narrative, they don’t care if 
they’re wrong at all.

But what winds up happening, is that Eric Catricala, Zackary Karel, and James Leonard all earned a lot of my 
attention. Someone might start to feel afraid when I state that I’ll have a gun next time, because it’s not 
really a bad idea. Or, I start talking about serial killers that keep getting away with what they’re doin’.

THEN, when I request records from SCSO, and I see the report Catricala called in, and how Eric said a bunch 
of stuff about Computer Answers, inserts some stuff I didn’t say, and then it leaves out Bruce Tanski...?

THEN, now I know exactly what the fuck I’m dealing with, don’t I? What if I could do that, call the police,
and SAY that a couple of assholes tried to kill me a few minutes BEFORE Scott Schelling arrived at Zappone...? 
It’ll be the truth...

But, I’m not Eric Catricala. So, Eric Catricala could have been involved in trying to have me killed... and 
none of that shit is ever processed or recorded. Weird. The thing is, I’m pretty sure Catricala wasn’t involved 
in that at all, pretty sure Tanski wasn’t involved in that either. But, maybe they were.

What I do think, is that I have to set better traps for next time.

Wouldn’t be much of a stretch for me to assume that these things might actually ALL be RELATED.

______________________________________________________________________
| Oil companies, were probably responsible for the towers collapsing |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    - the people that demolished the (3) buildings, they’re treasonists. 

That’s why the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001 → was written.
The USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001, allows technology to be manipulated by the feds, and they can lie to anybody too.
If they do that, then they basically are a monarchy.

The reason Assange is in prison, is because the CIA works very closely with the gas/oil companies and they 
wanted him badly. Just like I suspect that they sent a rather inexperienced crew, to try and get me a few times... 

...and they failed the job. That was probably the FBI and the CIA wasn’t involved at all. 
BUT- NOW I know that they fuckin’ DEFINITELY ARE. 
The Central Intelligence Agency, is DEFINITELY FUCKING INVOLVED, and they’ve made it pretty clear...
...they have NO plans on the table, to invite ME, to ANY of their birthday parties, ever.

But, I don’t really fuckin’ care.

Now they have to give orders to people at the county and state level, to slander me in every way possible.
So, what I’m suggesting is that Paul Pellagalli probably took orders or a bribe. Among many others.

There are other reasons, but I think the most notable exception to make here is that if/when the world runs out 
of oil, these companies won’t have much of a lifespan after that.
That is, if the world doesn’t get thrown into a cauldron bubble and melt everybody on the planet first. 

What it tells me is that I have to find an extremely compelling way, to cause people to think about what’s in 
their best interest, without explicitly threatening anyone specifically... Maybe generally.
        
Anyone reading this that has any intelligence, they’re going to reread those paragraphs.
I can stand to be corrected that... maybe I have some stuff wrong.
RARELY do people bother to do that, and IF THEY DO, they never succeed at convincing me otherwise.
Mainly because they don’t ask me questions like “you said you have pictures or something...?”
Yeh.

If I tell someone I have pictures of (2) dudes that I believe are SERIAL KILLERS, well, why don’t people ask 
to see those fuckin’ pictures...? The reason is because they aren’t smart enough to be able to do that, they 
think I’m insane. Pretty moronic thing to do, accuse someone that’s just a lot more (observant/intelligent) 
than other people, insane.

However, what I don’t have wrong, is that I’ve been piecing this together for many years.
Every time I contacted the FBI or the NSA, they never said anything in response to my accusations. 
I will say this, these people really do have a lot of resolve. Some of them have caught a lot
of flak, because someone on their team wasn’t playing by the rules.

If you’re like me and you call them like I did in January 2020 speaking to some woman from Virginia, and 
tell her that Nfrastructure is doing something to my computer... She’s gonna tell me to call the local office 
the following morning. And that is when I first spoke to Investigator Christopher Murphy. I don’t think this
dude is a good guy. Cause between the call I made the night before, and calling him the following morning,
my server sustained a DDOS attack.

It’s very telling, that I was on the right track all along, and that the little subtleties 
along the way, caused me to compile a pretty effective and compelling list of factors. I believe that at some 
point, however... some of them started helping me out. The reason I think that has to do with the multiple 
times I’ve seen phenomenon that bears no other explanation than... “Someone’s definitely helpin’ me out.”

Some of those factors include:

In May 2020, I suspected that Bell Atlantic, Spectrum, and Verizon, were doing some shady shit, and took a 
bunch of pictures all around the town of Clifton Park. Guys like Trooper Carter will think that shit was 
something a crazy person would do, but it’s probably one of those situations where I have to explain a joke
to someone that’s mentally challenged, cause they didn’t get the punchline of the joke... there was a motive 
that he and the whole crew of his... made no effort to investigate. 
Then I remember the drone that was following me around...

Then, I remember somebody was intercepting my files as I was uploading them, (which they were doing to me back 
around January 2019) and the team of people that had been following me around for quite some time even well 
before that. I had a feeling that someone was actively violating my rights and such as far back as October 2018, 
if not before that.

Effectively, I could sit here and write these words over and over again, I know what’s bound to happen.
Some people in America committed treason in exchange for converting the country into a monarchy.
That is why I have been aggressively censored and have had my social media exposure tuned so low.

They don’t do that shit to people who openly state "LOL WOW THIS DUDE IS NUTS, LOL".
Nah, they know those people aren’t very intelligent, and as such, they’re not a threat.
They actually respect me more than those people, because they really like when they have a CHALLENGE.
This is why I call people like Trooper Carter fucking useless.
    
Technically... I want to say things like “I don’t really care if he gets shot or not, frankly.”
But- I’d really rather he didn’t, because I don’t think that he’s done anything to deserve it.
But, he said that "You obviously did something to deserve being in this position...”
“...so if Pelagalli took custody of your kids away, good."
And he’s right to SOME extent, but not in a way where he made an intelligent statement.
I did do something to deserve being in this position.
I pissed off someone that likes to play god.
Then, that person tried to (have me killed/kill me themselves), not even really exaggerating that at all.

When it concerns either Trooper Carter, or Judge Pellagalli, these idiots don’t know that’s the truth.
So, if HILLARY CLINTON told the FBI to not put her in prison, and SHE tried to have me killed, well...?
Obviously these guys aren’t gonna realize how (moronic/possible) that sentence is, or even portions of it.
I don’t think she did that at all. Someone else definitely fuckin’ did, though.
MAYBE... nobody was trying to kill me at all. And, my 911 calls those were imagined and made up.
So are the pictures I have of these (2) dudes that were following... those images are also imagined, right...?

Ah... nah. None of that shit was imagined or delusional at all.
SO, WITH THAT SAME LOGIC OF THEIRS, if some random asshole shoots them down at a grocery store...
...then, they obviously must’ve done SOMETHING to deserve that too, right...?

Otherwise they wouldn’t have gotten shot...
Yeah, they got shot by a fuckin’ psychopath, that’s what they did to deserve that.
It probably sounds like I’m being an asshole when I state it exactly like Trooper Carter did...

Sounds fuckin’ moronic when you read that out loud, doesn’t it?
The reason why it sounds moronic, is because it fuckin’ most definitely is.
Nobody deserves that shit. Well, can’t say NOBODY, cause there’s some evil fucks out there, after all...

But- that is how Trooper Carter and Judge Pelagalli think, among a long list of other people too.

Let me state this to make myself perfectly clear.
Sometimes people get what they don’t deserve at all, and I am in that fucking category.

The problem is that, a long chain of morons...? They exist, alright.
I’m not going to say that I hope this person or that person, get shot to death for being a fucking moron.
But I definitely am a firm believer, that people who act like they’re above the law...?
...if someone ELSE decides to shoot them... 
It will be sad that happened... 
But at the same time, thank fucking god.
Cause the way I see it...? JULIEN ASSANGE, is facing 175 years in prison, because someone thought that was COOL.
Meanwhile, Hillary doesn’t face a single day in jail or even court. WEIRD.

Cause some people haven’t YET gotten, what they fuckin’ definitely deserve.
For instance, Prince Andrew, is a moron. He deserves some prison time, alright.
Also, Andrew Cuomo should be in jail. 
Weird thing is, he’s not. 
Wanna know why...? 
Morons exist, that’s why.

When I say morons exist...? 
What I mean is that the gay kid keeps hanging out with the hot girl, being an overprotective parent,
cock-blocking her.

Girl wants to fuck some dude...? Let her. 
Don’t be a fuckin’ queer like Andrew Cuomo... he’s probably not even entirely gay... 
...but apparently he tried to hook up with 11 women, and they all said NO BRO. 

Regardless, if the gay kid allows the girl to hang out with a straight dude...
...she might actually enjoy herself, and get pregnant.
Believe it or not, that is, exactly how reproduction works.

Wanna know how that’s even a remote possibility...? 
Well, it’s cause some guy had sex with her. Loaded her right up, with a solid stream of jizzlings.
Probably sounds like it’s a no brainer... but some people fuckin’ need it explained a bit more.

Gay kid, he can shoot some jizzlings alright. 
Might be able to load up some other DUDE with some, but not a girl.
No way, Jose. 

Not her, nor any other girl...? 
Cause he’s gay, believe it or not.

If he wasn’t gay? He could. 
Since he is...? He can’t.

Sexuality doesn’t work like quantum mechanics... or superposition.
It’s gotta be one or the other, cause it doesn’t make any sense to be both or neither.
    
Moral of the story, gay kids don’t make any fuckin’ sense sometimes.

The thing is, Ted Cruz doesn’t deserve to get shot for no reason at all... 
If you call 911 and tell them that he accepts bribery money from Exxon Mobil, 
the assumption they should be making, is that the man is being raped.
    
Because, if Ted Cruz was PROUD of this happening, he probably would’ve recorded it on video, right...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Things are about to get dicey. 
Exxon Mobil strips down, and starts to spread Teds ass cheeks apart. 
Once Exxon Mobil starts getting down to business with this dude’s asshole...?
...Ted Cruz (senator from Texas) is gonna sound like a woman getting CLOBBERED by a penis.
Destroyed, even.
Filled, with content.
Filled with joy, even.
Whichever way you want to state the obvious, Exxon Mobil is makin’ this man, 
...Ted Cruz (senator from Texas), his bitch.

That’s what guys like Ted Cruz (senator from Texas) are all about.
        
What is not so obvious here, is that ...Ted Cruz (senator from Texas), is a grown ass man... Not a woman. 
Even still, the man is content in allowing Exxon Mobil to have their way, no questions asked really.
While Teds anal cavity was being filled...? So was his bank account.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

For each second of the video, an additional `$100K made it to Ted’s bank account.
Almost like a police officer COULD find out if Exxon Mobil WAS bribing Ted Cruz, 
…but hadn’t thought to check there yet...

This whole scene here, really, is Teds fantasy. 
He was able to live out HIS fantasy, now he can daydream about it for the rest of his life.
    
A video like that would probably be WAY better than any other method at all, at effectively motivating...
Ted Cruz (senator from Texas)
Probably the best motivator in existence, since he’s bound to be embarrassed by the video being publicly distributed.
Then, everyone’s gonna talk about it.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Rich Brat",@"

There’s a rich brat that needs to be pulled down a LOT of pegs, which I go over later in the material.
A specific entity who’s never NAMED 1 time in this entire book, that I’m referring to when I say that phrase.

Well, if someone starts saying dangerous stuff... some rich brat will probably cry.
And just so we’re clear here, I’m not casually shouting that at everybody who’s rich, cause that’s definitely
not the point *taps chest* I’M tryin’ to make.
Nah. 

The point I’m tryin’ to make is that suppose someone with millions of dollars, can buy a license to Pegasus,
right...? And when they do this, they will have purchased a program worth more than `$1M USD, with money that
they never actually earned themselves. Nah, cause mom and dad hooked him up, just throwing money at the kid that 
wants to use Pegasus to be a serial killer and just mow down innocent people for lookin’ at him the wrong way.

All cause he’s gay and doesn’t want anybody to know.

I will talk more about the RICH BRAT in the chapter dedicated to talking about him.

When certain people like any rich brat that ever lived, cries...? 
The police will actually give a shit about that quite a bit... cause some rich brat made a fuckin’ stink. 
That’s the only time the police make the effort to do a LOT of fuckin’ work. 

Because, someone whose mommy and daddy bought everything for them their whole entire life...

...they were too busy sucking on mommy’s breast milk as they were committing crimes, AND killing people...
...and having the mainstream media openly lie to everybody...
...and somehow NOT ONE PERSON was intelligent enough to put an adamant stop to ALL of that. 

So, the rich brat just kept getting away with it...
If a rich brat kills somebody...?
Oh well.
The police didn’t see that happening...

Even IF THE POLICE WITNESS THIS PARTICULAR RICH BRAT THAT I KEEP CALLING OUT...
...murder someone in cold blood...?

Those men/women of law enforcement that swore an oath to serve and protect people...?
They will actually pretend that they didn’t see that shit...
Wow. That happens to be ‘How America currently works’. (← Do I really believe this? No. I KNOW this.)
        
Am I exaggerating here...? 
Or, will the police actually ignore this rich brat murdering people in cold blood...?
The answer, is that, the rich brat hires personal military contractors to kill people. 
Those PMC’s are deadly... and they don’t ask questions, they just kill people.

PMC.Guy2: Well... who cares?
PMC.Guy1: I’m just sayin’, what if the person that hired us is having us commit murder...?
PMC.Guy2: We ARE committing murder... duh.
PMC.Guy1: Nah, I meant like, covering some shit up...
PMC.Guy2: I don’t care bro. 
          I’m gettin’ paid, and that’s that.
PMC.Guy1: This is too easy though, bro... 
          Something feels wrong.
PMC.Guy2: *puts the rifle away* Look dude. 
          *points at PMC.Guy1* You’re really startin’ to piss me off.
          You and your god damn *waves absurdly* conscious...
PMC.Guy1: I didn’t sign up to fuckin’ murder some oblivious idiot that doesn’t know who he pissed off.
PMC.Guy2: *obnoxiously chewing gum for a moment, staring* Bro.
PMC.Guy1: Look at him. 
          There’s no fuckin’ way this dude could be pissing off the most powerful people in the world.
PMC.Guy2: Yeah...? 
          Then why’s he on a hit list? Hm?
PMC.Guy1: Maybe he knows how to manipulate them...
PMC.Guy2: LOL. This guy, right here...?
PMC.Guy1: Yeah. He hasn’t done anything else to deserve being killed like this.
PMC.Guy2: He obviously did somethin’ otherwise, why would I even take this mission...?

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

The reason that the rich brat kept getting away with it is because he kept:
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
| killing people | lining his pockets w/ more money | getting AWAY it | being OVERLOOKED | hiding in plain sight |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
...so, the rich brat KEPT DOING IT. Not unlike Gustavo Fring in Breaking Bad.

Just, a bunch of morons never put it together.
Then after Gus finally IS caught, Captain Merkel talks to Hank and Gomey, about making foiled pouches 
for sea bass... then Captain Merkel fucks off for not seeing something that was right under his nose that 
whole time. I never understood that, really... You would think that maybe Merkel could be arrested for not 
seeing Gustavo Fring doin’ some highly illegal/questionable shit...

But the reason SOME stuff is on TV, is because they want people to FEEL like, if you’re a bad dude...?
...*chuckles* you’re gonna get caught. Meanwhile, most murders go unsolved.

MICHAEL CHIKLIS (THING in Fantastic Four w/ Jessia Alba) and WALTON GOGGINS (the bad guy in the show JUSTIFIED)

...who somehow mistakenly call what they do “ENFORCING THE LAW”...
...rather than what they’re ACTUALLY doing, which is called “BREAKING THE LAW CONSTANTLY”

It’s a great show, and the people at the following agencies live by it as the perfect cop training material:
- New York State Trooper Barracks at the Clifton Park Public Safety Building in Clifton Park, NY
- the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office Administrative Office at 6010 County Farm Road, Ballston Spa, NY
- the New York State Trooper Academy at the Harriman State Campus, Albany, NY
- the local Federal Bureau of Investigation field office at 200 McCarty Ave, Albany NY

If you haven’t seen it...? You need to, ASAP, because then you will understand how ALL of those agencies operate.
100% of every officer that works in all of those listed locations...? They do all of the same exact shit that
they do on this show. So, not watching it will leave YOU and everyone YOU KNOW, at a total disadvantage.

Watch the show. They literally use it as training material.
This show is mad good, it’ll keep you on the edge of your seat, you’ll wonder what the hell they’ll do next,
It is fictional, but it is VERY REALISTIC. 

Because it’s basically a bunch of cops that break every law they feel like breaking, and somehow, they 
consider themselves the “good guys”. 

This is basically how a lot of cops who wind up getting involved with Narcotics units wind up acting like. 
In other words, people like Sgt. Bosco, or Trooper Messines, or even Sara DeRusso, they will do the drugs, get
addicted to the lifestyle, the money, the drugs, the people... they wind up forgetting that they’re a cop.
They’re not supposed to allow themselves to be corrupted like that. 
But- it happens every fuckin’ day.
When people like Sara DeRusso make unlawful and unconstitutional arrests...?
Then it is literally a prime example of how to indicate that she along with the others I just specified...
...they fuckin’ suck ass at their jobs when they FAIL TO COLLECT EVIDENCE.

somehow know ahead of time, to buy some fuckin’ gum, bro. Cause... the show is just a lot less INTERESTING, if
a cop is not somehow obnoxiously chewing on a real nice piece of fuckin’ gum. That’s right.

You’ll NEVER see an episode of COPS filmed in CLIFTON PARK, NY, because the show actually CHERRY PICKS the things
that are LEGAL for the COPS to DO. So, they have probably TRIED to record MANY INSTANCES of Clifton Park, NY, or
even Albany, NY...? But the police constantly break the law around here AND at these organizations...

The movie starts off with a scene where tons of cop cars are literally surrounding an elementary school, where 
Arnold Shwarzenegger shows up as Jack fuckin’ god damn Slater... Walking on the tops of a bunch of cop cars,
where all the cops are being big pussies cause Jack the Ripper has the kids up on the roof.

Jack tells the chief and the Lieutenant Governor, to ‘suck a fuckin’ dick, bro...’ he’s goin’ in...
Good Jack (Slater) faces off against Evil Jack (the Ripper), and tells him to let the kid go.
Evil Jack starts laughing maniacally, and tells him, somethin’ a fuckin crazy bastard would say...
...then Good Jack tosses a grenade at the kids feet...
...Evil Jack knows it’s not a live grenade...
...Good Jack says “Nah, it’s a live grenade alright...
...Evil Jack is like “I don’t think so, you wouldn’t do that to your own kid...
...then Evil Jack tells the kid to pick it up, and it TURNS INTO A KNIFE...
...and then Jacks kid stabs Jack the Ripper, but then Jack the Ripper falls over the ledge and drags...
...Jack Slater’s 10 year old son down the side of the building...
...and then the movie loses focus.

Anyway, mom gets fuckin’ pissed at Danny, Danny’s watchin’ Wile E. Coyote chase the fuckin’ Roadrunner...
Mom shakes her finger in Danny’s face and says “You better not fuckin’ go watchin’ movies at that old dude’s
run down movie theatre, how many times have I told you to...” but Danny drowns it all out.

Danny tries to leave the apartment, but then a sick fuck manages to hold him at knifepoint and steal all their
shit. Then the movie skips ahead to the police station, where the police are just as lazy as Trooper Borden who
just so happen to be with his girlfriend/wife and 2 kids (1 girl, 1 boy) at Clifton Park Target on 07/09/22 at 
about noon time...? Anyway, the movie cop says “You’re to go straight home...” just like Trooper Borden told me
on 06/17/20 that PEGASUS/PHANTOM does not exist since the Federal Counterterrorism Intelligence Agency said so.

Anyway, just like I tell Trooper Borden how fuckin lazy he, and Sara DeRusso are...?
Danny Maddigan decides to go back to the fuckin’ movie theater.
Nick, suddenly introduces the idea of the golden fuckin’ ticket bro. Cause. Houdini gave it to him...
Nick had a bombastic story to tell about how the golden ticket was handed to him... and now it’s his.
Then he returns to his regular voice and says “And now it’s yours.”

Danny, being fuckin’ WICKED IMPRESSED... with the WAY that Nick decided to introduce Jack Slater IV to the kid...
...Megadeth Angry Again plays as the movie starts, flying over the ocean toward the glass-eyed fuckwads mansion...
...Dude’s reading a newspaper, Jack’s cousin is sitting in a chair, being interrogated...
...glass-eyed fuckwad shoots a fuckin smiley face in the newspaper...
...it introduces the concept that he’s a fuckin straight shooter, and he’s got a British accent too, fuckface.

Arnold Shwarzenegger, holdin’ down the fort as Jack Slater... the toughest, coolest, most awesome cop that ever
lived... one who literally, hands down, makes NYS TROOPER ROBERT MESSINES and his son TROOPER/DEPUTY MESSINES 
look like the biggest pussies that have ever had a fucking badge throughout human history... Jack Slater doesn’t
NEED to cause a word editor to keep locking up and freezing... Nah. That’s because he will literally shoot a cop
like that who WOULD keep causing a word editor to freeze, lock up, or crash... in the fuckin head.

Why...? Because... Freedom of Speech and Expression isn’t actually under BRITISH RULE or anything like that.
Neither are bullets flying into the HEAD, of a PERSON who keeps doing that to my fucking word editor on the laptop 
I’m using. Do it again motherfucker. See how much longer you’ll be alive.

That’s why he’s a fictional character... Doesn’t exist... But- should.
Why...? Because sometimes MALICIOUS ABUSE OF AUTHORITY is ROBERT MESSINES being the same thing as PRACTICE...
...PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT. (Foreshadowing)

Jack Slater is literally driving around in a friggen convertible, not even looking at the fuckin’ road, shooting 
sons of bitches while driving with his knees... anytime the bad guys toss him a stick of dynamite...? Heh.
Slater just drives in the direction to ROLL the bundle of dynamite into his hands, so he can defuse the fuse. 
That’s cause he’s not a little bitch like Robert Messines, or his son.

Anyway, at some point, the old run down theatre somehow turns into a friggen portal to the movie dimension, all
because of Danny Maddigan’s magical golden ticket from Harry Houdini himself. The ticket starts to glow from the
ancient power of the late masterful magician, when suddenly...? A stick of dynamite is lobbed at Jack Slater’s   
convertible... but- it lands in the movie theatre, causing it to be quite an immediate threat to Danny.

Danny starts to freak the fuck out, because...? He sees a fuckin’ stick of dynamite getting closer and closer... 
“UH, NICK~?!? NICK~!!!” Explosion. Danny wakes up... in a daze, looking upward, seeing palm trees passing by, and
just the blue sky behind them. Danny lives in New York City, there’s no fuckin’ palm trees there, but he sure as 
hell sees some fuckin’ palm trees, and everything is dead silent. Quiet. 

Suddenly... he starts to hear the gunshots of Jack Slater, driving with his god damn knees, not even looking at 
the road... Then Danny is like “HEY, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON DUDE...~?!?”

Jack Slater loses these fuckin’ dipshits by driving into a place where a bunch of girls start freaking out...
...and then Danny realizes that ALL OF THE WOMEN ARE FUCKING HOT...
...AND THAT MEANS HE IS LITERALLY IN THE GOD DAMN MOVIE THAT HE WAS WATCHING...

So, Jack starts bickering back and forth with the kid... 
They go back to the station where Whiskers (voiced by Danny Devito) is pinching a female officers butt, and she 
says “YOU BETTER NOT DO THAT AGAIN, FURBALL~!” and it’s a very extravagant looking Los Angeles Police Department.

Pissed off black guy screams “SLAAAAAAAAATER~!” and ALL of the fuckin glass windows shatter... as the window guy
is in the middle of replacing the glass that shattered the LAST time... Pissed off black guy is speaking so god 
damn fast...? Neither Jack or Danny even understand a fuckin word he’s saying...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

...then they literally do what the police think to do like years after they arrest somebody...
...they begin to actually look at EVIDENCE and COLLECT TESTIMONY...

...the DELAY where the GUY IN CHARGE and JACK SLATER...
...actually determine how the hell Danny even made his way into Jack’s car...?

          We’ve got some real fuckfaced villains out there, and this kid is your new sidekick.
Jack    : Ohhhhh, no... 
          Not THIS kid...
Captain : Yeah. This kid, your new sidekick. Or else...
Danny   : Cool... so I’m like an official investigator now, huh...?
Captain : Oh, listen kid... We’re gonna fuckin’ find out somethin’ pretty god damn soon, and I’ve got a feeling...
          ...you’re the golden ticket that’s gonna help us find out.

Anyway, Jack tried to visit his cousin, who was killed in the introduction to Jack Slater IV.
Danny Maddigan is literally in the passenger seat, bickering back and forth with Jack Slater.
THEN, all of a sudden...? Danny sees the fuckin bad guy’s house.

Danny : The BAD GUYS...? Are in *points* THERE~!
Well, guess what...?
Jack Slater takes his badge off, and literally tries to give it to Danny. He’s like...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Jack  : Here ya go, kid...
        You earned it~!
Danny : I didn’t do ANYTHING to earn it...
Jack  : No, you don’t understand...
        You just SOLVED THE ENTIRE CASE without the YEARS of psychological interrogation techniques...
        ...or any of the training that I spent YEARS accumulating at the academy...
        ...and without a single SHRED OF PROOF, TESTIMONY, or EVIDENCE...?
        ...you just POINT YOUR FINGER...
        ...and say ‘THE BAD GUYS ARE IN THERE’!?!

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Because this is exactly how Sara DeRusso from the New York State Troopers in TROOP G, did her job on 06/28/22,
by making an UNLAWFUL AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL ARREST... literally acted JUST LIKE DANNY MADDIGAN DID, in this scene.

Jack decides to go knock on the door, and realizes that there actually is something SHADY about the dude with the
glass eye. Jack realizes “Alright, the fuck face that I just said ‘How are you going to snap your fingers, if I rip 
off both of your (fuckin’) thumbs...?’”, is suspiciously wearing a glass eye that Danny pointed out. So, it’s on.

Anyway, Jack Slater is later approached by agent Practice, basically the same thing as Robert Messines.
Basically a cop that shouldn’t be one... decides to play favorites with the mobsters, and attempts to betray Jack
until Whiskers basically saves the fuckin’ day.

They goes to a funeral where hundreds of mobsters realize he’s a fuckin cop named Jack Slater, and then they all 
whip out their machine guns, Uzis and pistols, and they just unload entire clips at this dude who’s diving through
fuckin’ gunfire on the top of this building that just so happens to have a swimming pool there... Jack is too pro 
to allow a single bullet to HIT HIM AT ALL... So, millions of bullets destroy EVERYTHING ELSE, but HE doesn’t get 
shot at all... Dude gets in an elevator, helicopter says “Hello ya fuck~!” elevator gets shot to oblivion, Jack is 
holding onto a portion of the elevator with the piano keys hitting in slow motion when the thing breaks off... then
Jack has a look of horror on his face that says “oh shit…~!” as he starts to fall to his death. 

But, guess what…?
Danny fuckin’ catches him with the crane, and saves his life… just in the nick of time, too.
With little time to spare, he has to get Louis the Fart’s dead body fall into a tar pit with him...
...and the body explodes within the tar. 
Basically ripping one of the biggest fuckin’ farts ever witnessed by mankind... 

Dives into tar with the dude who’s about to blow up... tar that he can wipe off effortlessly with a SINGLE WIPE 
from the NAPKINS that are somehow CONVENIENTLY LOCATED ADJACENT to the tar pit...

Then, they realize what the fuck is goin on NOW, dude. They decide to drive Whitney’s fuckin’ kick ass monster 
truck into the glass-eyed fuckwads mansion... They basically have this fuckface dead to rights, you’re goin to
prison NOW, ya fuckin’ clown boy~! But then...? Somehow a glass eye that just so happens to be an explosive device 
causes the glass-eyed fuckwad AND that dude’s butler... to be thrown into the real world. Uh-oh.

The glass-eyed fuckbag is NOW, thrown into the real world... now EVERYBODY’s basically fucked, dude.
Jack Slater finally realizes that Danny Maddigan was telling him the truth the whole fuckin time.
Slowly over the next act, Jack Slater realizes that many of the things he’s believed his whole entire life...?

Was a fucking lie. A fictional story... Make believe. False. Not real. Because, they decide to go into the REAL 
world... and now they’re REALLY knee deep up shits creek...

In Danny’s world, they begin to unravel the mystery as to where the glass-eyed fuckbag may actually be...?

And then, it’s fuckin’ ON bro... They see the fuckin dude in a cab with his butler... but they get out and run.
Jack says “RUBBER BABY BUGGY BUMPERS... HA. BET YOU DIDN’T KNOW I WOULD SAY THAT~!? DID YA...?”
Nah. Danny didn’t think that at all, so Jack REALLY got Danny THAT time...

Anyway, Jack and the butler get into a game of Chicken in a Ford Taurus and a Checkered cab.
Danny watches them get into a pretty severe accident... and he’s immediately SCARED and afraid that Jack just got
killed in an accident... Starts running up to the Ford Taurus... Jack gets out.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Jack  : Damnit, that really HURT~!
Danny : You could’ve been killed you big idiot~!
Jack  : HEY... 
        Ford Taurus, airbag. 
        Checkered cab...? 
        No airbag. 
        Who’s dumb...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Some time passes, then suddenly, the glass-eyed fuckbag causes Jack the Ripper to come back from the movie world.
Jack the Ripper tries to kill the REAL Arnold Shwarzenegger at the premiere of Jack Slater IV who’s in the balcony.
Jack Slater saves his life by trying to get this fuckin douchebag Jack the Ripper... and when people try to arrest 
Jack, they realize it’s Arnold fuckin’ Shwarzegger HIMSELF, and they’re like ‘OH WE’RE SO TERRIBLY SORRY, WE 
THOUGHT YOU WERE A LUNATIC FOR SOME REASON’, but then he’s like “NAH, NOT A LUNATIC, THAT OTHER GUY IS, GOTTA GO.”

Then, they face off on the fuckin balcony of the building, cause Jack kicks the fuckin door down, and knows that
the introduction of the movie, Jack Slater IV is about to unfold yet again, only THIS TIME, Danny’d be the hostage.
Just (2) dudes named Jack, facing off, yet again... standing toe-to-toe, face-to-face... 
...the embodiment of good versus evil...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Slater : Let him go, ya fuckin’ pencil necked fuckface...
Ripper : Hey Jack, here we ARE again, just like old times... huh...?
Slater : Dude I will fuckin’ kick the shit out of you just like I always do... So...
Ripper : OH YEH DUDE...?
         How you gonna do that, Jack...?
         Hm...?
         *shakes head* I’ve got the fuckin’ kid right here dude...
         Nothin’ you can even DO about it, ha ha ha ha ha. (← lame bastard thinks he’s so fuckin funny, huh?)

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Suddenly, the scene unfolds, Arnold falls to the ground and nearly gets sliced by Jack the Rippers fuckin’ axe...
...grabs his gun, and shoots this ice hearted fuckbag down... and he drags Danny along with him...
...EXCEPT...
...THIS TIME...?
...Danny manages to SURVIVE, and is holding onto a fuckin’ pipe.
With only seconds to spare...? Jack’s gotta climb down and practically save the kids life, AGAIN...
...but he’s not at full Jack Slater MOVIE strength at all... nah. 
He’s at basically a quarter or less of real-world strength... but he knows he’s gotta do SOMETHING, otherwise...
...Danny’s gonna fall to his demise.

While the rain is pounding down hard, and the pipe is the only thing he can hold onto, he manages to pull Danny
upward, swinging him back up to the top of the building, and then pulling himself back up to safety... barely.
Basically, Jack Slater finally realizes what it’s like to be exhausted... but then SUDDENLY...

Glass-eyed fuckbag shows up. Has the fuckin’ gun... and an umbrella.
He manages to shoot Jack Slater, whereby causing a life threatening injury where he’s actually hurt very badly...
but then Danny Maddigan collects the gun and shoots the glass-eyed fuckbag dead, and he explodes, basically.

Jack Slater, now fucked up in the real world...?
He has to get an AMBULANCE to stop... the ambulance is on the way to the nearest hospital, and the music strums a
harrowing tune, the abysmal demise of Jack fuckin’ Slater... the EMT’s are looking at each other, they realize 
there is not much they can even DO... Then Danny says, STOP. But they fuckin ignore him. So, he has to whip out 
the GUN, and THEN they fuckin stop and run the fuck out of the ambulance... At or about this time, Death comes in
from the movie Hamlet I believe... basically the same exact actor that plays Jack the Ripper...? But, this time...

It’s the living embodiment of Death, himself.
Danny gets to the movie theatre, and tries to bring him back into the scene that has been STUCK with the monster 
truck playing on the projector for the entire time that they’ve been back in the real world... unreal, basically.

Suddenly, Death shows up, and Danny sees him. Danny gets pissed off... 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Danny : STAY BACK.
        I’m sick and tired of you getting to decide, who stays and who goes...?
        Well I’m telling you, THIS ONE STAYS~!
Death : I was only curious...
        He’s not on any of my lists...
        ...though YOU are...
        ...Daniel.
Danny : *long pause, intense glare, still aiming the gun at Death, himself*
Death : You die, grandfather.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Danny manages to get Jack Slater back into the movie world Danny sees Whiskers, and tells him Jack’s been shot. 
So, Whiskers goes and gets a doctor. Jack thinks he’s dying, tries to tell Danny that he had a good run while he

did... and he’s basically ready to die. Then, the doctor shows up, starts to treat Jack...?
Then, the doctor says “Kid, what the fuck dude, I wouldn’t even call this a flesh wound...”

Jack’s fine now. They’re all going back to the way the world was supposed to be... the kid steps backward until
he realizes he’s back in the real world... Now he’s just in the audience again, watching the finally scene of the 
movie playing out... 

The captain is just reaming Jack out for almost being killed, and causing untold amounts of chaos, damage, and etc.
Smoke still blowing out of his ears... and then Jack says “SHUT THE HELL UP~!”
The captain is fuckin’ speechless cause... he doesn’t even realize that Jack is now literally making statements
about how the captain is the COMIC RELIEF, and JACK IS THE FUCKIN’ HERO, so SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY... 
...the captain realizes he’s as useless as MICHAEL ZURLO at SCSO, as well as SGT BOSCO and TROOPER MESSINES.
They really have no ammunition or anything to respond to being told to SHUT THE FUCK UP, YOU SUCK AT YOUR JOB,
and then that’s exactly what they do.

At which point, Jack drives off into the sunset, thinking of his buddy Danny Maddigan who helped him come to 
terms with the death of his son in the beginning of Jack Slater IV. Then, Aerosmith plays during the outro.

It is by far, not very realistic of a movie, nor about how cops operate. However, there is an interesting thing
about the SYMBOLIC NATURE of this movie. It’s called INTEGRITY. And, ALL of the AGENCIES and PEOPLE I’ve specified,
have nothing but a VERY SMALL FRACTION or PERCENTAGE of the INTEGRITY, that a FICTIONAL MOVIE COP NAMED JACK SLATER
fuckin’ had in this movie.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The movie starts off with a scene where tons of cop cars are literally surrounding an elementary school, where 
Arnold Shwarzenegger shows up as Jack fuckin’ god damn Slater... Walking on the tops of a bunch of cop cars,
where all the cops are being big pussies cause Jack the Ripper has the kids up on the roof.

Jack tells the chief and the Lieutenant Governor, to ‘suck a fuckin’ dick, bro...’ he’s goin’ in...
Good Jack (Slater) faces off against Evil Jack (the Ripper), and tells him to let the kid go.
Evil Jack starts laughing maniacally, and tells him, somethin’ a fuckin crazy bastard would say...
...then Good Jack tosses a grenade at the kids feet...
...Evil Jack knows it’s not a live grenade...
...Good Jack says “Nah, it’s a live grenade alright...
...Evil Jack is like “I don’t think so, you wouldn’t do that to your own kid...
...then Evil Jack tells the kid to pick it up, and it TURNS INTO A KNIFE...
...and then Jacks kid stabs Jack the Ripper, but then Jack the Ripper falls over the ledge and drags...
...Jack Slater’s 10 year old son down the side of the building...
...and then the movie loses focus.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Danny : FOCUS~!
        NICK~! The movie lost focus, dude... Wtf.
Nick  : Dude... Sorry, I passed out, I’m getting’ old and shit dude...
Danny : Well, that’s what they ALL say, dude...
Nick  : Look kid, you come back later, cause you’re late for school or some shit, aren’t ya...?
Danny : Damnit... I am.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Anyway, mom gets fuckin’ pissed at Danny, Danny’s watchin’ Wile E. Coyote chase the fuckin’ Roadrunner...
Mom shakes her finger in Danny’s face and says “You better not fuckin’ go watchin’ movies at that old dude’s
run down movie theatre, how many times have I told you to...” but Danny drowns it all out.

Danny tries to leave the apartment, but then a sick fuck manages to hold him at knifepoint and steal all their
shit. Then the movie skips ahead to the police station, where the police are just as lazy as Trooper Borden who
just so happen to be with his girlfriend/wife and 2 kids (1 girl, 1 boy) at Clifton Park Target on 07/09/22 at 
about noon time...? Anyway, the movie cop says “You’re to go straight home...” just like Trooper Borden told me
on 06/17/20 that PEGASUS/PHANTOM does not exist since the Federal Counterterrorism Intelligence Agency said so.

Anyway, just like I tell Trooper Borden how fuckin lazy he, and Sara DeRusso are...?
Danny Maddigan decides to go back to the fuckin’ movie theater.
Nick, suddenly introduces the idea of the golden fuckin’ ticket bro. Cause. Houdini gave it to him...
Nick had a bombastic story to tell about how the golden ticket was handed to him... and now it’s his.
Then he returns to his regular voice and says “And now it’s yours.”

Danny, being fuckin’ WICKED IMPRESSED... with the WAY that Nick decided to introduce Jack Slater IV to the kid...
...Megadeth Angry Again plays as the movie starts, flying over the ocean toward the glass-eyed fuckwads mansion...
...Dude’s reading a newspaper, Jack’s cousin is sitting in a chair, being interrogated...
...glass-eyed fuckwad shoots a fuckin smiley face in the newspaper...
...it introduces the concept that he’s a fuckin straight shooter, and he’s got a British accent too, fuckface.

Arnold Shwarzenegger, holdin’ down the fort as Jack Slater... the toughest, coolest, most awesome cop that ever
lived... one who literally, hands down, makes NYS TROOPER ROBERT MESSINES and his son TROOPER/DEPUTY MESSINES 
look like the biggest pussies that have ever had a fucking badge throughout human history... Jack Slater doesn’t
NEED to cause a word editor to keep locking up and freezing... Nah. That’s because he will literally shoot a cop
like that who WOULD keep causing a word editor to freeze, lock up, or crash... in the fuckin head.

Why...? Because... Freedom of Speech and Expression isn’t actually under BRITISH RULE or anything like that.
Neither are bullets flying into the HEAD, of a PERSON who keeps doing that to my fucking word editor on the laptop 
I’m using. Do it again motherfucker. See how much longer you’ll be alive.

That’s why he’s a fictional character... Doesn’t exist... But- should.
Why...? Because sometimes MALICIOUS ABUSE OF AUTHORITY is ROBERT MESSINES being the same thing as PRACTICE...
...PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT. (Foreshadowing)

Jack Slater is literally driving around in a friggen convertible, not even looking at the fuckin’ road, shooting 
sons of bitches while driving with his knees... anytime the bad guys toss him a stick of dynamite...? Heh.
Slater just drives in the direction to ROLL the bundle of dynamite into his hands, so he can defuse the fuse. 
That’s cause he’s not a little bitch like Robert Messines, or his son.

Anyway, at some point, the old run down theatre somehow turns into a friggen portal to the movie dimension, all
because of Danny Maddigan’s magical golden ticket from Harry Houdini himself. The ticket starts to glow from the
ancient power of the late masterful magician, when suddenly...? A stick of dynamite is lobbed at Jack Slater’s   
convertible... but- it lands in the movie theatre, causing it to be quite an immediate threat to Danny.

Danny starts to freak the fuck out, because...? He sees a fuckin’ stick of dynamite getting closer and closer... 
“UH, NICK~?!? NICK~!!!” Explosion. Danny wakes up... in a daze, looking upward, seeing palm trees passing by, and
just the blue sky behind them. Danny lives in New York City, there’s no fuckin’ palm trees there, but he sure as 
hell sees some fuckin’ palm trees, and everything is dead silent. Quiet. 

Suddenly... he starts to hear the gunshots of Jack Slater, driving with his god damn knees, not even looking at 
the road... Then Danny is like “HEY, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON DUDE...~?!?”

Jack Slater loses these fuckin’ dipshits by driving into a place where a bunch of girls start freaking out...
...and then Danny realizes that ALL OF THE WOMEN ARE FUCKING HOT...
...AND THAT MEANS HE IS LITERALLY IN THE GOD DAMN MOVIE THAT HE WAS WATCHING...

So, Jack starts bickering back and forth with the kid... 
They go back to the station where Whiskers (voiced by Danny Devito) is pinching a female officers butt, and she 
says “YOU BETTER NOT DO THAT AGAIN, FURBALL~!” and it’s a very extravagant looking Los Angeles Police Department.

Pissed off black guy screams “SLAAAAAAAAATER~!” and ALL of the fuckin glass windows shatter... as the window guy
is in the middle of replacing the glass that shattered the LAST time... Pissed off black guy is speaking so god 
damn fast...? Neither Jack or Danny even understand a fuckin word he’s saying...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Danny   : Do you even know what the hell he’s saying...?
Jack    : Nah.
          I never know what the fuck this dude is saying...
Captain : Well see if this is clear enough...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

...then they literally do what the police think to do like years after they arrest somebody...
...they begin to actually look at EVIDENCE and COLLECT TESTIMONY...

...the DELAY where the GUY IN CHARGE and JACK SLATER...
...actually determine how the hell Danny even made his way into Jack’s car...?
...that’s actually EXTREMELY ACCURATE. (← VERY REALISTIC DELAY, THATS LITERALLY HOW LONG THE POLICE TAKE SOMETIMES)

Danny WAS telling them the truth...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Captain : No such number, no such name... the State of New York has never HEARD of you, Mr. Maddigan.
          Who are you REALLY working for...?
Danny   :     *realizes he has to START LYING TO PEOPLE in order for them to BELIEVE what he’s saying*
          Look, I’m just some kid, he drove his car and I almost got shot, and fell into his car, and he saved
          my life~!
Captain and Jack: *relaxed*
Captain : FINALLY, it sounds like he’s tellin’ us the TRUTH, now...
Jack    : Doesn’t explain everything...
Captain : Yeah...?
          Well, he’s your new sidekick.
Jack    : WHAT...?
Captain : OH, you heard me...

Slater : Let him go, ya fuckin’ pencil necked fuckface...
Ripper : Hey Jack, here we ARE again, just like old times... huh...?
Slater : Dude I will fuckin’ kick the shit out of you just like I always do... So...
Ripper : OH YEH DUDE...?
         How you gonna do that, Jack...?
         Hm...?
         *shakes head* I’ve got the fuckin’ kid right here dude...
         Nothin’ you can even DO about it, ha ha ha ha ha. (← lame bastard thinks he’s so fuckin funny, huh?)

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Suddenly, the scene unfolds, Arnold falls to the ground and nearly gets sliced by Jack the Rippers fuckin’ axe...
...grabs his gun, and shoots this ice hearted fuckbag down... and he drags Danny along with him...
...EXCEPT...
...THIS TIME...?
...Danny manages to SURVIVE, and is holding onto a fuckin’ pipe.
With only seconds to spare...? Jack’s gotta climb down and practically save the kids life, AGAIN...
...but he’s not at full Jack Slater MOVIE strength at all... nah. 
He’s at basically a quarter or less of real-world strength... but he knows he’s gotta do SOMETHING, otherwise...
...Danny’s gonna fall to his demise.

While the rain is pounding down hard, and the pipe is the only thing he can hold onto, he manages to pull Danny
upward, swinging him back up to the top of the building, and then pulling himself back up to safety... barely.
Basically, Jack Slater finally realizes what it’s like to be exhausted... but then SUDDENLY...

Glass-eyed fuckbag shows up. Has the fuckin’ gun... and an umbrella.
He manages to shoot Jack Slater, whereby causing a life threatening injury where he’s actually hurt very badly...
but then Danny Maddigan collects the gun and shoots the glass-eyed fuckbag dead, and he explodes, basically.

Jack Slater, now fucked up in the real world...?
He has to get an AMBULANCE to stop... the ambulance is on the way to the nearest hospital, and the music strums a
harrowing tune, the abysmal demise of Jack fuckin’ Slater... the EMT’s are looking at each other, they realize 
there is not much they can even DO... Then Danny says, STOP. But they fuckin ignore him. So, he has to whip out 
the GUN, and THEN they fuckin stop and run the fuck out of the ambulance... At or about this time, Death comes in
from the movie Hamlet I believe... basically the same exact actor that plays Jack the Ripper...? But, this time...

It’s the living embodiment of Death, himself.
Danny gets to the movie theatre, and tries to bring him back into the scene that has been STUCK with the monster 
truck playing on the projector for the entire time that they’ve been back in the real world... unreal, basically.

Suddenly, Death shows up, and Danny sees him. Danny gets pissed off... 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Danny : STAY BACK.
        I’m sick and tired of you getting to decide, who stays and who goes...?
        Well I’m telling you, THIS ONE STAYS~!
Death : I was only curious...
        He’s not on any of my lists...
        ...though YOU are...
        ...Daniel.
Danny : *long pause, intense glare, still aiming the gun at Death, himself*
Death : You die, grandfather.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Danny manages to get Jack Slater back into the movie world Danny sees Whiskers, and tells him Jack’s been shot. 
So, Whiskers goes and gets a doctor. Jack thinks he’s dying, tries to tell Danny that he had a good run while he

did... and he’s basically ready to die. Then, the doctor shows up, starts to treat Jack...?
Then, the doctor says “Kid, what the fuck dude, I wouldn’t even call this a flesh wound...”

Jack’s fine now. They’re all going back to the way the world was supposed to be... the kid steps backward until
he realizes he’s back in the real world... Now he’s just in the audience again, watching the finally scene of the 
movie playing out... 

The captain is just reaming Jack out for almost being killed, and causing untold amounts of chaos, damage, and etc.
Smoke still blowing out of his ears... and then Jack says “SHUT THE HELL UP~!”
The captain is fuckin’ speechless cause... he doesn’t even realize that Jack is now literally making statements
about how the captain is the COMIC RELIEF, and JACK IS THE FUCKIN’ HERO, so SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY... 
...the captain realizes he’s as useless as MICHAEL ZURLO at SCSO, as well as SGT BOSCO and TROOPER MESSINES.
They really have no ammunition or anything to respond to being told to SHUT THE FUCK UP, YOU SUCK AT YOUR JOB,
and then that’s exactly what they do.

At which point, Jack drives off into the sunset, thinking of his buddy Danny Maddigan who helped him come to 
terms with the death of his son in the beginning of Jack Slater IV. Then, Aerosmith plays during the outro.

It is by far, not very realistic of a movie, nor about how cops operate. However, there is an interesting thing
about the SYMBOLIC NATURE of this movie. It’s called INTEGRITY. And, ALL of the AGENCIES and PEOPLE I’ve specified,
have nothing but a VERY SMALL FRACTION or PERCENTAGE of the INTEGRITY, that a FICTIONAL MOVIE COP NAMED JACK SLATER
fuckin’ had in this movie.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Comparisons (2)",@"
If the rich brat kills people, the police shrug their fuckin’ shoulders: "What can anybody do about it? Jesus.”
If it’s somebody that ISN’T a rich brat at all, and gets caught...? That person will go to prison. 
Hm. Let’s draw up a comparison here.

Yeah I’m certain that cops don’t just allow some kid to kill whoever, unless they’re paid off. That’s the point.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Control Program/Monitor",@"
A man named Gary Kildall (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Kildall) was the sole inspiration that caused 
Microsoft to develop an operating system called Disk Operating System. I really don’t exactly have the whole 
entire story, maybe I have something wrong.

William Gates and Paul Allen wrote a version of BASIC for the Altair 8800 called Altair BASIC.
In the book that Mr. Gates wrote called “The Road Ahead”, he explains how and why CP/M actually cost a fair
amount more than Disk Operating System, and THAT is the reason why his deal with IBM went as well as it did.

There was a 3rd entry or option, something that the military made, which was about `$475 for a license to that 
operating system. Then, Kildall’s CP/M from Digital Research was about `$125-175 I believe...?

Then, there was Disk Operating System which was like `$50 bucks or something like that.
Now, this is way back in an area where I wasn’t even alive... but I believe that Gates and Kildall had some 
sort of friendship prior to the IBM deal, and then AFTER the fiasco went down, Kildall basically lost everything 
piece by piece.

There’s definitely a lesson to learn from this happening, though, this guy Gary Kildall basically had the idea 
for a smartphone long before Steve Jobs developed it.

(Gary Kildall/Digital Research) had inspired a lot of people in the 80’s, and was seen on a number of interviews. 
He even came up with the CONCEPT for the MODERN SMARTPHONE, long before STEVE JOBS BUILT IT…

To say that Gary Kildall was NOT a very large influential character in the 80’s, is sorta like saying that 
Donald Trump was one of the best presidents that ever lived…
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Microsoft - Larger than Life",@"
Computers were PRETTY FUCKIN SLOW back then, and a lot of times people had to swap in a number of floppy disks
to load up programs or really to do whatever with the computer.

Disk Operating System was actually quite revolutionary, but it was extremely similar to CP/M.
86-DOS used to be called Q-DOS for Quick and Dirty Operating System. It was renamed to 86-DOS because of the CPU.
Then eventually Microsoft acquired it somehow, and then they renamed it to MS-DOS. DOS was a huge hit back in the 
day, and it led to the development of Microsoft Windows. Windows Version 1 was NOT exactly without it’s challenges.

There are plenty of videos that show Windows in it’s very early form, and it wouldn’t be until Windows 3.0 where 
they were making graphical user interfaces that had a full 256-color palette, or maybe it was 65536-colors. Not 
certain whether Apple had the Macintosh GUI released to market FIRST, before Windows was actually widely adopted.

What I do know is that Windows 95 was the first operating system that I used when I got my first computer.
Windows 9x operating systems ALL relied on this component called “MS-DOS”, and MS-DOS began as Q-DOS, which
drew inspiration from CP/M.

Gates talks a fair amount about his early business dealings in this book, and makes a fair number of rather 
unnervingly accurate predictions about the future, such as fiber optic internet all over the place, the internet, 
being able to shop from home, cool stuff like that. Not unnerving in a BAD way, just, surreal that this dude
has always been able to peer into the future and consistently impress the fuck out of people.

Yeah, the COMDEX 1994 presentation was pretty cool. [Cop presentation, FAKE Art sold, Bill interacts with cops]
I have respect for William Gates, as it is obvious that he has done so many great things for the world. 
But- it doesn’t change the fact that I remain absolutely convinced that he stole Gary Kildall’s intellectual 
property CP/M in order to conduct his deal with IBM, and gave Gary `$20,000 afterward.
                                                                                                                        
Here is why Mr. Gates FAILING to admit that, leaves a stain on his legacy...

$Book.AddSection(8,"Intellectual Property Theft",@"
Intellectual property theft is a SERIOUS PROBLEM now. (← It’s so serious, I had to write this entire book)
I’m not going to say that I’m gonna stay upset with the guy for doin’ that, cause obviously Kildall was seemingly
careless with his IP. However, translate that problem to today. Now it’s impossible to come up with ideas without
someone watching that can just take it from you and give you nothing for it.

IP theft is a problem that the police, nor anybody else, seem to give 2 shits about... (Maybe they do, IDK)
As far as I can tell, the police might care if someone such as myself, gets themselves stabbed ALMOST to death,
by someone who’s really respected in the community, and has a lot of money... Because they may actually be able
to call 911 on me and say that I got their knife all bloody... Now I’m REAL fucked... cause, that’s gotta be 
at least 5-10 years in prison for getting that dude’s knife bloody. It’s supposed to sound ridiculous...

For me to suggest that the cops would actually try to arrest me for being stabbed and bleeding on a knife...?
It’s a perfect metaphor for some people committing IP theft and then treating other people like a product, not 
a person. 

Here’s the thing. If someone is stabbed, and bleeding all over the place, the cops are supposed to charge the 
person HOLDING THE BLOODY KNIFE with a CRIME, for like, STABBING SOMEONE THATS PROBABLY BLEEDING TO DEATH... 
maybe they just so happen not be bleeding that badly... maybe it’s just a flesh wound like in Last Action Hero.

Normally, people should expect that the police will arrest that person, or take pictures or evidence...?
But shockingly, if it comes down to INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY or like for instance, the content of this BOOK...?
Well, they’re gonna tell me to fuck off, they have U-turns to go sit at where they’ll be doing the world a 
service. I can’t treat all of them like that... but they seem to think they’re smarter than I am.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Cool Factor",@"
Here’s the REAL problem.

If certain people LIKE you, then you’re allowed to be cool to SOME degree. But, if a lot of people don’t really 
like ya...? Then you’re only allowed a maximum COOL factor of like, nearly 0.
Might have a colossal dick that makes *every* girls mouth water when they see it...
Might even be more intelligent or more attractive, but the moment that you even THINK about trying to make 
friends with people...? Oh. You’re THAT guy that isn’t actually allowed to have a COOL factor higher than 
almost 0. “Fuck you dude. Your cool factor can’t be raised.”

This is exactly how Nikola Tesla lived and died, actually.
I hate to break it to people, but people in real life actually think like that.

The thing is, people with TALENT, SKILL, and INTELLECT, they’re just naturally a lot cooler.
They don’t need to be “ASSIGNED” a maximum cool factor by a bunch of mamby-pamby, circle-jerkin’ fuckstains.
Nah, they know that the “cool kids” are gonna pretend like they know how to come up with their own ideas.
Everyone knows that the cool kids aren’t smart enough to come up with their own original ideas. 
That’s why people will say “I’d like to SEE you try~!” (← It’s cause they want to learn something cool) 

Most people probably don’t even realize that Nikola Tesla had children. Ah... man. Nikola Tesla had kids, eh...?
Yep, sure as hell did. Nikola Tesla actually fucked some broads in his day.
People think he was a recluse, because hey- guys like Thomas Edison talked a lot of shit.

IF THESE KIDS OF HIS COULD BE FOUND... They could LITERALLY take back their father’s work, FORCIBLY.
As in, relinquish the FCC’s ownership over Nikola Tesla’s property.
Which, probably sounds pretty fuckin’ terrifying to a bunch of people like Thomas Edison... 

Otherwise, HE could’ve been the one to build WIRELESS RADIO, or like ALTERNATING CURRENT.
Simply put, Thomas Edison was quite the idea thief himself, taking ideas from other people, with no regard.
That’s because people like Thomas Edison will go on in the history books, being this awesome guy that 
SUPPOSEDLY invented the light bulb, right...? BUT- shockingly, nah. Some other dude did that like (2) full 
weeks before his ass did. 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Edison  : HEY LOOK AT THIS ITS MY INVENTION I CALL IT THE LIGHT BULB.
Person1 : Someone else already made that, ya fuck...~!
Edison  : Not one that works.
Person1 : Nah, yeh, this dude’s contraption definitely works.
          Seen it with my own eyes.
Edison  : Oh yeah, so this guy figured out the problem with filaments...?
Person1 : Yeah man, it’s a LOT brighter than yours is, too.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Edison didn’t realize this, but he was good at taking inspiration from someone else’s already complete idea...
So many people in modern society have that same take-someone-else’s-idea-while-you-still-can philosophy.
Because, if you wait too long...? Ah man, somebody else will steal that idea FIRST. Now you’re REAL fucked, dude.

Cause, before you know it...? The idea you could’ve stolen FIRST...? Well, someone else capitalized on it, and 
now you’re just a fuckin’ chump, sittin’ around, thinking “Man oh man, if I had just stolen that idea like 5 
minutes sooner...? I could be a REAL rich bastard, let me tell ya.” 

Jesse Pickett and Thomas Edison had quite a lot in common, didn’t they...?
The thing is, I can’t actually prove that Jesse did a god damn thing, cause, maybe it’s just a coincidence that 
they went to school together when cars were actively getting vandalized. That’s “sort of” the reason why I put 
that particular document right in plain view, within those pictures...

Just so we’re adamantly clear here, I have EVERY REASON TO SUSPECT THAT NFRASTRUCTURE 1) COULD, 2) WOULD, and 
3) HAS already stolen intellectual property from ME, as well as my FATHER, in the past.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y05kPm-CjVIALi6r8CNPMlIRnXvMtPpD

I gotta be careful about putting a CRITICAL PIECE OF EVIDENCE right there in the open like that, right...?
At any given moment, somebody could really just, come along and steal that evidence. Then I’d be SUPER fucked.
And then, I might even be read my Miranda rights, cuffed and brought to the station, get my prints taken, all 
for putting a piece of EVIDENCE, right out in the open for other people to see...

In fact I know that Mr. Pickett had something to do with CVE-2019-8936 at 1602 Route 9, Clifton Park, NY 12065.
So did my cousin Ryan Ward. So did the (2) dudes in the pictures I took. So did a lot of other people. At the 
end of the day...? Nfrastructure was my first suspicion, considering the recording I made a few days before. 
Files I would send from HOME to my client in SELKIRK were being ALTERED IN TRANSIT. Weirdest fuckin’ thing, 
cause he’s got Verizon FIOS. I didn’t think someone would ACTUALLY listen to an AUDIO recording I made, but 
never GAVE to anybody... I don’t remember exactly what I said in that recording, for all intents and purposes,
I know I had a reason to be pissed off, but still. I didn’t give the recording to anybody for a reason. What if
that’s how they can get ya now...? “OooOOOOooOhhhhH THIS DUDE, recorded some shit and never gave it to anybody~!” 

You don’t even have to upload an audio recording anymore... You record stuff on a phone, well, now Apple and Sprint 
own that audio recording I made and deleted. Now they have it permanently. Not me though... THAT MEANS that someone
heard all the recordings I kept making trying to talk to my ex-girlfriend, or develop my rhetoric. COOL. That’s 
sorta gay though cause that’s a total violation of privacy. 

Somebody was playing a little game with people’s lives and then taking the game a little too far, actually. 

Nikola Tesla spent his entire life being a LOT more talented than anyone who’s ever worked for General Electric 
in history. Basically, that includes: Thomas Edison. 

Otherwise, you can be smarter than every other living person, and it won’t make a single bit of difference.
That’s alarming because, I think there might be an issue in the distant future where humanity has essentially 
BRED OUT things like:
             ____________________________________________________________________________
             | intelligence | creativity | original ideas | efficiency | etc./so forth  |
             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Then the future of the human race is essentially fucked for good. You can’t expect humanity to build anything 
new or cool if they’re all good looking and constantly having sex all the time. You could have sex half the
time, that’s ok. As long as you’re not fucking 100% of the day, and you’re doin’ something productive and solving
problems...? Then, the future of the human race may be just fine.

Look. As far as I can tell, if somebody is actually mad cool...? The police don’t actually arrest those people.
Way too cool for something like handcuffs...

Dude literally has an ENTIRE TEAM of Oceans 11 grade motherfuckers, top notch NAVY Seal-Rainbow 6 crossover hit 
squad... the elite of the elite. Just a team of guys all over the place that allow him to commit fraud any time 
he wants, and then pin the fraud on someone totally different. That dude’s WAY cool. Practically raised himself, 
had a hard life walking back and forth to school, uphill both ways, 6 feet of snow... Can’t actually get in 
trouble because of how cool he is. Same with Dan Pickett, wakes up every day, sees himself in the mirror and 
starts talking to himself...

       *shaking head* Ya awesome son of a bitch.
       Jesus Christ, bub.
       You’re the real fuckin’ deal, alright.
       Only YOU... can practically eviscerate opponents with the raising of a single eyebrow...
       Who else can do that...?
       *glances around* Anybody...?
       *looks back into the mirror* Nah, didn’t think so.
       Even James Comey couldn’t pull that off... nuh-uh. 
       Nooooo way.
       This is, unfuckin’believable man.
       Too fuckin’ cool.

I have no doubt that Dan Pickett, is mad cool when he’s not ya know, spying on people. Like, former employees.
Ones that lived right around the corner from him... MAYBE it’s actually ILLEGAL for me to say: 
“Dan Pickett spies on people”, or even “Dan Pickett used to live around the corner from me”...
Trooper Borden will show up with his cuffs in hand, 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

         on social media or somethin’... 
         didn’t ya...?
Me     : Me...? 
         Buddy... you got the wrong guy.
Borden : Nah bro, I don’t, I’m lookin’ right at the post.
         You said “Dan Pickett spies on people and used to live around the corner from me.”
Me     : Yeah I mean, that’s totally legal.
Borden : Nah, man, in THIS instance...? 
         It’s TOTALLY illegal for YOU to say anything that even RESEMBLES a comment like that...
Me     : ...what?
Borden : Oh, you heard me dude, I gotta take you into the station...
         Shouldn’t be sayin’ stuff like that dude, even if it IS true...
Me     : Well, what the fuck man...? 
Borden : Look dude, that man just raised one eyebrow, and I already knew what he was tellin’ me to do.
         Now I’m here... 
         Gotta take ya in, man.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Dude lifted one eyebrow, and my life has been totally ruined ever since. 
Gonna get charged with a felony “legally saying stuff”... and then what am I gonna do, pacing around the jail,
wondering how I could’ve said something slightly different, and it would’ve played out so very differently.
Well, fuck. I … said words that offended somebody somewhere... and if I even THINK about sayin’ em anywhere
ever again...? Well... I’m probably gonna get in EVEN MORE TROUBLE.

It’s ok if Pavel Zaichenko occasionally cobs on Cuomo’s knob here and there... he won’t be offended by that.
It’s ok if Dwayne steals hard drives from customer’s computers, and then lies to customers to generate profit
for a business I used to manage more effectively than he ever did...
It’s quite alright if Jesse Pickett is the person who stole my father’s Commodore 64 disks from his car, because,
who cares man...? Even though I probably am 100% correct about all of these things...? Oh well. No big deal.
So, someone goes and builds a company like Nfrastructure off of my father’s stolen work... Oh man, is that the
real reason why I’ve been being watched...? 

Well, it was a plausible theory even BEFORE I found the card in the box. 
Dwayne Coonradt, mad cool. Never spent a single day of his life, NOT being the coolest kid around.
Doesn’t matter if I could outperform this dude every day of the week... He’s TOO COOL to be stopped.
Same thing with Dan... and John. I, probably could not actually rub a magic lantern, and wish to be as cool
as these fuckin’ guys, are... and the genie is gonna tell me there’s no fuckin’ way in hell he can pull that
off... bummer. Not even a magic genie could help me outta this.

The way I see it is, if these guys tell everybody that I’m not even allowed to have a cool factor ABOVE 0.01?
Then everybody will join in, and start tellin’ me: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Someone : Listen here, ya fuck...~! 
          *points at Dan* That dude said you’re not even allowed to LOOK at us...?
          Or even TALK to us, or even SAY ‘hello’... 
          So, *shakin’ head* I don’t know what the hell you think you’re doin’ buddy...?
          But, you need to knock it off, bub...
Me      : Look buddy, my cool factor is too high to even be written correctly.
Someone : *scoffs* Yeah...? 
          Says you, bro.
Me      : I mean, I can prove it...
Someone : Oh yeah...? 
          How?
Me      : Dude, nobody can even contain how COOL I am.
Someone : *crosses arms, looks around* This dude just told me some shit that sounds pretty interesting...
Else    : Who, that fuckin’ guy who’s not allowed to be cool...?
Someone : Yeah. 
Else    : How could a guy who isn’t even ALLOWED to be cool, say somethin’ interesting...?
          Doesn’t make any sense...
Someone : I don’t know man, but, I’m lookin’ right at em.
          Go ahead cool guy, what’s your secret formula...?
Me      : *chuckles* I’m not tellin’ you the secret formula bro. 
          What do you think I am...?
Someone : I mean, you said your COOLNESS couldn’t even be written correctly...
Me      : *nods* That’s right. 
Else    : Is that not-allowed-to-be-even-remotely-cool-dude still runnin’ his mouth...?
Someone : Oooooooohhhh yeah he is. 
          Son of a bitch thinks he’s cool as fuck... 
          We’ll just see how COOL he is, when ACTUAL COOL PEOPLE start asking him questions and shit.
Me      : Oh, no~! 
          Actual cool people...? 
          Asking ME questions...? 
          Bro, I might actually be WAY too cool for that...
Someone : Yeah right, dude. 
          That’s impossible.
Else    : What’s impossible...?
Someone : Dude just said he’s TOO COOL to be asked questions, by ACTUAL COOL PEOPLE...
          I don’t know what the hell this dude is pullin’ right now...? 
          But, I feel compelled to find out just what the hell he’s talkin’ about.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Even Dwayne knows he can’t be as cool as me... so he lies to people about it. 
Not only me being cooler, but that I happen to be quite an intelligent bastard... and that I went on a solo 
mission. Dwayne knew from the look in my eyes after I left Computer Answers...? 

I was about to throw down the proverbial gauntlet, and just, kick the ever livin’ shit out of identity theft, 
and cybercrime. Like no single person had ever done in history...

Dwayne was afraid of how intense somethin’ like that sounded... he had to run to the bathroom real quick, give
himself a quick wipe, cause he almost shit his pants.

Look, the reality is it’s irrelevant how cool anybody is... if I get stabbed to death by some kid who 
works for the police...? I’m gonna catch some charges for bleeding on this dude’s knife. 
So it’s OK if people try to kill me, and use Pegasus, and when I RECORD EVIDENCE of them ATTEMPTING TO 
MURDER ME... Oh. The evidence is gone... cause they were preventing me from getting the god damn video off, and then 
they straight up locked me out of it. It wasn’t very inconspicuous either, it was very blatant.

They were doing this shit like, *checks watch* 3 years ago or slightly more.
The way I see it, this country has either skull-fucked everybody in it...
...or nobody in America was ever free to begin with.
Ya know, it was a question I asked myself over and over... “What if, everyone always lies, all the time...?”
For instance, if the police tell you that you have rights...? Nah, you don’t.
Maybe Britain came back and fucked everybody up in America, and then they didn’t bother to tell anybody.
Now that I know that’s what’s goin’ on, I can just tell everybody how to take back control.

So basically the only alternative is to keep writing this book, I guess. Cause even if I was the best 
programmer in the world, or EVEN IF I had the literal spiritual man named Paul Allen right beside me, telling me 
how to be the best there is...? Or, even if I did capture a picture of a “ghost car”, or even if I did something 
that has never been done in history...

My cool factor isn’t high enough in other people’s eyes for me to be taken seriously.
Not cool enough to make my way out of being a product. 
So, someone’s gonna try to treat me like I’m a product. Oh well. Game over. 
Time to drown myself in sorrow, and just, give up. Nothing I can even do. 
Not even allowed to make people laugh. Nah. 

Suppose that I found a way to communicate with the dead... and that’s what was giving me all these clues, tips,
and tricks...? Ya know? Edgar Allen Poe, just somehow foreshadowing this whole entire period of time... where 
a man lived his actual life, that man being me.

Look, I could literally write this stuff for days, weeks, months at a time, and somehow know that I’m 
impressing somebody who’s watching. Doesn’t wanna admit they’re watchin, but, I know they’re doin’ that. 

Even though IP theft is just about the same exact thing as (ACTUAL theft/larceny), where money or goods are 
stolen, the police can actually remain indifferent because there’s only so much they can do. Federal privacy 
laws don’t exist, so, they don’t really care unless you are ALREADY rich or famous or respected in a community, 
like Daniel Pickett is. 

Truth be told this law...
Uniting and Strengthening America - Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism...
...was not written to abuse and then generate profit and revenue off of it. 

However, THAT IS WHAT IT IS BEING USED FOR. SORTA STATED THIS OPENLY AND LOUDLY BACK ON 05/25/20 in...

...ya know...? It’s not like I was babbling about stupid shit or anything like that, nah.
I was basically just saying that some people are ABUSING THE PATRIOT ACT, in order to...?
Generate revenue. That’s just it man. It wasn’t meant to be exploited with that specific goal in mind.
It was specifically designed to INVESTIGATE and PROTECT AGAINST TERRORISM.

But it is ALSO used for STEALING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, and then selling it to a company like Nfrastructure if 
it’s worth somethin’... all in all, some people owe me a lot more than a fuckin’ apology, that’s for damn sure.

Yeah, if people didn’t think I had an idea that’s what I detected, or thought was going on...? It’s the reason 
why I made a recording on January 11th, 2019.

So, the above link goes to a couple of documents that I found in a box that my father tucked away in the
attic, it wasn’t collected or anything, nor looked at by the police like Joe Pugeliese, the Albany District 
Attorney who charged Zontell Gordon, Clifton Williamson, and Tyrell Crawford with murdering my father on 10/23/95.

When I tried to talk to my aunt Nancy on 07/11/22 about what I found in the box, [she told me to go fuck myself*].

My father used to PROGRAM IN BASIC. And, was programming something pretty cool when he attended HVCC.
THEN- somebody stole some shit from my father’s vehicle, which means that someone stole my father’s intellectual
property. Ah man. That’s why I’m making a stink over it, because … 
_____________________________________________________________
| It really feels like I’m living in 1984, by George Orwell |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
My father basically knew how to program some of the things that Terry Davis programmed on the Commodore64.
And, somebody stole something from my father and basically caused my father to lose interest in something he 
was pretty good at doing, based on the content of his notebooks from the box.

Regardless, pin all of that in memory.
My father, got himself killed and everything, nobody bats an eye as to whether someone would try to run and gun
me down later on... 

Then, somebody had access to my smartphone and listened to that recording, even though I’d never actually sent
it to anybody. Which means that somebody was accessing my phone FREELY STEALING MY IDEAS.

It was passed into law on the predication that it would be used to combat this thing called TERRORISM. 
Cause it’s like, part of the fuckin’ name and everything.

I believe that the EVENT that caused it to be rushed into law as fast as it was, is because it wasn’t meant 
to be used to combat terrorism at all. It was meant to convert the United States of America into a monarchy,   
Surveillance Capitalism, where money is actually far more important than people. When I tell people that, 
they are rarely thoughtful enough to process that sentence. They don’t understand what it means to them.

The reason is twofold. 1) The average American, clings onto the idea that they have rights, and that we live 
in a democracy, so when they hear the words pseudo communist state, they fail to realize that 
“Surveillance Capitalism” is the same fucking thing. 2) The person I just said that to, knows that I am correct, 
and has just identified me as a threat to national security. 

The reason I know this as true, is because of the SILENT ALARM that they initiated at Stratton Air National 
Guard, back in September 7th 2020. I was sitting on a curb near the gate, writing down a link to a YouTube 
video I made, and then the alarm started going off, but it was a quiet alarm. 

The problem, is that most people think they have freedom, and opportunities in this country. 
But nobody really has opportunities in this country, unless they make NO indication whatsoever, that they can
actually see how fucked up it is. When I say that the British Monarchy basically runs America, I mean that 
quite literally. The British Monarchy basically had everything to do with the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001.
That means, the Pentagon, the Twin Towers, and commandeering Albany Airport, New York.

So many people think that the US military would NEVER, EVER kill a bunch of innocent people, because if they 
did... somebody would’ve done something about that by now, right...?                               (← FALLACY ALERT) 

You’re right, somebody DID do something about it, by now. About 12 years ago, (JULIEN ASSANGE/WikiLeaks), 
decided to work with Bradley Manning, and distributed "Collateral Murder", a video which reveals how the 
US military killed 12 civilians in New Baghdad Iraq, in 2007, 2 of those civilians were reporters for the
organization Reuters, and they submitted a FOIL request for information about the attack.

JULIEN ASSANGE isn’t even a US citizen, but I would go so far as to say, that he did the citizens of the 
United States a service, equivalent to that of General McKenzie dutifully serving in the United States 
Marine Corps from 1979 to 2022, 43 years in total. 

I’m not suggesting that JULIEN ASSANGE’s service outshines that of a lifelong military general from the 
Marine Corps such as General McKenzie... because that would be fucking ridiculous. However, it’s still 
worthy to consider, how someone who isn’t even a US citizen, would take one for the team, and allow himself
to get stuck in prison for the next *checks watch* 175 years. 

Based on my estimation, that means Julien will have to live 3 consecutive times... Each of those times...? 
He’s gotta serve his entire life, ALL over again, in the same prison cell... He’s gonna need to be potty 
trained, learn his ABC’s, 123’s, basically go through grade school all over again... it’s gonna be one long 
boring ass fiasco for a guy who didn’t think he was gonna get thrown in prison for... *trailed off* a really 
long fuckin’ time.

Pretty sure the whole lived-an-entire-lifetime-in-prison-till-I-died, but-then-I-came-back-to-life-again, 
just-to-live-an-additional-lifetime-in-prison, do-that-3-or-4-times-back-to-back before he’ll actually get 
out of prison. In other words, unless somebody does something about this injustice, the man isn’t goin’ 
anywhere. I thought that the world APPRECIATED things like JOURNALISM. Apparently I didn’t get the memo... 
cause, if there’s a point I can make at all, is that the punishment doesn’t fit the crime. Ya know...?

If a girl wakes you up with a blow job, but you wanted to sleep a while longer, DON’T just assault her... my 
buddy told me he used to do that. Girl’s trying to wake ya up with a pleasant surprise, I don’t think punching
her in the head, is really a punishment that fits the crime... AKA “fucking excessive, bro.”

Probably a bad analogy... So, let’s say some 7-year old kid steals a candy bar, that must mean that it’s time to
rip this kids fuckin’ legs off. (← EXCESSIVE/PUNISHMENT DOES NOT FIT THE “CRIME”)

Then again, really, if we’re gonna talk about things that are excessive, consider why HILLARY CLINTON is serving 
out that same 175 years in prison, as well. That’s fuckin’ quite excessive, isn’t it...? Holy hell... OH wait, my
bad, nah, she’s totally doin’ whatever the hell she wants to cause she’s special. 

Well, if I was trying to get somebody’s attention, I’m certain that somebody IS paying attention after all. 
JULIEN ASSANGE, was performing a similar role to Edward Snowden, who I consider to be AS patriotic as 
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, basically one of the country’s founding fathers whom I began writing this document talking 
about. He probably had a real deep inside look, at how America was slowly being converted back into a monarchy... 

I gotta say, I haven’t reviewed all of the documents Snowden leaked, but I’ve seen coverage from PBS Frontline,  
Citizenfour, and Snowden starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I really would like to take a deeper look at all the
documents he leaked. I’m not certain what’s the most relevant or important documents to read, but here is the 
“quick” rundown of our modern equivalent to a Colonial Minuteman, Edward “Paul Revere” Snowden...

Edward J. Snowden (06/21/83) a US cybercommando who knew some funny business was goin’ down around the government 
underbelly archives at the (NSA/National Security Agency). So, in 2013 he kinda got fed up with it...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Snowden : Guess it’s time to leak a bunch of highly classified info, dude...
Guy     : Well, why would you wanna do that...?
Snowden : *shakes head* Somethin’ ain’t right, bro.
          Somethin’ mad shady is goin’ on around here...
Guy     : Whaddya gonna do...?
Snowden : I think I might have to do something unprecedented.
          It is the RESPONSIBILITY of EVERY citizen, to QUESTION AUTHORITY.
Guy     : ...it is...?
Snowden : Yeah man.
          Every citizen... not just a few of em.
Guy     : Well, what am I supposed to even question...?
Snowden : Stuff that doesn’t sound right, stuff like that...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Teaching people what questions to ask, is difficult to do. But- questions like “Why does HILLARY CLINTON get a 
free pass, while JULIEN ASSANGE gets 175 years in prison... for doing essentially the same friggen thing...?” 
Well, that’s a perfect question right there. 

Ed Snowden’s disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, basically, top deck awareness all day.
Some run by the NSA and Five Eyes (not Five Guys) Intel Alliance with coop. from telecom companies 
and Euro governments, and kickstarted the discussion regarding (national security/individual privacy).

In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor cause they needed a cybercommando like no other.
One that had a reputation for things like 
______________________________________
| INTEGRITY | PERSEVERANCE | HONESTY | 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
So, needless to say, they don’t make these decisions lightly. They took one look at this dude’s profile...? 
And the guys at the NSA were impressed… they realized that Ed Snowden had what it took… to sit at THEIR table.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

NSA Guy 1 : Hey, this dude right here... looks like he could help us take things to the next level.
NSA Guy 2 : *scoffs* You always say that though... *shakes head* Who is he...?
NSA Guy 1 : His name is Edward Snowden. He’s, a cybercommando/wizard/keyboard warrior.
NSA Guy 2 : All that sounds made up, though... 
            That’s really on his resume...?
NSA Guy 1 : Well...
            Not only does it say that...?
            But he’s straight up from the Central Intelligence Agency...
            So...
NSA Guy 2 : That’s what’s up, though...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Snowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved, and that he tried 
to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored. (← FOLLOWS PARALLEL PATTERN/THEME w/ ME)

(05/20/13), Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early 
June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists...

...Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian, 
The Washington Post, and other publications. Snowden also made extensive allegations against the GCSB, blowing 
the whistle of their domestic surveillance of New Zealanders and acts of espionage under John Key’s gov’t.

(6/21/13) US Dept. of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of 2x violations the Espionage Act of 1917
and theft of gov’t property, following which the Dept of State revoked his passport. 2 days later, he flew 
into Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport, where Russian authorities observed the canceled passport, 
and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over [1 month (insanity)]. Russia later granted Snowden 
the right of asylum with an initial visa for residence for one year, which was subsequently repeatedly 
extended. In Oct. 2020, he was granted permanent residency in Russia.

Anyway, yeah, Edward “BENJAMIN FRANKLIN” Snowden was told my many a dude here or there, that he’s not invited
to their birthday party anymore... Which sucks for them, doesn’t it...? A lot of people tried to label 
this dude as a traitor to his own country, or a dissident or coward... right...? But that makes about as much 
sense as saying that BENJAMIN FRANKLIN never did a damn thing for the United States of America. 

Of course, everyone in earshot will probably: “BRO, HE WAS A FOUNDING FATHER, HES’ ON THE `$100 BILL...”
That person will try to argue with them “Yeah just cause he’s on the `$100 bill, doesn’t mean anything.”
But, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN did a lot of things for America. He literally handed out stamps of approval cause he 
was a Postmaster General. He was also the 6th governor/president of Pennsylvania.

Yeah man, that’s what people are basically saying, “OoOOOoooHhhhh Ed Snowden guy is big trouble...”
Nah, really what has been happening is that sometimes the police will commit a crime, and then accuse someone 
else of committing the crime that THEY just committed... and then they’ll arrest someone that didn’t commit 
that crime at all. 

“You obviously did something to deserve it, otherwise, you wouldn’t be in this position...” (← No, you’re right...)

The dude literally caught the equivalent of like 1000 Justin Belleville’s walking around the bank lobby after 
hours, committing thousands of cases of fraud, and then when he realized that his superiors didn’t actually 
give a shit...? Oh. Maybe that’s how he got in the position he’s in. Superiors that should probably care about
1000 Justin Belleville’s swapping cash from one drawer to another.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Relevant Details",@"
As for General McKenzie, that dude has spent his entire life being in the military
Marine Corps from 1979 to 2022, 43 years in total. If anyone’s a fuckin’ patriot, he sure as hell is. 
Fuckin’ dude has probably had his fair share of crawling under barbed wire in the mud, while being shot at, barely 
making it out of enemy territory, alive... by the skin of his teeth at times, probably...

But, sometimes even THEY make mistakes. 
They’d really rather not have stains on their legacy, but sometimes that shit’s unavoidable, and they will
get REALLY pissed, when a citizen exposes something as bad as "Collateral Murder", and my god... 
...SOME people will actually hire a team of private military contractors to get me to shut the fuck up already.

Cool (sarcasm). I’m gonna say it right now that I don’t think General McKenzie is doin’ stuff like that.
I will go over relevant subjects before I take a dive into his resume.

Look, Collateral Murder is pretty bad, no way around it. Anyone involved in the murder of a bunch of JOURNALISTS,
probably made a mistake. The mistake part isn’t what made the situation as bad as it was. Trying to cover it up 
with some white out, deny a FOIL request, and not give the grieving families just makes that entire chain of
command... questionable. I have no doubt that this dude probably had no involvement with that directly...
...but he WAS stationed in Iraq at or about that time.

If releasing a video like “Collateral Murder” pissed of some people in the US government, it 
stands to reason that SOMEBODY was pretty fucking embarrassed by it. Whether it was HIM, or someone else, 
I’m fairly certain this dude knows who’s responsible for the “mistake”, AS WELL AS, the FOIL request denial,
AS WELL AS, who would get mad pissed at Bradley Manning over declassifying/decrypting the video.

Considering that he was the 14th Commanding Officer of CENTCOM... he’s gonna be a credible source for facts.
Now, check this out. 

Most citizens realized just how fucked up that whole situation was. NOW, they’re not sayin’ stuff like 
"those journalists obviously must’ve been doing something to deserve being killed like that, otherwise they 
wouldn’t have gotten killed." (← FALLACY ALERT)

I’m not exaggerating, most U.S. civilians believe that the military, gov’t, nor police EVER commit crimes.
You could literally SHOW them the incident with George Floyd/Derek Chauvin, and they’ll say “Obviously, that
guy was an exception.” Yeah, but the problem is, people don’t realize how often these EXCEPTIONS occur.
They happen so often, that it’s worth getting pretty heated with people that aren’t listening.

You could tell them “it happens every fucking day, dude...” And amazingly, they will find that too difficult
to believe. I’m fuckin’ dead serious. I have arguments with my mother STILL. I swear, her generation has too
many people that probably had lead poisoning or brain damage from the lead in the gasoline that they used to
put in gasoline all the time.

I don’t like to tell people about how heated my arguments with her get sometimes... because people will try to
tell me “Shouldn’t talk to your mother like that.” Well, if I tell her THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING
BUT THE TRUTH, SO HELP ME GOD, EVEN PUT MY HAND ON A BIBLE BEFORE I DO THAT... Oh. She’ll STILL say that 
whatever I’m saying is bullshit. (← HIGHLY DYSFUNCTIONAL)

She is SO DYSFUNCTIONAL, that my father literally told this woman “HEY, I THINK SOMEBODY IS LOOKING FOR ME...”
And my mother, thought my father was just being paranoid. Nah. A lot of people thought he was just being 
“paranoid”. So if I try to tell people “Ah yeah my father was murdered and 3 guys spent 25+years in prison...”
They’ll say “So what...?” Then I’ll say “Well, I think the reason that someone tried to do that to ME, is 
literally because the same people that had my father killed...? Well, they tried to get me killed too.”
When I say “the same people”... I don’t mean the 3 guys that never named the trigger man. Cause, the OTHER
explanation, is that they were all paid to keep their fuckin’ mouths shut. OooOoOOoooOOOhhhHHHHh. 

But, my mother will argue with me because she thinks that there’s NO WAY that’s possible. (← FALLACY ALERT)
She’s never ONCE looked in this box of documents my father left behind. Neither has anyone else in my family.
The box of documents, I tried to show the (5) police officers that were at my house on:
07/14/20 | SCSO-2020-040845 | (NYSP 2G62/Deputy Messines Jr.), Anthony Agresta, Paul Zurlo, NYSP 2G36, and NYSP 2G32
The (1) dude from the NYSP had a conversation with me that went like this:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Trooper : Looks like a FEDERAL CASE you’ve got there, chum...
Me      : Alright.
          I’m kinda aware of that...
          Maybe you could help me get in touch with them...?
Trooper : Look buddy, I really can’t be doin’ that.
          Not to be a dick or nothing, it’s just that frankly, I don’t give a shit.
          I don’t get paid to give a shit about stuff in a box related to a 25 year old homicide.
Me      : Cool.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Cause, people like my mother, they don’t actually care about threats to their constitutional rights... 
...my mother will say I obviously did something to deserve being in this position. Cool. Nah. I didn’t 
have anything to do with someone disabling my iPhone 8+ to prevent me from extracting the (1) video
IMG_0647.mov which was a 20m+ video that I spent like an entire week trying to record.

The truth is...? Now there are people that can prevent victims from being able to SHARE EVIDENCE OF SOMEONE 
like George Floyd being killed by Derek Chauvin. They’ve had this ability for some time. So you can record 
a video of (2) men attempting to murder you, LIKE I DID... AND GUESS WHAT...? Someone will remotely disable
your device... So if you hadn’t gotten the evidence OFF of the device...? You’re fucked. That is TOP NOTCH 
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

As for “Collateral Murder”... 
Maybe some of the people out there realized that they had never seen such a SHOCKING, JARRING thing, 
where they were fuckin’ lied to by someone wicked important. Then, it stands to reason... while MOST people 
may believe that’s an isolated incident, it probably won’t happen again, they’re sure of it, it was a big   
misunderstanding...? 
Most people will go RIGHT back, to believing that it’ll never happen again. Cool. 
Setting themselves up for disappointment without hesitation.

However, some people sat there and thought, "Well, if they did it this ONE time... how many OTHER times have 
they done it...?" Hm. It’s a great question. Not that many people really stop and ASK it, though.
General McKenzie took accountability for a mistake that occurred where 7 children and 3 adults were killed,
after the Kabul https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Kabul_airport_attack
I really hope that OTHER PEOPLE follow that example he set, where if someone made a fuckin’ mistake...?
Own up to it IMMEDIATELY. Sweeping it under the rug, pretending like it doesn’t matter...
...nah, our BROKEN SOCIETY HAS CAUSED PEOPLE TO RATIONALIZE THAT, AND IT FUCKIN’ DEFINITELY DOES MATTER.

Here’s how it works.
Someone orders a drone strike, and it kills a shitload of kids in Afghanistan. 
Not a room full of Afghan SOLDIERS... but an entire school full of kids. Carelessness.
THEN, the demon flies around the world, and causes KARMA to unfold as a gunman breaking into a school, whereby
killing 19 kids and 2 teachers. But, amazingly, the numbers continue to pile up.

Most people don’t bother to make that CORRELATION, as they never ask themselves a single question along the 
lines of: "Has this happened BEFORE or SINCE...?" 
     
Well, assuming that it’s happened plenty of times before, AND since, is a safe assumption to make.
The reason WHY, is because people really doubted that Ted Bundy was a bad guy.
Ted Bundy, is one of the most notorious serial killers in modern history...
...and he killed a LOT of women because THEY all thought “I don’t think that guy would DO something like that.”
Sure. I gotta say...? People need some education. Because, there are serial killers that work with the police.
And, the military. And, politicians. Not exaggerating that at all.    

So, when people say "I find that incredibly difficult to believe", they say that because they’re a moron. 
“I don’t think they would do something like that AGAIN...”
Ah. Ok, check this out... imagine hundreds of these incidents all in a single video...
One incident after another, just tell people to watch YouTube channel “Audit the Audit”.
MAYBE, that channel doesn’t focus on people getting killed... it focuses on how the police will OBNOXIOUSLY 
VIOLATE PEOPLE’S RIGHTS ANYWAY.

At some point, people WILL stop saying stuff like “I find that incredibly difficult to believe.”
BUT- those people have to AUDIBLY STATE THOSE WORDS, because if they SAY NOTHING...?
Then it will just continue to happen to additional people.

Then, you see some shit like that on Vice Media. 
Vice Media will straight up tell people that there’s a serious problem with our government taking 
accountability for shit.

Sometimes I reread all of this content and I think I’m a little too blunt... 
...however, there is only a small window of opportunity, where I don’t need to insult anybody at all...
...and they find my reasoning plausible. 

The problem is, people really are too trusting of other people. It’s only human to do such a thing, but there 
comes a point where people have to more collectively decide as a society “HEY, MAYBE WE SHOULDN’T JUST LIE 
CONSTANTLY...” 

Because, if THEY lie, and then THEY trust people would NEVER lie to them...? 
What the hell do they really know...?
Uh, nothing really.
They’re taking things on FAITH.
They know with ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY, they’re NOT being lied to...
...but they sure as shit ARE being lied to. 
They don’t see the ERROR in their thought processes. 

These people don’t quite understand the REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY aspect of my rhetoric sometimes.
So if I say “It’s okay if THEY lie, nobody will ever expect when THEY lie.” (← REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY)
Now, nobody even says the truth, ever.

To them, everything someone else said has GOTTA be the truth... right? (← FALLACY ALERT)
It’s stupid. You really can’t COACH people on how to be fuckin’ honest, either. 
They just gotta live their life, and find out. 

Some people spent their whole life being nice to people, workin’ their asses off, kissin’ the bosses ass...
...never once in their entire life did they ever know with sheer certainty, when someone would lie to them.

However, the reason why this document exists, to try and coach people to stop doing that needlessly.

Cause, taking people at their word...? I’m not saying that everyone lies all the time, and that trying to 
trust people is foolish... But, most people lack the INTELLIGENCE, to determine with SHEER CERTAINTY, when 
someone has just: lied to their face, with a smile I might add – this is definitely a bold statement to make.

But, it’s accurate. So, if I begin to feel as if assaulting somebody who just lied to me, might be a good idea 
soon, I’m gonna show signs of aggression FIRST. Body language, tone of my voice, my eyes will narrow, I might
sound irritated... society trains people to tune all of that shit out. Don’t tune all that shit out at all.
Won’t be like a “WHOOPS, fuckin’... I spazzed out and my fist flew at ya involuntarily... my bad, bro...” 
Ya know...? Pretty sure that doesn’t happen that often... like, Tourette’s but just in terms of assaulting 
some poor fool for being 3 minutes off...

If I go to that length, they’ll know why they were assaulted. 
The other people will think that I just assaulted some poor man for no reason. 
Just to be clear, I don’t do something like that unless it has been a consistent pattern.
Every lie ever told carries a “weight”. If a dude tells me that it’s 6:59 when it’s 7:02...? 
I’m not ever gonna flip out for that, cause that lie doesn’t carry much weight. 
HOWEVER, if it’s a matter of someone lying about trying to KILL ME, or HIT ME WITH THEIR CAR...?
THEN it will feel like a very “weighty” lie.

There is ALWAYS a reason to go so far, where punches get thrown. 
People TYPICALLY don’t get themselves punched in the face like that for no reason... 
The reason could be, that motherfucker just lied to me. 
I knew he was lying because I’m smart enough to detect it, and I’ll teach other people how to do that too. 

But when people just assume I did that for no reason, that does actually piss me off. 
Our society says “There’s no reason to assault people...” But, yeah there is sometimes.
It’s actually better than people getting shot to death and killed.

If people actually ASK “Why did you assault that poor man...?” 
Uh, well... the guy lied, and deserved to be assaulted. 
A guy saying “It’s 6:57” when it’s 7:03, isn’t really a good reason to assault somebody.
However, seeing a dude raping a woman in an alleyway, is a PERFECT REASON TO ASSAULT THEM.

Sometimes, it’s a good idea to take a deep breath and say “woosah”...
Most of the time, that is the best advice.
Because if you just openly assault EVERYBODY instead of using psychological strategies...?
Then you will go to jail. You might hurt somebody pretty badly. 

“Woosah”. Breathe in slowly...? “woo”. Take like, 10 full seconds, before you breath out slowly... “sah”. 
Nah, cause if you DON’T do that, then you might take your anger out on innocent people that didn’t actually 
DO ANYTHING, to deserve such disrespect. If you disrespect someone, they will tune every word out. 

There is an incredibly small window where psychological strategies will actually prove victorious.
Nobody gets hurt, people learn the truth, someone will probably be embarrassed because the truth was made
quite apparent to other people... but- bruised egos are a lot better than people getting injured and hurt.
But- in order to be effective at this strategy, it needs to be readily apparent, that you will bare your teeth
and clench your fist to stand up for YOURSELF, and your POINT.

They’re gonna believe when they’re told by the lying injured man, that he did nothing to deserve that at 
all~! Nah, he did... He was as deceitful as Ted Bundy, and someone was actually lookin’ out for everybody else.

Here’s an audio recording. *play it back* 
Then they may say, “How can you tell he just lied to you in this recording...?” 
I’ll say, “Listen to it again, lady...”.  (← this statement will vary in delivery)  

Listening to audio recordings over and over, of OTHER PEOPLE’s responses, helps train your brain to be able 
to disseminate them in real time. You can’t expect to show up in public and ONLY show a nice side... 
A lot of people do that, there’s nothing wrong with it, but there’s a whole other half of that person that 
is never conveyed, so like... I could imagine that Ed Snowden has been pretty pissed off from time to time, 
that he’s stuck in Russia. Sometimes being optimistic doesn’t work. The negativity gets to everybody.

Regardless, everybody feels those emotions too. And, being honest with one’s self helps to study and examine 
things over and over, then people stop insulting someone’s intelligence. When they listen to it 5 times, or 
maybe even 20 times, they start to understand how to listen to the “microexpressions” in someone’s voice, because 
they actually began to apply "EFFORT", cause they wanted to know if that man would ever lie to them.

The word “Microexpression” is pretty important, I don’t know the OFFICIAL term for it applying to voice, 
but, they are part of the psyche that people can’t control. Subtle vocalizations cannot actually be CONTROLLED,
and those are the signs that someone is being deceitful or hiding something. The last several paragraphs 
really has a lot more to do with psychological stuff, if anything... but it probably should stay right here.

Trusting people that should’ve never been trusted to begin with, is worse than someone blowing off some steam. 
They had a feeling that man lied to them a lot of times before, but that he was such a friendly dude... They 
might get wicked pissed off at my mouth...? But I told them the truth, and they just didn’t want to hear it. 
Then they assumed that I was some random asshole that had no reason to do what I did, at all. Nah. There was
definitely a fuckin’ reason alright, and I was offended that someone thought I had no business doing what I did. 

They liked him a lot. They liked him, cause they really wanted to fuck him. Whenever someone told them that dude 
was a fuckin’ lying sack of shit, she just didn’t believe it. “No way is that dude a lying sack of shit. I like 
him. He’s... the best there is.” Meanwhile, this dude constantly talked a lot of shit about her (among others), 
told her how stupid she was when she wasn’t around, and she believed him every fuckin’ time he lied to her. I’m  
literally talking about Ms. Devoe from the Orchard. Dwayne Coonradt used to talk so much shit about this lady, 
every fuckin’ time. I could tell her the gods honest truth, and she will fuckin’ disbelieve it all.

I don’t really want to tell someone like her, that she’s a fool to trust that dude for a single fuckin’ minute. 
He would sell his own fuckin’ kid, to save his own sorry ass. That’s why he isn’t anybody’s father. Realistically, 
if someone tells you that someone is doing something or is deceptive, you can’t allow your own feelings to get 
in the way of the truth. 

And THAT is why I resort to calling people names, and insulting them... it doesn’t feel good to some people to
be insulted, but- it might jar up enough sense FOR them, to analyze the situation, and reconsider changing 
the way they feel. Because they may be set in their ways, and suggestions won’t likely work.

It works a lot better than making casual suggestions to people who aren’t open minded at all, as they will 
ignore you. Long story short, the devil is in the details.

I suppose if someone went around Nazi Germany in 1940ish, and said that Hitler told that person he planned on 
killing millions of Jewish people, they would’ve all said "You are fuckin’ psychotic dude." 

Here’s a fact: millions of them should’ve listened. 
They didn’t. I’m not saying anyone KNEW that Hitler had these plans in store, but- if someone told me that 
someone DID actually know ahead of time, I would find that PLAUSIBLE. So, everybody just said: 
"You’re out of your mind, to think that a great leader like Hitler, would do something terrible like that."
Because at SOME point LATER, Hitler decided to go full-out, murderous evil tyrant, and killed millions of 
Jewish people, nearly exterminating an entire category of people.

Why...? Cause he was a fuckin’ evil bastard. Not even gonna joke about what an evil fuckin demonic individual 
HIM, Stalin, and Mao Zedong all were. 

Even if someone DID know, AND, people called the police to tell the Nazi police: 
“Some dude keeps saying Hitler is gonna kill millions of Jews~!”
Well, it accomplished NOTHING HELPFUL AT ALL. 
Cause, Hitler told them "There’s no way I would ever kill millions of Jews.
I happen to be half-Jewish myself. That would be UNTHINKABLE.”

Sounds a lot like some lines from Macbeth, by William Shakespeare.
Those people didn’t realize how moronic it was, to assume that the police would do something about it.
Oh, they did do SOMETHING about it... Yeah. That fuckin’ idiot that tried to WARN EVERYBODY... died.
OR, maybe he was SENTENCED TO 175 YEARS IN PRISON.       (← Yeah, JULIEN ASSANGE/Edward Snowden tried to warn people)

I really hope that humanity has learned a lesson from World War II.
I don’t think that they have, I’m afraid.
There’s a reason why people should question authority, because “Absolute power corrupts absolutely.”
Because, the oil industry is a LOT worse than all (3) of those evil fucks I just listed.
When the planet runs COMPLETELY out of oil, billions of people will starve to death, and die.

There’s really nothing comedic about (millions/billions) of people dying. 
There IS however, something VERY comedic, about when people ASSUME that someone’s out of their fuckin’ mind, 
when they’re the only one among them that is correct.
    
SOME people will stop, and watch that video again, and again. This particular video, is nowhere near as alarming
as the events of World War II and the Holocaust, however...? It’s not something people should just throw in the 
trash. It’s something people should pay close attention to, because like I said... Some of those demons
rise up from the wreckage and rubble of the drone strikes that weren’t VALID TARGETS...
...and that motherfucker is gonna fly all around the globe, and erupt as another classroom full of dead
children, or it might be a nursing home, or even a Walmart.

It’s good to get pretty creative about something sinister AHEAD OF TIME, because then people can talk about
a solution that makes total sense. 500 people in a Walmart, just, all getting killed by a gunman who used
2x tractor trailers, and blocked all of the exits, so that he could waltz right in with his bulletproof suit,
and just carry thousands of rounds of ammunition, and kill every single person in the building, and nobody 
stood a fuckin’ chance, either.

Just cause I said it, doesn’t mean I’m the bad guy who’s gonna do that.
Nah. But, some people will think that I MUST have those thoughts. 
THEN, someone’s gonna point their finger in my face for doing the SAME EXACT THING that a screenwriter in 
Hollywood would write... not even kidding. I have to EXPECT, that someone from Britain will actually do 
EVERYTHING possible, to prevent me from invoking my first amendment rights, to freely express myself... 

Not because what I said was ALARMING, but rather, because I think that they know how compelling it is to 
WARN people with these scenarios. Simply put, I think Britain ENJOYS watching our countrymen slaughter each 
other... I think it’s absolutely fuckin’ sick, and it has a 1776 vibe to it, too. Yeah, I think that Britain
just kept pounding the United States with the bullshit tea anyway... eventually, they found a way to force
someone like George W. Bush, to accept defeat.

They will think to themselves that Julien was onto something, and maybe they’ll dig a little deeper. 
Now, I wouldn’t have spent the last few years racking my brain talking about these two guys, the modern 
Minutemen... if I didn’t CLEARLY SEE, that something fucked up is going on. 

The only people that can do anything about it, are the people that take action, and basically have nothing 
left to lose. I don’t mean that it’s time to mow down people with guns, because that’s a LAST MEASURE.

What I CAN say, is that there might not be too much time left on the clock before we’re ALL defenseless, 
because the second amendment was written for a reason and I don’t actually agree with Jon Oliver about
gun control at all. Anyone sounding like they’re looking to take control of guns...? They’re basically 
trying to make us DEFENSELESS.

When I say take action I don’t mean shit like 01/06/21. That was just a clusterfuck, if anything. 
What I mean is, basically putting one’s self in Assange or Snowden’s shoes, willingly. 

You can’t expect someone that’s still attached to society, to fuckin’ get it. Not without reprogramming.
Cause some people will actually laugh at me, in my face when I tell them:
“Yeah, I’m gonna get Julien out of prison, and Ed Snowden a ticket home.”

Why do I keep sayin’ that to people...? It’s cause I see the strong sense of INJUSTICE all across the board.
When the US works with Britain to extradite JULIEN ASSANGE? It’s because his own queen sold him out.
Prince Andrew, represents a perfect example, of how believable these people look, when they flat out lie.
Yeah, Prince Andrew never slept with Mrs. Guiffre, nah. That man flat out swore up and down, that he’d never 
seen this woman at all, in his entire life. Except, ah man. There’s a fuckin’ picture of the dude, and her.
You gotta think, Prince Andrew...? He’s a dumb motherfucker. Even Jeffrey Epstein said it.

Yeah, Princess Diana had a pretty “royal family killed her” vibe to it.

Nobody understands what a threat to their constitutional rights and liberties that is, for American citizens.
Then again, if the British monarchy basically took over America without letting a lot of people know, then 
basically we’re right fuckin back to 1776, only this time, it’s a lot more dangerous.
Cause the National Security Agency and the Five Eyes are basically under the royal family’s control.

It’s worse than that too, because everybody’s smartphone has a Trojan horse installed from the factory, like,
Apple is worth `$3T for a very key specific reason. Why do these devices NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL SWITCH...?
Ohhhhhh, maybe it’s because a design feature allows the device to remain powered on even if you turn it off.
So, Apple has no idea that ALL OF THEIR DEVICES ARE DANGEROUS. Mainly because of Pegasus alone.

Some dude who’s a citizen of a totally different country, was lookin’ out for everybody else. 
Somebody said "Fuck you bro. You’re not helpin’ ANYBODY anymore..." and then he was brought to prison in England...
where he tried to get married a few weeks ago, and then said

Assange: Babe, we can’t do this... the cunts over in the United States just really prefer that I live out the 
rest of my days in a fuckin’ prison cell. Can’t put you through this life I’m stuck living.

Though, those were not the actual words he said to the woman who was STILL willing to marry this dude, there 
are a number of cowardly cunts that run our government... and that’s fine. I don’t expect a lot of em to have 
any integrity for any remainder of time left on the 175-year clock Julien is looking at. I’m fairly certain that 
the current government has no control or say over that sentence at all. I think that his sentence is strictly
because of Exxon Mobil, and the oil/gas industry, as well as the car industry. 

Otherwise, he wouldn’t be in the prison cell he’s been sitting in... who would prefer that he remain stuck in 
that prison cell... Why...? Some people like to remain in power even though they broke the law and probably met the  
criteria to be charged for a crime such as treason. 

So what I’m suggesting, is that the “hidden government” whether it’s a combination of British monarchy, or it’s 
corrupt American oil companies, or it’s somewhere in the middle, Julien pissed em off, AND, they’re responsible 
for the 9/11/2001 terrorist attacks.

Idk man, I think that over the last 9 years, America has basically gone from something that felt really American, 
capitalist as usual... and now it’s basically a communist state. I still remember this fuckin’ CVE-2019-8936, and 
the Wannacry derivative... how it felt like I was about to be sick, because it meant that someone was watchin’... 
and that’s when all these things that Assange and Snowden were saying that whole fuckin’ time, started to make a
whole lot of sense to me. 

For instance, suppose that you work for somebody, and you work each week 80-120 hours a week sometimes, and then 
for some reason the boss man can NOW use a CVE to avoid paying somebody for 40-80 hours that person worked each 
week. OR, a former employer can fuckin’ connect to my smartphone and steal my intellectual property or listen to 
my audio recordings without letting ME know that they did such a thing, and if they heard something they thought 
was mad cool and they could turn a profit off of it...? Then fuck me, AND my idea around privacy. I recorded an 
audio recording with such a COOL idea, and it wasn’t even mine anymore once I stated it into the microphone.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Original [~] The Uncanny Valley",@"
Go on an adventure with me.
Step into the uncanny valley.
You’re uncertain what this adventure leads to...
...but you are in a state of mind, a time, and a place...
...where the unreal becomes real...
...the unknown becomes known...
...and what you assumed, did not exist...?
It has been there this whole time.

Like sleeping with a blade in hand, or drinking poison that could easily take your life, 
the uncanny valley is not child’s play.

When you think of this place, your awareness becomes heightened.
Your insecurities become your only defense...
...because this state of uncertainty, is all that is keeping you alive.

*pause*
Good. Hopefully that just woke your ass up. Time to land a rhetorical question...

What if, the things you take for granted, the things you wholly believe in, the things you’re not sure why you 
like, the things you have no other explanation for doing, other than... because everyone else does it too...?

What if, behind these things, this mask you trust, and this LIFE you lead...
...is a demon hiding in plain sight...?
The demon tells you not to worry and fills you with doubt, because it is easier to believe his devilish charm...
...but what if, this demon has been stringing you along through this labyrinth of obstacles you call your life...
...and what if, someone has been trying to tell you this whole time, that what you’re DOING... 
...is playing right into this demons hands...?

As you live your life, this demon may take everything from you.
Every dream you’ve ever believed...? Gone.
Every idea you ever came up with...? Taken from you...
Even if your idea could’ve changed the world for the best...?
This demon took it from you, and used it for the very worst.
Your idea could’ve saved COUNTLESS others, from playing right into this demons hands as well... 
But- ...it was used to take even MORE lives, than just yours.

As this demonic entity grows from the idea you came up with, he only grows stronger and undefeatable.
And the ones you loved and cared for...?
Barely remember who you used to be.
Because they believe in this monster that NOT ONLY TOOK YOUR LIFE,
but- your ever lasting legacy in this world.

I hope that since you’ve come this far in this story, that you think about your surroundings.
I hope that you begin to question what SEEMS like an impossible mistake...
...and that the person trying to wake you from this nightmare, IS TRYING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.
And, not just your life...?
But, your spirit too.

Now, the final question that this story asks, is...
...do you feel alone there, in the uncanny valley...?
Because, the biggest assumption that you most likely made in this story...
...is that I took this adventure INTO, the uncanny valley WITH you.

Your assumptions are your worst enemy.
And they are... that demons best friend.

That is a poem that I wrote, kept taking pictures of it, kept making recordings trying to memorize it...
Cause I had a feeling a long time ago, that this shit was exactly what I think it is, FOR A WHILE.
To elaborate, it’s a warning. 
Basically, intellectual property theft, but I mean, fuckin’ way worse than that.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Injustice",@"
JULIEN ASSANGE’s entire purpose with WikiLeaks was to be a modern Paul Revere. 
He wasn’t doing all this shit to be an annoying asshole trying to be correct all the time... nah. 
He saw some people doing evil shit. 
People that never stopped for a single minute, to reflect on what they fuckin’ did.

He reflected on what they were doing and thought it was unthinkable that an actual country like the 
United States, prides itself on freedom, truth, and liberty... when none of those things are actually true at 
all. Just one lie after another. 

You have “rights” apparently, they’re definitely fuckin’ written in the constitution... 
But now it seems like that thing isn’t used anymore. 
SMART people know what to say, because it was WRITTEN so that the people in America...
...could literally take up arms, form a militia, and rebel against the corrupt government...
...should it ever find itself in the position it was in, back in fuckin’ 1776.

I don’t think the problem is the government itself. I think the problem is a really large negative number.
It’s called “The National Debt”
I keep using this analogy about a toy that someone rents out to another kid. He pays the toy renter a certain
amount each day. But- the renter kid took his toy back, and never told his friend. Still gotta pay for the toy.
Then, he can rent it out to OTHER kids, and do this same thing over and over.
^ The United States National Debt.

Just to be clear here, Britain had a lot of talent, at making tea. The queen chose to send America, the worst 
fuckin’ tea they could make. Had they sent the BEST tea, she wouldn’t have lost so many thousands of her 
soldiers. Instead, she chose to be a cunt. She sent the WORST god damn tea, and the colonists told her to go 
fuck yourself cunt. Not payin’ for that shit, now get the fuck out before we kill your army. And that is 
exactly what they did. 

Months later, they made the decision to come back, because little did they realize, most of them would die. 
This, is what the constitution was literally fucking written for. People abusing their position, or authority, 
having too much power in their hands, having no fear of being killed at all. I gotta say, when someone is 
intelligent enough to know the game being played, that should indicate to somebody that they should stop 
playing that fucking game before they get themselves killed... 
But... I think some people are just too addicted to fucking with people, they can’t help themselves.

If I try to say that specific names and specific people are doin’ some specific stuff... something specific 
is gonna fuckin’ happen to em... Well, that’s retarded. Cause then I’ll lose the element of surprise. So long 
as I make these statements in the most fuckin’ vague way I can, they will know I’m speaking DIRECTLY to them, 
cause they wouldn’t be watching me if they had no idea already. 

The problem is, if THEY want people to truly believe “He’s a nut job” or “guy is psychotic”, THEY have to prove 
that I can’t be reasoned with and THEY continually lose this battle every single day that goes by. I have to 
prove that JULIEN ASSANGE should be exonerated (same with Snowden), so it’s a race. 
      
One side...? A bunch of unruly cunts who are treated exactly like royalty, who have the whole world by the 
balls. No conscious either, just... a lot of estrogen every single day, it clouds their judgement. They ALSO 
shove wicked big dildos up their ass all day - except, that’s not a crime, totally legal. When you force people 
to erase their conscious, you wind up being like Sean Hannity, who has to brush his teeth with RUPERT MURDOCK’s 
hairy nutsack. That’s not a crime either, but sooner or later he’ll have too many ‘jizz-on-the-chin’ situations, 
people will start to catch on.
      
On the other...? Guys like Edward Snowden, JULIEN ASSANGE... and then, me. Why do these guys pop up so often...? 
It’s cause they leaked information about the government doing some real questionable shit that would inevitably 
piss people off. (leading to situations where I spend many days in a row writing that poem above).

Situations where somebody had some jizz-on-the-chin. That’s not a crime in and of itself... because some people 
don’t mind being seen with havin’ a lil bit of jizz-on-the-chin. The only time where jizz being on somebody’s 
chin becomes part of a serious crime or violation of the constitution, is when somebody misreports facts and 
figures, or generalizes the severity of a given situation... and that situation was illegal or unconstitutional.

Probably sounds like I’m making that up... to be perfectly honest, when Sean Hannity says that climate change 
isn’t real, that’s how I know he just sucked RUPERT MURDOCK’s dick that day. Every time, it’s a guarantee that 
he just gargled his semen and it was probably amazing for him. But, you know, if he starts telling people that 
he was paid `$100M a year to tell the world that climate change isn’t real, I’ll stop saying that he sucks 
Rupert Murdock’s fuckin’ dick every day.

Won’t change the fact that he will still be doing that... but at least Sean Hannity will save some face. 
Till then...? I can’t wait to get it on video. Just like Ted Cruz, getting railed in the ass by Exxon Mobil. 
Not only do they both live for the thrill of fucking some other man... they get paid a lot of money too. 
When people say that politicians make more money doing the same thing as a porn star, it’s accurate. 
      
Ted Cruz, I actually feel bad for, because he probably doesn’t enjoy when his asshole bleeds. 
But, he gets a lot of money to shut the fuck up and keep going. Ted... what the fuck dude...? 
Everyone knows you’re not gay. Why do you do this to yourself...? 
Obviously, if the man doesn’t enjoy being fucked in the ass, he shouldn’t force himself to go through with it.   
Because that’s called "rape". 

But, if Ted is willing to cry to himself as it’s happening, and enjoys having all of that money... he’s doing 
that shit to himself, and Exxon Mobil is gonna keep taking advantage of that. Literal tears, streaming down 
Teds face... 
      
Look. As colorful as my language is, the morons JULIEN ASSANGE was looking out for that didn’t feel very 
appreciative for his selfless service, they’ll prove how fuckin’ stupid they are when they say "Well OBVIOUSLY 
he did SOMETHING to deserve being jailed for 175 years." 
Well, what he did to get that time in prison should also be applied to everyone else, with no exceptions. 
But, I know that someone will say "except for..." No exceptions fuckface. Zero.

Which means Hillary should be in prison for a portion of that time too.

Hillary : Yes...? 
          Can I help you...?

Hillary : Oh yeh...? 
          Suck a fuckin’ dick, bro...
Judge   : Nah, Hillary...
          I’m totally serious, you’re like, *checks watch* 6 years late for your prison sentence...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Well, at what point does she take it seriously...? Never...? 
Or, will she put her fingers in her ears, and go “la la la la la, can’t hear you la la” 

Nah, none of that shit will happen.
I can’t really say it’ll NEVER happen, cause it could theoretically happen at some point in time, like 30-50 
years after she’s passed away... or something. But then again, maybe if she knew she was headed to prison, 
MAYBE she could NEGOTIATE Assange’s sentence back down so that if they’re gonna serve equal terms in prison, 
then, she will do her damndest to get Julien’s sentence as low as fuckin’ possible... Might even get him down 
to “Time served”, out ya go.

That’s what’s cool about fictional stories getting thrown into the mix here...  
Not really sure how else to explain all of this, but the best case I can make, is that no exceptions should be 
made for anybody in reference to the law, being above the law, or telling the law to step aside, or, 
minimizing the outcome of the law, or giving the law the middle finger, or somehow violating the law and 
not being seen nor caught doing that... any way you look at it, all of these things mean = being above the 
law. 

If a girl is wearing panties, and you want to have sex with her without taking her panties off, you can move 
em to the side. Or pull em down. Shouldn’t be able to do that in reference to the law, but that’s exactly what 
some people do. 

Like Richard Sackler, or HILLARY CLINTON. Middle finger to the law.

HILLARY CLINTON obviously did something to get that same exact sentence, but they never sent her to prison, 
jail, nor put her in handcuffs. Wanna know why...? People never ask me why. They just, like hating some dude 
for no fuckin’ reason... cause they heard that JULIEN ASSANGE did something REAL bad. 

Yeh. He probably called some woman that was fucking careless with documents that were classified, "careless", 
and not just "EXTREMELY CARELESS", but rather, "so egregious that she caused certain people to get killed   
somewhere..." 

Yeah, what I mean is this... she could technically be blamed for `$1T worth of American military inventory 
that the Taliban now owns... cause, Trump made an agreement with these fucks, and then Biden already had 
his focus split between so many other things... like COVID. But anyway, whatever. 

What if someone at the CIA took pictures of the entire database, and then took a trip to Moscow, and said 
"Yo, check this shit out, it’s like, the whole archive..." Well, the problem at that point, is that anyone 
they have currently dispatched anywhere throughout the world... 
They may possible get fuckin’ killed by somebody now. Why...? Solorigate for (1). 
But also...
Because they’re undercover. Now their cover is blown. Now... Hillary didn’t do anything as bad as that. What 
she did, was allowed a Russian to have a password to an account/archive, and THEN, they were able to commit the 
2016 election interference, as well as silently kill people in the field, and as long as James Comey didn’t say 
shit... they had nothin’ to worry about. 
      
Am I exaggerating...? Yes I am. But at the same time, Solorigate. So, technically, I’m not exaggerating. 
But here’s the twist. 2016, Facebook helps Russia hack the US election... cool. Nobody even knew. Cause they 
didn’t know, there’s no fuckin’ way it could happen again. At all. But then, it happened again after all. 
Why...? 

People making promises they can’t fuckin’ keep. That’s a lesson that continues to be repeated over and over 
again, throughout history... some idiot provided false assurances, that never panned out. People were fooled 
again. Some idiot says nobody will ever be fooled again after THAT point. Amazingly, people got fooled again. 
Yeh. This is why it’s pretty important that people know when they are being lied to... because it could lead to 
them dying. (Check out “Room for one more”)

Then the January 6th, 2021 uprising, just an example.
Regardless, not a specific example now... but when people trust someone who’s talking out of their ass...? 
Then, they may all die. Why...? History repeats itself. "Those who do not remember (when a cocksucker lied to 
people sometimes in) the past, are condemned to repeat it." 

If George W. Bush wanted me to TRUST him, he wouldn’t be trying to read another speech in Shanksville, 
Pennsylvania on the 20th anniversary of 9/11. Because I don’t think that plane actually landed in Shanksville 
at all. Something did crash, but it wasn’t a fuckin’ plane. What he could do, is write my ass a letter. 
He’s got my fuckin’ address, I’m damn certain he’s read plenty of my material, he could totally fuckin’ 
clear the air, but he doesn’t feel like he fuckin’ has to. He’s right. He doesn’t. But there’s one thing that 
I know he DOES have to worry about... is if another former president determines that I am correct.
      
The way I see it is like this... someone killed a lot of people on September 11, 2001, and I think that 
Exxon Mobil, was involved. But, even if I had as much proof as Robert Korol, or Leeroy Hulsey, and etc. 
I know that none of that shit will change a god damn thing. I have a far better strategy. 

President Bush, can’t write like I can. Neither can anyone at Fox News. Not a single soul that I can think of, 
that can KEEP UP with how long I’ll just sit here, pounding away at the god damn keyboard. Not saying that 
other people can’t type faster than I can, or that I can make Tom Clancy’s best book look like a fuckin’ joke, 
that’d actually be... I believe, insane to make that claim. Tom Clancy has written a lot of really good books, 
he wouldn’t continue to be such a highly praised author if he didn’t.
      
...what I am saying is that I can write down my suspicions, and lock down channels to distribute this content. 
Then, record the censorship being performed in real time, then, other people can see it happening to me and then 
they will write a letter to their god damn congressman, saying this, that and the other thing, but they’ll 
realize that sending letters to congressmen is also a waste of time. 

Why...? Cause. They’re just as helpless as the rest of us. Not saying that they don’t try, but someone 
‘swapped out’ the entire government, and now it’s all for show. Hidden government behind the scenes, giving 
everybody a middle finger every day. Looks like a real government, acts like one too... but how come the `$30T 
keeps going up, and none of it is getting paid...? Well, it’s because the feds are really good at tricking people. 
They are so good at it that they can even trick themselves too.

The best way to deal with all these suspicions is to continue where JULIEN ASSANGE left off, and continue to 
increase the voltage. The intensity of what he was doing, needs to be multiplied by factors and magnitudes that 
cause people to be strongly alarmed by what they’re seeing. 

I’m pretty sure that whatever I write or distribute will get censored...

When I distribute letters or documents, and I get a letter from a superintendent that says “trespassing, etc”, 
THAT tells me that people don’t fuckin’ care about what I wrote or distributed.
Cause maybe they’re not INTELLIGENT ENOUGH to understand the content of what I’m distributing.
I think that’s the main reason. Would’ve thought that a superintendent of a school district...
...would’ve been intelligent enough to understand what I (wrote/distributed).

Then again, maybe he was making a point about something getting "authorization" before I just...
...haphazardly post letters pertaining to CENSORSHIP...
...since America is a free country and most people don’t think CENSORSHIP HAPPENS/EXISTS.

ESPECIALLY IF A GUY LIKE MARK ZUCKERBERG, THE OWNER OF FACEBOOK, IS ASKED A QUESTION BY CONGRESS...
"HEY, YOU GUYS AREN’T CENSORING PEOPLE ON YOUR PLATFORM OR ANYTHING, RIGHT...?"
and Mark says:
"NO WAY BRO. WE DON’T DO THAT SHIT, EVER."
Cause the guy from Congress isn’t asking that question cause he GIVES A SHIT...
He’s asking that question so that the TWO OF THEM CAUSE EVERYONE TO ASSUME THAT NEITHER ONE OF THEM 
WOULD LIE ABOUT THAT.

So you have to casually tape a bunch of documents around that say "Nah, here’s evidence that showcases
living proof of a billionaire lying to a congressman about censorship."

Oh wow. So, Americans will learn that they’re being lied to ALL THE TIME. (← CENSORSHIP)
Nah, yeah it definitely fuckin’ exists alright, let me tell ya.
I’m not saying people won’t get it... some of them probably will.
But the large majority of people will probably say to themselves...

Them : This guy is off the fuckin’ chain, man... 
       Look at him. 
       Look at what he’s writin’.
       Talkin’ about some made up program called Pegasus/Phantom...
       Buddy, if that shit existed, more people would know about it... Idiot.

^ Yeah, I think people actually have that conversation with themselves when they read some of my material. 

So, if I told them some dude named Sam, fuckin’ sent me an email that said "I’m gonna shoot up Shen tomorrow."
And then, I COPIED and PASTED the CONTENT of the EMAIL that I DIDN’T WRITE...
...printed it and taped it to every fuckin’ door...

Oh, SCSO will show up at my house and arrest me for trespassing.
Cool. They’ll ignore the content of the fuckin’ email, and tell me something like:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

SCSO : Buddy, if that kid goes and shoots and kills a bunch of people, you’re gonna be in a LOTTA trouble...
Me   : *chuckles* LOL. Oh really...?
SCSO : Yeah man, you can’t just go around, and WARN OTHER PEOPLE, like that. 
Me   : Oh yeah...?
SCSO : Yeah.
       If some kid named Sam sent you an email that said "HEY, GONNA SHOOT A BUNCH OF KIDS AT SCHOOL TOMORROW..."
       Oh well.
       What can anybody do about it, bro...?
       It’s against the law to WARN OTHER PEOPLE.
Me   : Well, why would that be against the law...?
SCSO : It just IS.
Me   : Hold up, have you ever heard of this thing called "The Constitution of the United States of America"...
      ...or like, the "Bill of Rights"
SCSO : Nah, what are those things...?
Me   : Well, they’re (2) very important documents that our country, like, runs off of...
SCSO : LOL. Documents...? That the country "runs off of"...?
       That’s fuckin’ psychotic, buddy... 
       You’re gonna have to put your hands behind your back, I gotta arrest you for sayin’ somethin like that.
Me   : Nah, you’re not gonna do that cause if you TRY to... 
       ...you’re gonna get yourself assaulted and placed under citizens’ arrest.
SCSO : That’s illegal.
Me   : Nah man, you need to know what those documents are and how the United States runs off of them.
       All you’re doin’ right now, is showing me that you need better training on how to do your job.
       Correctly.
       *pauses*
SCSO : *staring at me*
Me   : Where you SHOULD be, *right now*, is finding out who this Sam kid is, and where he CURRENTLY IS.
SCSO : Look buddy, all our hands are tied, we can’t just go haphazardly lookin’ for some kid named Sam.
Me   : I understand that your department has a lot of morons there.
       That’s why you just told me "all our hands are tied".
       What I just said, should be a PRIORITY... not like an OPTIONAL thing.
       PRIORITY means that it’s MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING YOU ARE CURRENTLY DOING...
       ...and it needs to be handled with the HIGHEST LEVEL OF URGENCY...
       ...so that another Uvalde doesn’t happen.
SCSO : ...Uvalde...? Texas...? Are you threatening me right now...?
Me   : NAH MAN. HOLY FUCK.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

^ That’s why SCSO will get BLINDSIDED by the notion that some kid named SAM, that SENT ME AN EMAIL...
...brought a gun to school, and just started blasting away... killing about 60 high school kids.

Based on what I KNOW ABOUT SCSO, I’ll get arrested for trying to WARN PEOPLE...
...and then CHARGED WITH THE SAME EXACT CRIMES THAT THE KID COMMITTED...
If it sounds fucked up...? Oh well.
That is the POINT of distributing this fuckin’ content.

In other words, I don’t think people are actually READING what I write or distribute.
Which means that they probably don’t even care if a school shooting is likely to happen.

I mean, it’s not like I have a fuckin’ clue if it would. Well, I sorta do have an INKLING, that if it’s
happening at other places all across the country, then it’s not an IMPOSSIBILITY that it’ll come here.

But I’m gonna get a letter saying "OoooOOoOhhhhhHHh don’t trespass bro. Alright...? 
SCSO *might* get in touch with ya."
Nah. They won’t.
Cause they know they have no legal ground/leg to stand on if I’m going around taping materials that 
contain CURSE WORDS, but the PRINCIPLE of the message is that I’m WARNING PEOPLE.

They sure as hell could send someone to arrest me for trespassing...
But, any judge who’s a fuckin’ judge with common sense, is going to understand that HE will have to 
draw a new line because the people that brought this "ARRAIGNMENT" before him, are fuckin’ morons.

If some kid goes to school and shoots 60 people at Shenendehowa...? Oh well. 
It’s not like anyone gives a shit about	that AHEAD of time... right? (← MANIPULATIVE STATEMENT)

Nah I get the feeling that somebody got all the context of everything I’ve been writing,
and doesn’t know how to deal with me.

Everyone that saw it probably read 2 words that I wrote, and then threw it in the trash. 
Cause if they read it, and understood it, they’d talk to each other about it, right? (← dude in the ghost car    
traveling around at light speed, causing people to not give a shit)

JULIEN ASSANGE distributed a video of the US military killing innocent people. 
OBVIOUSLY, a bunch of MORONS think he DESERVES to be in prison for that, right? 
Wrong. 

When someone actually invests some thought into how fucked up that is, they stop sticking up for Hillary 
pretty quickly. Cause at that point it’s like... man. What if the other people that wanted JULIEN ASSANGE 
in prison, they like... go missing...? 

And, anyone that classified that video. 
Because General McKenzie will have to say:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

McKenzie : How come all these fuckin’ videos keep popping up...? 
           You keep like, killing innocent people.
           You’re starting to make us look like Russia? 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
           
He’s gonna get pissed if ANYBODY does that. 
I want to give this guy the benefit of a doubt, and assume that he wasn’t involved in that "accidental"
dozen deaths back in 2007 in New Baghdad, Iraq. Cause he was obviously stationed/dispatched there.	
Suppose we were to draw up a PARALLEL, and instantiate a scenario where someone wanted to FRAME someone,
so that THEY go to prison for 175 years, right alongside JULIEN ASSANGE. Doesn’t matter if they did ANYTHING,
what matters is that people successfully made it APPEAR to be FACTUAL.

This process is called FRAMING.

Here’s a look at General McKenzie’s (resume/history)... it’s worth noting that he should be in the next 
Expendables movie with Sylvester Stallone.

He could in fact, find his way there, if someone FRAMED HIM. But, why would someone do such a thing? 
Dude spent 43 years being a role model commander in the United States Marine Corp. Not blowing sunshine 
up his ass either, but it’s a question that anybody should be asking…
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Taking Accountability",@"
This dude has integrity, he literally took accountability for the mistake AFTER the Kabul airport attack...
...and I think that if anyone’s gonna have the moral high ground, sensibility, and capability to DO something,
it might be this guy.

SOMEONE OBVIOUSLY FRAMED JULIEN ASSANGE TO GO TO PRISON FOR 175 YEARS.

McKenzie made it pretty clear, that the bombing of a car that was believed to contain a number of terrorists 
in Afghanistan after the airport was bombed... that an accident was made. 
[Which is a step in the right direction, actually*]. 
Actually, sounds exactly like something Teddy Roosevelt would do. Taking accountability for a mistake.

During the 2016 U.S. election campaign, WikiLeaks published confidential Democratic Party emails.
They were supposed to be protected and kept confidential, but, do our politicians ever blame themselves...? 
Nope. Not (1) bit, man. I’ve never seen a politician blame themselves. Usually they’ll fabricate something out
of thin air, and then frame someone else instead, so...

...rather than to prosecute the Democratic party members for being careless with their EMAIL SECURITY...? 
Blame someone ELSE instead, like JULIEN ASSANGE. NOT themselves, noooope.
They are special, royalty even. 
If Prince Andrew is seen sucking some other dudes’ dick...? 
Well, you aren’t allowed to call Prince Andrew gay at all, and you’re actually not even allowed to tell anybody.
Because you will go to prison for 175 years for doing that.

Classic, run-of-the-mill, lazy-people-in-the-government, response.
Who cares if they were ALL CRIMINALLY NEGLIGENT with their EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS... Ya know?
James Comey won’t give a shit.

They can literally send classified email with NO SECURITY whatsoever, so if someone ELSE stumbles across it...?
Well, obviously that person was the most highly skilled hacker that EVER LIVED, and so...
They will blame THAT person, for hacking their email server. 
I mean, seriously, who cares if that person committed that crime, or not...? 
Nobody. Not even that person that did it.

This is America, pal. This is the prime location on the planet where you can be friends with the right people,
and never ever face any consequences for any of your actions. Because, you can easily blame someone else, and
there are a lot of less important people than they are, that they can just randomly point at and manufacture 
evidence at any given moment.

That is LITERALLY how (careless/ignorant) SOME people in the US Gov’t are. 
That is how SCSO operates... It’s how the NYSP operates too. So does the FBI.
The people that are reading this and getting pretty fuckin’ pissed off at me...?
Don’t get mad at me for being accurate. I’m correct. They do this shit to people, and nobody can actually stop it.

Oh well, man. Someone really important just accused you of killing a dozen people in an air strike...
Now, you weren’t even near a control center, but that’s irrelevant. 
Someone important has evidence that they cobbled together in a moment’s notice, and now you’re goin’ to prison 
for 175 years. Nothing anybody can do 

This is a common theme in the US, some people in our GOVT don’t have to put ANY thought into ANYTHING NOR take   
accountability... because there are SO many other people to blame. America... home of a lot of careless morons

But, pissing off people in the military like a top-shelf commander such as General McKenzie... 
...probably isn’t the best strategy in the world.
Nah, that’s... 

...likely to cause SOME OF THEM, to feel like they have EVERY RIGHT to grab the nearest weapon...
...aim it at me, and fuckin’ kill me... 
"WHOOPS Killed a guy named Michael C. Cook on accident, my bad." (← SERVES THAT DUDE FOR RUNNIN’ HIS MOUTH)

To be fair, sometimes I wake up and hope that’s what happens, cause what the hell dude...
Seems like I’m damned if I do, or damned if I don’t.
Eventually I come to my senses, and hope that I don’t find myself becoming a victim...
AFTER I came back to my senses, it’ll be like 6 months later:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Marine : Oh, this fuckin’ dude said some shit like (YEARS/MONTHS) ago, huh...?
         WELL, fuckface...
         I’ll fuckin’ show this dude what’s up...
         Doesn’t even matter if he printed a RETRACTION or not, for being wrong...
         Asshole just went right ahead, and used his first amendment right to say stuff.
         NOW it’s 6 months later... 
         *chuckles* Heh. This dude won’t even know what hit him...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Yeah, people might feel differently at some later point in time, which is a concept that I’m certain
guys like General McKenzie understands from beginning to end.

However, if I write about it... other people are going to start to see a list of potential suspects.
Because guys like him know damn well, if they watch me...? 
Someone IS bound to kill me at some point... 

Cause, somebody already tried (a few times I might add), and it’s why I sorta lost my nerve.
Can’t ask the local sheriff cause he’s "unable to be reached for comment"
Can’t ask Trooper Borden cause he will lie to my face about Pegasus/Phantom.
Can’t ask my family, cause ... they think I’ve lost my mind.
Can’t ask friends, cause they too... think I’ve lost my mind.
Nobody lost their mind.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

May 26th, 2020... 1200AM, it’s the night I’m gonna remember until I kick the bucket.
I really, don’t understand why the government doesn’t just take a lighter, and burn the constitution.
Cause, it sure as hell strikes me, as relatively "non-existent".

Yeah my father thought I was a real defiant son of a bitch. 
So when he died, I lost the sense of knowing the weight of my words.

Yeah, sometimes I remember my kid would be on the verge of tears or just bawling his eyes out, 
and I’d crack a joke... and he was crying while trying not to laugh at the same time... 

I don’t know if that happens to other people, or not...
...but feeling like you can’t help but laugh...
...when you’re right smack dab in the middle of bawling your eyes out...
...it’s fuckin’ strange.

The question is, a dude like that is gonna come to his senses if he’s offended in the least.
That’s why he kicked ass, took names, kicked additional ass, took additional names...
...rinse, recycle, repeat, until he was promoted to the top-shelf general that he was...
...before he retired from CENTCOM in April 2022.
If I gotta come right out and say it... the man’s kicked a lot of asses and taken a shitload of names.	
If I tell people over and over that Bob Lutz shits his pants everyday...
...and did for 50 years at General Motors... 
General McKenzie is gonna have a real hard time not laughing about that. 

Especially if I keep describing how it happened. 
Not to mention, someone in the military abusing military (software/hardware/personnel), choosing to kill a 
citizen is an act of treason. Well, maybe HE knows the official term for it cause I’m not sure what the specific 
term is. Regardless, insults from some fuckface like me are not gonna cause a patriot like him, to do such a thing.

I’m sure some of the rhetoric causes someone to guess what the strategy really is. So, there is that. 
Maybe that doesn’t matter. 
Cause, maybe *everybody* commits treason.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Marine : Everybody commits treason, Michael.
         You’re not that special, dude.
Me     : Oh yeah...?
Marine : Yeah, it’s what everybody does every morning, bro.
Me     : Really...?
Marine : Yeh, they get outta bed...
         ...take a piss...
         ...look at their watch...
         ...hit up Facebook...
         ...pour themselves some coffee...
         ...look at a newspaper...
         ...commit treason real quick...
         ...eat breakfast...
         ...and then they just, take off.
Me     : So, everybody’s a treasonist, is what you’re sayin’...?
Marine : Right. I mean, just havin’ this conversation is an act of treason, practically.
         *pinches top of nose* Everybody does it, bro.
         Just, move on with your life, already.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

So, I’m a fuckin’ idiot to even say it...
Nah, I’m just illustrating a point here. 
Certain people ARE committing treason, and ALREADY HAVE...

What that means is the government is able to kill its own citizens if it chooses to, and then classify 
or redact that. Then nobody will know it was REAL treason, nah. Can’t charge people with treason if it 
was classified... 

So, tit for tat between suspected treasonists committing censorship against people like me...
All while I write these stories about Bob Lutz sitting in his favorite chair. 
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Skit [~] Bob Lutz : Show us mortals how to run a car company",@"
Sometimes he would grab some saran wrap right before he shit his pants in his favorite chair, 
stick it under his ass... cause then it wouldn’t seep out of his underwear. 

To him, that’s what he lived for at GM. 
Wasn’t for building decent automobiles or parts for those automobiles... Nah. 

"Fuck that." is what Bob said about making quality parts and cars... 
...and holding it till he got to the bathroom. 

Bob is gonna fuckin’ hate my guts at some point because people at GM are going to realize that I’m 100% 
correct, Bob taught some of them how to swim through oceans of red tape... and always smelled like he shit 
his pants.
      
Bob can’t classify or redact the number of shitty vehicles he was involved in fabricating. 
They’re all quite shy of what anyone could really call a dependable vehicle.
Even the Cadillac CTS-V’s, or the Chevy (Stingray/Corvette)’s... they all (leak/burn) oil.

Some guys like my buddy Doug Bagely will tell me: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Doug: Oh yeah, I have this fuckin’ Allison transmission in MY truck...
      Fuckin’, best transmission money can buy.
      Unstoppable.
      Invincible.	  

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

...then the transmission that he kept workin’ on basically fails one night between Inoli, NY and Johnstown, NY. 
Fuck. It’s still a very good transmission. Just needs to have a thing in it replaced, then it’ll work again. 

Yeah, you can’t design a transmission to always work, cause with enough wear and tear, it’ll break.
But- there’s a reason why it’s a pain in the ass to work on these fuckin’ things.
Cause, you might wind up having to get underneath the fuckin’ truck, after buying like `$200 worth of fluid,
sensors, filters, to SEE if maybe all that will get the truck MOVING again...

...but nah. It’s not gonna shift into 3rd gear anymore.
That’s cause Bob Lutz fuckin’ had something to do with that, bro.
Not even remotely fuckin’ kidding.

One after another, shitty vehicles were made with a lot of thought put into them, no doubt... 
but literally every time they were designing these cars and engines, Bob would randomly show up...

Bob would stand there, looking at the engineering blueprints, and the drawings on the whiteboard.
He’d stare at the whiteboard for a moment.

Bob       : Is that so...?
Engineer2 : Yeah man, each week, *waving hand around* you come in here...? 
            And you just, pretend like you own the place or somethin’... 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
            
That pissed Bob off, because, that guy was right.
Bob didn’t own the place at all. 
He just ran shit. 
Whether it was down his leg...? 
Or all over the company...? 
The man knew how to run some shit, alright.

Still, he had a habit of always wanting to know what the hell was going on a little too late.
So, he spun it around.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Bob       : Listen fuckface, you wanna run this company...? 
            Hm...?
Engineer1 : *kept his mouth shut*
Bob       : Alright. 
            That’s what I thought.
            Listen. 
            I want you guys, to put a god damn groove, right here *drags a pencil down on the blueprint*
Engineer1 : Well, that’ll probably cause some damage after a while...
Bob       : Oh yeah buddy...? 
            I’ll fuckin’ damage YOU in a minute, if you don’t do what I tell ya. 
            Ya hear me...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

So, that’s what they actually did. 
The company immediately started making more money for some reason... they didn’t understand it. 
Bob could draw a line anywhere...? 
...somehow, the company made more money.

After a while, the engineers started asking Bob for his input a lot more often. 
Bob would come in, and just draw a line anywhere he fuckin’ felt like.
The engineers were actually surprised that the cars they kept building lasted as long as they did. 
They all thought for sure that people would die in them, or there would be recalls all the time... 
...or even that ALL OF THEIR VEHICLES WOULD BURN/LEAK OIL...
Luckily, Bob had a knack for drawing a fuckin’ line anywhere...
...and NOT cause critical damage to the manufacturing process.

To this very day, they all know that’s how shit went down for years.
Because whether it was drawing a random line, or runnin’ shit at GM...? 
No one could stop this guy.

It was no secret to anybody at General Motors headquarters, Bob came in...
...they ALL heard gurgling noises whenever he stood around long enough.
He’d try to distract people so that they couldn’t really hear them...
...Bob had some sort of indigestion problem or something, and was too proud to see an actual doctor.

Like clockwork, every day, "Ah fuck. Not again." 
The pained look on everybody’s faces, "Sir did you-"
Bob ALWAYS got pissed off if somebody started asking him the most obvious question... 
He would always snap back "You better not fuckin’ finish that god damn sentence... I swear..." 
They would put their hands up and be like "Ok. Sorry..."
Once he waddled far enough away, they really couldn’t contain the laughter. 
He would get pissed off, but if he was far enough away, what the fuck can he really do about it...? 
Bob’s waddling back to his office... 
      
He started bringing extra clothes with him to work. 
He really couldn’t stand for this shit anymore, but couldn’t do anything about it either.
That really isn’t that funny, CEO of General Motors was able to make short work of many of his competitors...
...but his recurring 1045AM nightmare, made short work of HIM every day.
Determined to find some way around it, he had a routine he worked at for a long time.
Once 1045AM came around, he shit his pants again, right on schedule.
      
He was able to waddle back to his office, clean himself up, and then... 
...he didn’t fuck around for the rest of the day.
He might’ve fucked around for a fair amount of time before 1045AM, but AFTER 1045? 
He’d clean himself up, and get back on his fuckin’ horse.
He could handle the rest of the day just fine.
Cause when it came to building a lot of quality vehicles...? Nobody knew how to stop this fuckin’ dude. 
They were the best low quality vehicles money could buy... 
...and this dude smacked a grand slam every fuckin’ day because of it.

He eventually had a shower installed in his office... 
People would walk in his office... 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Them : Dude, why does it always smells like shit in here?
Bob  : Eh... my toilet doesn’t fuckin’ work...
Them : I can... call maintenance and get that fixed for ya...?
Bob  : Nah, nah... it’s alright I’ll handle it.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

But then Bob "forgot" to call maintenance because truth be told...
...he was too embarrassed to carry so many soiled pairs of pants outside. 
Any self-respecting person in the world, wouldn’t be caught dead carrying THAT many pairs of shit soiled pants... 

Look, I shouldn’t give Bob Lutz such a difficult time, the man did make plenty of awesome vehicles.
Probably waiting for me to throw another insult, but nah... he made SOME good vehicles after all. 
The Pontiac Firebird/Chevy Camero were awesome cars. So was the GTO. So was the Cadillac CTS-V. 
The problem is that, all of the ICE vehicles GM makes, they ALL burn and/or leak oil.

The reason for that is because they were built with intentional design flaws.
Because this dude would show up when the engineers were building the god damn parts, and just draw a fuckin’ 
line in the middle of the blueprints. Whether people find that difficult to believe... it is more than just 
HIGHLY fuckin’ likely. But, telling other people better be a damn good story, or else.... 

Might be a total waste of effort.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Monarchy",@"
The way I see it is like this, I can see clear as fucking day, that someone successfully converted America, 
back into a monarchy, like, England. This time around, it wasn’t some bullshit tea that Britain was forcing
the people in America to pay for, now it’s shitty vehicles that break a lot. Or, medicines that are dangerous 
and have deadly side effects and eventually cause cancer, OR, narcotics that people get addicted to, and 
can’t get off of without some maintenance medication. Or, sometimes it’s just a president being a lying sack 
of shit that violates everyone’s rights, and would prefer not to tell anybody... 

So, the rights that are granted in the Constitution of the United States of America, NOW they take a back seat. 
Or, people had better hope that I’m fuckin’ wrong... People will IMMEDIATELY assume that I am wrong, UNLESS I...

convince them of my many arguments. Most people will say "Who the fuck is Edward Snowden?"

Edward Snowden was the guy that leaked a bunch of this stuff called:
"evidence of the government doing some incredibly questionable shit..." 
...and then president Obama labeled that dude as a (traitor/spy).
    
Doesn’t make much sense really, because if Congress AGREES that the documents in the Snowden leak revealed 
some incredibly questionable shit, AND that shit was unconstitutional, that means that anyone that supported 
so many of the things he highlighted... could very well be charged with crimes... Pretty sure that includes 
GWB and Michael Hayden, among others. That is of course, IF everybody collectively gives a flying fuck.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Excerpt [~] Communist outpost in the heart of a ‘democracy’",@"
The problem is, I think that the part of America that USED to have integrity, died on September 11, 2001, 
in Washington DC, and Manhattan. I am MOST POSITIVE, that BARACK OBAMA IS NOT THE GUY that I should be MAD at,
because Edward Snowden hasn’t been given a trial. 

The Department of Homeland Security, will not allow that to happen if he comes back, so, he is still not 
allowed back into the country. Cause, the ONLY person, that happens to be the MOST IMPORTANT GUY... 
...that EVERYBODY should be upset with, is George W. Bush.

DHS basically does the same thing to GWB that Hannity does to Murdock, from what I can tell. 
GWB might say “Nah, they don’t.” But, he’s lied before...
    
Snowden was attempting to tell people that there’s something SERIOUSLY fucking wrong, with the direction 
that the country is being pulled into. Why...? George W. Bush established or extended and enhanced the 
Department of Homeland Security, I don’t know what their actual purpose is, other than to be a constant 
fuckin’ question mark. Their existence looks like a communist outpost in the heart of a ‘democracy’. 
"If you SEE something, say something." 

Well, ok. I’m fuckin’ sayin’ something over and over again, but I think some morons can’t fuckin’ read.
That’s what I actually think. I don’t think people can read. 
They can for a fair amount, but then, talking about what they read...?

It’s too hard because a lot of people are still plugged into society, they think: 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
| commercials are cool | Murdock would never force Hannity to suck his dick | Lutz didn’t shit his pants at GM |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
But, commercials are meant to program people into buying some shit, even if you don’t buy whatever it is.
Murdock probably doesn’t FORCE Hannity to suck his dick at all, since he does it WILLINGLY.
Bob Lutz prioritized making huge profits off of vehicles designed to last (5) years or less...
...over NOT having a serial, every-day, episode of pooping in his pants.

Early on, like 3.5 years ago (October 2018-ish), someone was interacting with my documents when I would write 
them. If I tell other people about that, they might get offended by the notion that I know something they think 
is impossible.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Them : Dude, you sound intelligent, but that shit you just said is impossible.
Me   : Well, it isn’t impossible at all.
Them : Oh yeah, well...
       ...what makes YOU so special, huh?
Me   : I’m very intelligent. 
       My vocabulary is quite extensive. 
       I can easily confuse people with what I write...
       ...without even TRYING to do that.
Them : Everybody can do that though...
Me   : Definitely not. 
       Keep tellin’ yourself that.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

It’s because people grade me based on my appearance, they don’t grade me based on how I sound, or like, 
how intelligent my father was... They either TRY to confuse things I say INTENTIONALLY, OR, they don’t try 
at all... they just hear me speak something and they’re immediately confused. (← Not always the case, sometimes
people will change their attitude completely if I make a RARE/COMPELLING argument)

Some people don’t get it. Smart people get it. The regular, every-day person, WILL have trouble understanding
ME, or my RHETORIC... because I pepper in a lot of REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY. 

People judge how intelligent I must be, based on my APPEARANCE... not by how sophisticated I sound when I 
talk. I really don’t care if I offend people when they start to insult my intelligence, because I’m literally
redirecting the insult back AT them. A lot of times, people don’t realize that they started that shit...

It’s gotta be something strange like that, because when I DO have conversations with people and I say stuff, 
they want to talk about the latest episode of the Real World on MTV or some shit. So, I just get bored of 
talking to people... Why...? I really don’t care if Dave got down on one knee for the fifth time in the last
2 weeks, proposing to Mandy “Babe, will you marry me...?” Cause, the dude obviously didn’t understand the 
word “NO” like 4 times beforehand. Maybe if he asks a FIFTH time, the fifth time will be the charm.

In other words, I think I can apply my intelligence and concentration toward more complex, difficult, or
challenging goals. Trying to come up with a strategy to get JULIEN ASSANGE released from prison, and 
Ed Snowden a ticket home... seems like a challenge that few people are daring enough to take on.

They wanna talk about stuff I don’t really care about, because it’s not that important.
What they’re trying to talk to me about, isn’t anything more than a thing that changes from moment to 
moment in coolness. The things I’d RATHER talk about, are threats to national security, life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness in a country that’s SUPPOSEDLY free.

So like, whatever the hell is on Netflix, not important.
Some video game, not important. 
All of those things that people go out and watch or do, they are made for CONSUMERS.
CONSUMERS are very different than CREATORS.
CREATORS, vary from skilled to not skilled at all.

They also range from SOPHISTICATED to someone taking a shit in a box...
...and calling that an iPhone 13 for `$1500, to simple things, such as this document.

I realize, this document is FAR from SIMPLE... but the challenge isn’t to pound a bunch of keys and come up 
with a magic passphrase or hash token. The challenge is SHAPING the ideas into a format that’s more consumable,
and easier for OTHERS to care about.

That’s fuckin’ difficult, let me tell ya... 
Instructional design, politics, psychology, engineering, mathematics, history, all the subjects are at the top. 

Some things, are pretty complicated, and complicated causes confusion.
Whereas, someone may make something rather simple, and it becomes a way of life.
These smartphones, they’re very distracting, and, they’re rather susceptible/prone to espionage and identity 
theft. The manufacturers play the same game that the National Institute of Standards and Technology played 
way back in 2001...

What I do like to discuss, examine, or talk about...?
    
World Trade Center, steel beams. 2800 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Jet fuel. 
1800 degrees Fahrenheit. 
1000 degrees somehow unaccounted for. 
Reason, thermite. 
Why? Robert Korol. 
Who is he? Fuckin’ smart bastard. 
Why is he a smart bastard...? Built buildings. Engineered buildings. Demolished buildings. 
If there’s a single guy in the fuckin world that people should take seriously, about anything related to 9/11,
it’s this fuckin’ guy right here.

Dude kept trying to say somebody had some jizz-on-the-chin, and nobody wanted to say who that was.
Korol never said anybody had some jizz-on-the-chin, it’s just a colorful metaphor. 
A visually stunning, white, sticky, gooey metaphor...
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Colorful Metaphors (1)",@"
Many of the girls I went to school with, even some of the teachers at Shenendehowa Central School district... 
...they might’ve had SOME jizz-on-the-chin here or there...
...but not nearly as much as the President of the United States, George W. Bush...
...or Shayam Sundar, director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology...
...BOTH did, after publishing the NIST 9/11 report.

Cause if I try to tell SOME of these females that they had a lil’ smidge of jizz-on-the-chin...?
It’s not the end of the world, really. Because, that was to be somewhat expected.
Especially if they’re wicked hot too.

Me   : They probably aren’t.

       ...doesn’t make any fuckin’ sense...

Girl : I wouldn’t like to see jizz on some dude’s face, either...
Me   : I’m not saying that gay dudes can’t be doin that.
Girl : Obviously, I’m not sayin’ that either...

       Pennsylvania didn’t even leave fuselage...

       not even knowing whether the jizz is even REAL or FAKE...
Me   : Well, who knows why they do what they do...?
Girl : I mean, if a guy’s gonna wind up havin’ jizz on his face, that’s pretty gross...
       ...but, at least have the common decency, for it to be REAL jizz. 
       Not FAKE jizz. 
  Fuckin’ weirdos...
Me   : Can’t believe we’re talking about jizz, whether it’s REAL or FAKE. 
       This conversation is pretty nutty...

The point is, even those girls will wonder why George W. Bush would even allow himself to APPEAR, as if he had 
a huge fuckin’ wad hangin’ right off his face. Had they known, what I knew, about crunching numbers like 2800, 
and 1800, somehow seeing a visual indication where 1000 was still floating around... THAT, was the very REAL
jizz-on-the-chin phenomenon for Shayam Sundar, and George W. Bush. Robert Korol fuckin’ saw this shit too.

He didn’t say it like that, because I’ve determined that in order to get people to READ the god damn story, 
it has to be entertaining to some degree, so, it can’t actually have ALL facts in it. It’s gotta have some 
story elements. It’s gotta come off like i’m not just a fuckin’ smartass, but also a comedian.
One that happens to eloquently write like I’m weaving in and out of bounds.
 
First, I’m within bounds, nothing offensive, no bad words... 
    ...expertly crafted vocabulary, chiseled with a fuckin’ diamond...

Then, I’m out of bounds, I’m totally talking some shit, telling someone that gets paid to be an expert... 
   ...that they sorta suck ass, and show em why... 

Then, I’m back within bounds, realizing I made a grown man cry, apologizing...
   ...telling him that I didn’t realize how insensitive I was being...

Then, out of bounds again... just kiddin’ fuckface, you got paid some fat stacks...
   ...but it was never for any skills you had, now fuck off.

For instance, some girl I went to high school with, sucking my dick at school, and how her head went up 
and down. That’s cause she was ALLOWING something to keep going back and forth, in and out of her mouth. 
Same exact concept of how I have to blend my research, with compelling story elements.

I will compile a story that has plenty of facts in it...
But then I get the feeling that people are gonna cross their arms, and be skeptical...
...unless I convey a little bit of my personality... 
...since many people have a hard time being unique.

Some people might be impressed and say "Wish I had MY dick sucked at school..." 
Or, "Wish I could write like this guy..."

But it just takes practice, and being able to discern fact from fiction.
When the government spins fiction as fact...? 
It makes itself liable or susceptible to the ol’ ‘jizz-on-the-chin’ phenomenon.
And from what I’ve seen, they don’t like it when someone calls them out in an all too effective way.
Might even look ‘accidental’...

The truth is, this dude was a real smart bastard. He just kept getting the correct answers by ‘accident’.

The jizzlings on multiple chins, are gonna be pretty fuckin’ obvious.

If that sounds a little over the top...? 
Well, good. I’m glad that my vocabulary caused somebody to feel something similar to how I felt...
...being 17 years old, asking myself questions. I would think “This doesn’t make any fuckin’ sense, dude...”

None of the other people at my school SEEMED to have this mentality…
Not a single fuckin’ one of em. 
Maybe there were, I don’t know. 
But, I have to assume nobody thinks that.

Why...? 
Cause if the popular kids at school scoffed at an idea that required too much thought...?
They’re gonna think "That can’t be true. If it was, then somebody COOL would think that, too."

Little do people ever realize when they’re that young, popular things are often not very sophisticated at all.
Sometimes, they’re even incorrect.
Having the mentality where you’ll ask questions that no one else asks, means you have to think outside the box.
    
So many people think: Popularity determines accuracy. (← FALLACY)
It means, somebody used an incomplete circle of logic, and they sound like they’ve got a dick in their mouth.
PHALLUS  → latin word for penis
FALLACY  → sounds almost identical (phonetically), and means the logic is incomplete
FELLATIO → blowjob
FELLATE  → providing a blowjob
FALSE    → incorrect

The words have a lot of similarities for a reason.... somebody has a dick in their mouth, SOMEHOW.
Having incomplete logic like Dwayne Coonradt, or the police sometimes... 
...means that they’re COOL with appearing as if they have a dick IN their mouth.
    
Usually if you SAY “looks/sounds like you have a dick in your mouth”, they’re not gonna AGREE.
Obviously. Nobody is gonna openly AGREE “Yeah, I might have one in there... let me pull it out.”

The ones that put some thought into stuff...? 
They’re not even gonna ALLOW themselves, to even APPEAR as if there COULD be a dick in their mouth at all.
But, that requires EFFORT sometimes.

Metaphors are thing that... GWB sorta sucks at understanding. 
That’s why he can’t write a good fuckin’ speech if his god damn life depended on it.
It’s not necessarily even what he may have written, or what someone else wrote FOR him...
...as much as how he fuckin’ sounds...
Cause if he decided to go out on stage and say: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

GWB : Listen, ya fucks... 
      I’m not playin’ any fuckin’ games today.
      I am the law.
      You’re all gonna be fuckin’ impressed no matter WHAT I say, and that’s that.
      *dramatic pause*
      Anybody have any questions...?
      *a bunch of people start asking questions*
      Alright everybody, gotta go.
      Mission accomplished, the end. *gives everybody peace signs*

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

...I would actually be HIGHLY impressed with that.
First president in history to come right out and call everybody a bunch of fucks, say he ain’t playin’ no games,
he IS the law, and that they’re gonna be fuckin’ impressed no matter what.
THEN, the dude said “Anybody have any questions...?” 
THEN, a bunch of people started CLAMMORING to get their questions in... and the dude just said “Gotta go.”
(^ Very impressive.)

Doesn’t mean he doesn’t try, it means that those buildings, as well as WTC 7, were destroyed through a 
process called CONTROLLED DEMOLITION. 

That’s the point where any thought of these guys NOT having any jizz-on-the-chin, became a total 
impossibility... and from that moment forward...? I’ve been left with a question that never gets an answer.

So, there it was. 
Just two fuckin’ dudes, standing right next to each other, arms crossed, looking down at the camera.
Nobody will ever know if they blew each other, or if fuckin’...*trailing off* I don’t really want to 
ask myself questions about what they did. 

All I know is, when Shayam Sundar signed off on "diesel fires caused WTC 7 to collapse"... then, 
how come NO OTHER BUILDINGS experienced that as well? 

The answer is that the Department of Homeland Security was instructed to totally miss that shit.

Every time I say this, I get the feeling that people really don’t pay any attention to it. 
They may actually be hyper-attentive and aware of it, but they’re tiptoeing around like James Bond...
...when really, they should be taking some lessons from (Tom Cruise/Ethan Hunt).

Perhaps most people will ignore it.
If they don’t, then they may immediately ask somebody who doesn’t CARE...
...if they sound like they may have a dick in their mouth...
...after they try to read it, and get confused.

They may get confused by looking at 2800, and 1800, and say "This dude’s GOTTA be insane..."        (← FALLACY ALERT)
Cause that’s what people will say when they’re confused, and they just read something that they don’t understand...
Even if they DO understand, they MIGHT state something that’s not very well thought out.

In a rare condition where a rhombus has (4) corners that are all 90 degrees, a rhombus is ALSO a square.
But, ONLY in that (1) single, rare, non-repeatable condition... 
...will someone actually agree with me, AND, find what I wrote PLAUSIBLE, AND COMPELLING.

Then again, maybe more people agree with me, than I think.
Maybe they too, agree, and I’m the asshole for thinking that it’s gotta be rare cause no one ever says it
out loud... I don’t know.

Look, I constantly expect somebody from England is gonna read everything I wrote, and then say something
along the lines of “There’s no way that dude is correct. That means he’s insane.” (← 2x FALLACY ALERT)

If people read it at all, and they want to sound intelligent to somebody like myself, when they get down 
to the part where I say 2800°F, 1800°F, and 1000°F unaccounted for... 
They SHOULD say "That is actually very fucking alarming...", because then that person will <earn my respect>.

Because, what if people just started saying that (2 + 2 = 5)... not 4.
Then, 2 + 2 = 5 became a smash hit that everybody thought was correct.
So if I say "No, 2 + 2 = 4", somebody will try to tell me that’s just my “opinion”.
Heh. I’m not even fucking kidding, people actually think like this.

Not specifically (2 + 2 = 5), but if GWB and the news never said a single thing about how WTC 1,2,7 
ACTUALLY fell, they would realize that they were lied to. Officially. Then a war was fought. One where 
a lot of people died. And that it happened for `$`$`$`$`$.

That equation, doesn’t FEEL right to a lot of people, because that would mean they have been living a lie 
for about 20 years. No shit. But, it probably is too accurate. Now climate change has caused irreversible 
damage to the planet. They all took part.
    
At that point, if those (3) numbers, (2800, 1800, 1000) I just wrote about don’t set off any sirens in 
their minds... that’s just basic math that people can’t do while reading.

They can say whatever they want to, but if they can’t fuckin’ do math when they read, and give up before 
they read it all, and call me nuts... their opinion isn’t very educated, is it?

This is actually how a lot of guys from SCSO sound when they talk too. They don’t care if they’re wrong. 
They will say they make an "educated guess" when they are taking a total shot in the fucking dark.
It’s not an educated guess at all, when they do that.

In other words, I should probably start doing a hidden camera show where I leave these documents somewhere, 
and wait for that person to start reading it... Cause I’m certain that what’s happening, is people are 
saying "WOW WHAT A WHACK JOB", because they don’t know how to do research. 

I’m not gonna keep saying these things and insulting people that don’t deserve to be insulted, if I know 
that they’re not ignoring what I’m writing, and just jumping to the conclusion that a president would NEVER 
EVER LIE TO PEOPLE... because that’s moronic.

matters. That means they can lie about whatever they feel like, any time they want to, and even go so far as to
KILL people, and nobody will ever know, or even care. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Body_Count)

Louis CK, didn’t fuckin’ lie. He gets paid to make people laugh their asses off, but the dude told the truth 
about masturbating in front of a couple female comedians. Oh well. They probably should’ve communicated the
truth about how they felt, when he was like “Hey, you two mind if I just *pointing thumb*... crank’ on my pud?”

Cause hey, maybe the guy was about to release his movie ‘I Love You, Daddy’... 
So, the (2) female comedians who weren’t offended enough to (file charges/make accusations) BEFOREHAND...
Ah, they had a prime opportunity to REALLY fuck this dude over…

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\
  
Female1 : Dude’s releasing a movie called ‘I Love You, Daddy’...? 
          Nuh-uh, I don’t think so.
Female2 : Yeah, a few YEARS ago, this dude LITERALLY asked us if it was OK to start crankin’ on his pud... 
          ...and when we said SURE, then he did.
          What the actual fuck, dude...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Whether it was a few DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS, or YEARS, is not something I’m privy to. But, I do know that they 
WAITED to say anything to people about it. How COOL is that...? Dude is probably a far better comedian than 
either one of em. I gotta say, whether they were using REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY, or being SARCASTIC/FACETIOUS...?

At least the man owned up to it, and wasn’t trying to BURY it like the people in the box up above would. 
Did he die when he admitted it...? Nope. “Oh well guys, I’m a guy, I have a dick. So what...?” -Louis CK
(^ Dude didn’t die at all, by being honest)

I’m not gonna continue with how the comedian somehow bests all of these people by admitting the truth.
But just know that Louis CK probably has more power than any of these fuckin’ people. 
Why...? The man can make people fuckin’ laugh. Maybe I shouldn’t flaunt it about for the world...
...maybe some of them can make people laugh, too.
      
If some of em don’t know how to get their dick sucked by some girl at school, that’s ok.
I’m not gonna get on Andy Cuomo’s case for not getting’ his knob cobbed on when he was in school, or the
NY governor’s mansion, off of Eagle Street, in Albany NY 12203.

At least Matt Lauer, Bill O’Reilly, James Comey, and OJ Simpson, probably know how to get THEIR knob cobbed on.
Gonna throw Louis CK in that list too. All of em, probably know the ins and outs, of how to get some action.
But- not Andrew Cuomo. Ooooohhh no. It’s why he’s not the GOVERNOR anymore.
I’m gonna leave that subject now.

Much of my understanding around the destruction of the twin towers and WTC 7 stems from what I’ve read over

Whether it’s Architects & Engineers, like Robert Korol, or Leeroy Hulsey, Xili Quan, or Feng Ziao...

In other words, you can make the best cake that anyone ever made in the history of people that ever lived on

“Woe to You Oh Earth and Sea…
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath, because he knows the time is short
Let him who have understanding reckon, the number of the beast…
For it is a human number…
Its number…? Is six hundred and sixty six.” –Number of the Beast/Iron Maiden

People who will literally kill innocent people and then classify a video... like ‘Collateral Murder’, and 
that’s why JULIEN ASSANGE is in prison. Maybe I’m quoting the wrong Iron Maiden song and I should’ve selected
“Hallowed be thy name”, which is an epic tale about INJUSTICE.
    
Regardless, when people classify a video or blacklist doctors or scientists, they’ll make the effort to call ME a 
nut job... cause I’m just saying all this stuff. But, I’m not the one classifying the videos where innocent people 
get killed. Am I? Nah. I’m not. So in the end, who’s really the fuckin’ nut job here…? <The people in denial are>.
    
I’m absolutely certain of it... large phallic shaped objects, making it very far into their asshole...
...while they call ME the asshole, then, pulling that fuckin’ thing out.
Shovin’ it all the way back in...?
Back out.
In again...? 
And then, once it is sittin’ pretty, all the way in...? 
Right back out.

Almost in a VERY PREDICTABLE MANNER…

Over and over, you would think that they could get enough of this...? 
But, so long as they call ME the nut job, they’re gonna be fillin’ that asshole over and over.
    
And, that’s why this is America.
People in my own family that might be calling me a ‘nut job’…? 
They probably do this too. (← Why PRINCIPLE OVER PERSONALITY > OPERATING ON YOUR ASSUMPTIONS)

I can’t tell certain people that the National Security Agency had many of my phone conversations tapped.
But, they have. If it WASN’T the NSA, then it was somebody a lot worse.
    
They really should stop and ask themselves why, and find a fuckin’ way to communicate that they know...
...rather than for me or them to make assumptions.
I could imagine that HAD my father survived the night he was killed, 10/23/95...
...that he could’ve told everybody that he knew he was about to be killed, but then he survived after all...
...his family and everyone he knows would’ve said:
"You’re fuckin’ delusional dude, nobody was trying to kill you at all."
    
Weird. The NSA wasn’t tapping me at all, were they? (Somebody definitely was.)
Facebook/Google/CIA wasn’t intercepting everything I posted to the platform, and preventing other people from 
seeing it, were they? Well, I have videos of that happening. The police like Trooper Borden, he must’ve been 
correct that there’s no program that allows people to see everything people do on their phone, huh?
    
Well, think again fuckfaces. 
When my father decided to shove his fuckin’ foot to the floor of that cab, it’s cause he knew what the fuck 
was goin’ on. And, that’s when Zontell Gordon killed him... Why...? Pretty sure his death was a lot more than
just a foiled robbery. I’m fairly certain he was executed in a hit.
    
So, if I translate that to how I was almost killed by a couple dudes who were using an advanced tool called…
…PHANTOM/PEGASUS, people will say stuff that causes me to think I have to start insulting people. 

Because I know what I saw, and I get the sense that nobody actually gives a shit, if it’s true or not. 
Or whether the twin towers were demolished by treasonists… I mean, c’mon… who cares if that happened?
    
I’ll tell ya. A lot of people fuckin’ care alright, AND, Al Gore probably cares the MOST... 
...cause he spent like, 20 fuckin’ years telling people that we’re driving straight into a brick wall...
...in a piece of shit vehicle that Bob Lutz drew a fuckin’ line through somewhere...
...that vehicle being called ‘climate change’.
    
Amazingly, the adverse effect of the collapse of the towers was to tell the constitution to fuck off...
...and then control people with technology.
    
Advancements in technology have made so many things in life a LOT more convenient. 
Now the police, or feds or whoever really... if they really want ya...? 
They can start listening to you specifically, without a warrant. 
    
Someone will tell me "oOOohhhH that’s a violation of the constitution, they can’t do that..."
That’s how I know people aren’t even able to read my content, because I’ve been saying that.
People will get argumentative with me, not realizing that the police WILL violate the Constitution, 
CONSTANTLY- if they CAN’T get caught, they will fuckin’ do that.
    
It’s as if the Constitution doesn’t exist anymore, and people just treat me like I’m babbling about 
fuckin’ nonsense. Listening to someone on their device without a warrant, is a violation of the fourth 
amendment of the Constitution...
...but they sure as fuck do it anyway.
    
I know that someone will say "No they don’t."
Yes they do. I had an interview on the news with (Andrew Banas about SmartTV’s - https://youtu.be/bPdWt7kcd3M)
"Weeping Angel/Willow" is a tool that the Central Intelligence Agency made that the hackers were using to 
exploit and eavesdrop on people’s SmartTVs. I have referred to Weeping Angel a number of times already as 
Weeping Willow, and I’m just gonna keep using that terminology because it has an ALLITERATIVE RING to it.
Weird. Almost like I know what the hell I’m talking about.
No actual warrant required to use something like that, believe it or not.
    
I can PROVE that, if you like...?
Not one person ever asks me to do that, and the reason why... is because people make too many assumptions.
Everyone makes many assumptions.
Even the police. Many, many assumptions, confusing assumptions they make with "educated guess".
    
I write all this cause there’s no use in talking to people. 
I come off as an ALARMIST, ECCENTRIC, or even ARGUMENTATIVE, rather than THOUGHT PROVOKING.
Doesn’t mean I don’t try sometimes.

However, these are NOT things I would really talk about in a normal conversation with people...
...so when people see me or read what I write...
...they don’t know that I’ve devoted the last 4 years to studying these things...
...because they’re more important than running a computer shop.
    
Someone used some very advanced cyberattacks to relinquish my clientele and my relationship with my previous 
employer, because they like the idea of 1) filling their asshole with a cucumber-sized dildo, and 2) killing 
people like me for FUN.

People will think that the police really give a flying fuck about drug dealers when they occasionally have a 
story in the news about some of them getting busted... but, they really don’t give a shit about some single 
drug dealer, because they’re literally everywhere. 
    
People having their 4th amendment rights violated, sounds like it would be a newsworthy story...
It is. That’s why they all keep it off of the media and news. Sometimes, they are allowed to run a story 
about it. Key word being ‘allowed’.
    
That’s how these people have an argument with me "OoOoOhHh, if they enabled GPS trackers n shit, then they’d 
be able to arrest everybody..." They won’t. The reason is simply because, too many people like Trooper Borden, 
exist. They will lie to my face, call the Federal Counter-Terrorism Agency, ask them if a program like Pegasus
exists, lie, and then that’s how the entire conversation goes.

Meanwhile, the factoid that Deputy Pirrone was stalking/following me that day, flew over everyone’s fuckin’ 
head. Then I walked up to his ass after I spoke to Julie, dropping off the Samsung Galaxy S9+, and said 
"Are you following me...?" That dude WAS following me... because I wrote something that upset this cocksucker 
and left it with Oliver Robinson. Not to mention, the reason I dropped that shit off was because I didn’t feel 
safe going to the police. What a coincidence, I was being tailed by jizz-on-the-chin Deputy Pirrone~!

The reason why Brownell Clayton was trying to stop me in front of Walmart on 06/17/20, is because...
...someone told him that I was at the Catricala Funeral Home that day. 
Cause like, Eric Catricala has been abusing his position/authority to try and get me in trouble SOMEHOW.
Typically, people shouldn’t call the police an INSTRUCT THE POLICE to do something that contradicts witness
testimony, and somehow makes a lot of people question why I left evidence at a bunch of places...

Well the reason is pretty fuckin’ simple... it’s because some people tried to kill me MULTIPLE TIMES, and so
they were trying to have the POLICE finish the job OR, some ulterior motive or objective, where it’s just as 
BAD, as getting killed. For instance, having CPS write a letter of indication, and having Sheriffs conjure up
false details on records, or just simply having DEPUTY COOPER show up and say “NFRASTRUCTURE NOT INVOLVED”…

So, I kept leaving letters with Mr. Robinson, because... again, I was asking for fucking help from SOMEBODY 
and I don’t feel safe asking the police anymore. But what does everybody do...? Oh. Call the police. Cool. 
That’s a smart idea. It’s such a smart idea to call the police if the COMMAND IS COMPROMISED, and sorta HAD 
SOME INVOLVEMENT IN TRYING TO KILL ME ALREADY. COOL. AWESOME. THUMBS UP EVERYBODY… 
That is why I call people MORONS. I’m not running from the police, I didn’t do anything illegal.
They’re trying to get me in trouble and smear my character to COVER UP THE DIRTY SHIT SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING.

I would have thought Oliver Robinson, being a superintendent of a school, was intelligent enough to read 
what I had to write, but I don’t know. I know the dude is... but, there’s an additional issue.

Getting feedback is pretty important, because now I have to worry about so many people failing to give that 
feedback, and assume that they’ve expedited an insanity aspect. 

Can’t be insane at all, if I know that’s what they’re saying or doing... right? 
Well, maybe when I stare at the screen and type up all this stuff, maybe I’m deluding myself when I write it 
as well as I do. Then, when I tell people “I never ever use something like Grammarly, because I like to write 
my own shit”... that confuses people. They wish they would write their own shit that doesn’t bore people to 
sleep I’d bet.

I am certain people assume that, so that’s why I will insult some people.
You don’t want to praise people that don’t bother to say anything, so if they don’t, insult them instead.
They don’t have any intention of getting back to you in either case.
It’s better than assaulting people.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Who do they go after? (1)",@"
Here’s the bottom line. 
They will not waste their effort going after a drug dealer unless they are REALLY starting to piss them off. 
Unless the dealer was someone really important like Richard "Dick Tackler" Sackler. 
Then they’ll be very sad that their child died from Mr. Sackler’s fine medicine.

Aw. They can’t get pissed about that, because of how important he is. 
Sorry to make a dramatic point here, cause I don’t think anybody really deserves to die from a drug overdose, 
nor a sick fuck at a supermarket, or at a concert in Reno, or Dayton OH, or El Paso, or Dallas, or wherever.
    
I will say those things, however... and people will still think I’m worse than they are.
Never shot or killed anybody, but people treat me like I HAD to have...
I’m constantly assessing how other people will feel when they read my writing. 
But when I try to EXPLAIN to people WHY someone does that shit...? 
I deduce that people don’t listen to me...
...because they don’t actually CARE if they get shot to death by some random crazy person who lost their mind.

Reading that sentence again, they probably do care about that.
I’m sure they do after it actually HAPPENS... but before that happens, they don’t.
That leads to situations where someone would rather be killed unexpectedly by some random person...
...versus listen to me and explain how or why people do that.

The truth is, society as a whole, doesn’t care. Even when another shooting incident occurs, people don’t care.
They continue not caring, more incidents occur, because society does not care.
Why does society not care, Michael? Is a question anybody COULD ask me... but they don’t.

Why? They don’t give a shit. They all seem to think that it all comes down to the individual, but the problem 
is MUCH LARGER than that. Every single person has their own choices in life to make. When people continually 
make shitty choices and lie to people or remain indifferent, it causes someone else to have to make up for 
that indifference. So if Mark Zuckerberg wants to be a rich bastard and not hire as many people, it’ll directly 
affect people to the point where Frances Haugen has to fuckin’ say something.

Same exact scenario, now include the things that they talk about in the documentary “The Social Effect”.
Wow. What are they all trying to say...? The computers are basically rotting people’s brains because some 
people are greedy, and others can’t self-moderate themselves, and what happens is that greed eventually 
causes someone to lose their fuckin’ cool, and go on a fucking rampage. 

Once you throw in a cocktail of guns, medicine, and people not paying attention to the warning signs...? 
Oh. The USA-PATRIOT Act is actually CAUSING people to act this way.

It’s domestic terrorism, the designed to protect Americans from (cyber/bio/terrorism), isn’t doin’ that.
Well, it probably is doing that to some extent I don’t mean to downplay it’s intent. 
But- it seems apparent to me that it is definitely being abused, AND...?
...it’s just SHIFTED where the terrorism comes from, now it’s brewing up internally.
    
It’s a fuckin’ sick statement to make that people don’t care, but I’m not the sick person for making the statement.
They care alright, but not until it personally affects them, it would seem.

Me...? Trying to tell people how to stop that shit from happening. 
Them...? Giving me a middle finger, telling me to fuck off, then being amazed or shocked when another 
incident occurs. Not giving a shit till it’s too late.
    
When people watch the news, they’re getting a summary of stuff. Concision. 
They’re being told a number of reasons in rapid succession...
But they’re not making an effort to understand or change HOW that shit continues to occur.
Pretty sure I just explained it, perfectly.

People keep blaming individuals, and while the individual IS a problem, the problem is LARGER than that.
The problem is the society as well.

Society has so many issues and problems, that it just... shakes their head and walks away.
The problem is STILL THERE though.

Just because everybody walked away or moved somewhere else, doesn’t change the fact that the problem...
...has not been resolved at all...
...and it may very well move back next door to people after they make a lot of effort to get away from it.

THEY were sick individuals, and nobody really saw the warning signs BEFORE they made that decision... 
Not just because there are a lot of people like Trooper Carter or Trooper Borden, who don’t pay attention...
But also because PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY DISTRACTED. That’s why. 

Look, sometimes making a statement that could be considered incredibly rude...?
...fact of the matter is, being rude might cause them to snap out of the funk...
...and absorb what’s happening in front of them.

So when I’m writing about some of this stuff... some asshole keeps putting me into a category I don’t belong in.
Does the reason WHY, matter...? 
Or, is there some other issue where I just easily piss people off with my rhetoric...?

I think the problem is that maybe I have worked my ass off at a long list of places, doing various things, and 
each time that I think I’ve finally gotten my big break...? Someone decides to take all of my hard work away.

So, instead of just trying to start from scratch all over again...? 
I’ve decided that I’m just gonna piss these people off even more, because they seem to think that I’m a product.

Like, Lincoln Six Echo, and I’m just NOT ALLOWED to have dreams about a kick ass boat named “Renavatio”.
Nah. I’m apparently a product that had dreams and memories implanted in me, and so… there’s nothing I can do.

Cause, I’m literally a piece of property, and that’s that, man.
Of course, I’m being facetious. 
They’ve sent me on so many wild goose chases, that I have determined that what I do best, or enjoy doing the most…
…is writing stuff like this book.

Look, if I spend all day saying that I’m the most intelligent son of a bitch that ever walked the face of the 
fuckin’ planet, they’re gonna keep saying “Nah, bro.” but, QUIETLY… 
I’m fairly certain they think that they are. 
But, every time they think to talk to me, I will prove that I’ve gotten their full interest. 
As far as I can tell, I don’t believe I did anything ILLEGAL to wind up in this position.

So, what the hell am I doing that’s so interesting…? 
Is it that I write good material…? 
Am I an advanced persistent threat…?
Do I happen to look like I could just, go on a fuckin’ rampage at any given moment…? 
Does it seem like I would do such a thing if someone performs an UNLAWFUL STARING CONTEST with me…?
Is an UNLAWFUL STARING CONTEST even a real violation anywhere on the planet…?
Are there still some unclaimed gray M&M’s out there in the wild…?

Look, questions, the truth is, who the hell knows what…?
Am I a lot smarter than they are, and they just want to study or examine me for some specific reason…?
Does George W. Bush think I’m a fuckin’ cocksucker in return…? 
Or, does he want me to stop bashing him cause, the man has done plenty of things to deserve some respect…?

Well, I’ll tell ya… 
Whatever the case may be, it’s not anybody’s fault that I started pissing people off on accident, and recorded 
a video of (2) dipshits that were right in the middle of trying to kill me using a dangerous weapon called
PEGASUS/PHANTOM.

The government has gone way too far to be considered calm, collected, and gracefully executing a flawless 
exhibition. Yeah, I don’t mean to bash everybody in the government, or the military, or the police, or justice
system… but some people are REALLY drinkin’ the fuckin’ Kool-Aid, man.       (← Metaphor for people being brain dead)

Some people were fed lead when they were kids, and ate paint chips and had brain damage. 
Me...? I’ve no doubt that perhaps I have some brain damage or something...
Maybe it’s such a severe case, that I just don’t ask for handouts from the state like everybody else does…
…regardless of the fact that I know plenty of money gets spent on keeping tabs on me, specifically…?

Truth be told, I’m not quite sure what the hell these people want to SEE or HEAR, before they back off and 
allow me to go right back to what I was already doing, unless of course, my performance or accuracy was just
consistently causing certain people to victimize me.

I’m still calm and collected and happen to have a pretty thorough understanding... 
...somehow I get shoved into a category I’m not a part of.
At this point, I’m making a god damn show out of this.

They incorrectly allocate me to some place that I have no business being in. 
If they did that to ME, then they’ve done it to others too…
So, maybe I’ll start the (CCTF/Cybercommando Coalition Task Force), and we’ll be basically a combination of…
- a constitutional militia…
- dudes that joke around while also kicking everybody’s ass at every game we play…
- a force for the free press
- one of the most fearsome groups of badasses that commit DEFENSIVE and OFFENSIVE cyberwarfare 
  AT or ABOUT the level of the Central Intelligence Agency…

Or better yet, maybe it’s time to talk about the (IC3/Internet & Computer Crime Cybercommando Task Force). 
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Skit [~] IC3/Internet & Computer Crime Cybercommando Task Force",@"
That isn’t the real name for this band of misfits that are essentially an entire division of the (Federal) 
Bureau of Investigation. I’ve been writing a number of stories about so many other government agencies…? Heh.

I haven’t even spoken about these guys because they are relatively silent, and quite methodical about kicking 
the shit out of identity theft and cybercrime.

These guys… heh. They have probably been watching me to see if I have what it takes, to sit at their table.

Suit and tie.
Leather shoes.
Shaved and clean cut.
But at a moment’s notice…?
Still ready to roll up their sleeves, get their hands dirty… 
…and kick the shit out of identity theft and cybercrime.

Heh. If you thought that these guys didn’t exist…? Well, they do. 
They’re the closest thing you can get, to an actual, honest to God, portion of the government that basically 
consists of men and women with such a high amount of moral strength and resolve…? 
…that they call themselves freemasons.

Sometimes they work a full 60 hours straight to stay ahead of the bad guys… sometimes even longer.
These guys know experts in the field, like Jim Browning, on a first name basis…

Jim : Hey, this is Jim Browning, I’m a security expert who engineers my own software. 
      I basically kick the shit out of scam centers and fraud artists, like I was BORN for it.
IC3 : Ohhhh, we know Jim. 
      You call us quite often and try to tell us your introduction… 
      …word about you has gotten around, Jim.
Jim : Oh it has, has it…?
IC3 : It has.
Jim : Well, alright then.
IC3 : You’ve earned our respect, for sure. 
      Our table will always have a seat for ya if you wanna come on a ride along with US.
Jim : Alright, I’ll pass on the ride along for now.
      I just wanted to make sure your agency has some advanced knowledge of an impending attack that will be 
      coordinated by the Russians, Chinese, and India.
IC3 : Well, shit Jim. 
      That sounds like some rather bad news… 
      BUT- they’re gonna find out the hard way that we’ve got this shit on lockdown, bro.
Jim : …what do you mean…?
IC3 : This guy, Michael Cook… 
      Secure Digits Plus LLC out of New York. 
      He gave us some advanced clues and tips… 
      …he somehow managed to stumble across the same exact group...
      …that we've been investigating for a very long time… 
      …based in Albany and Saratoga county in New York. 
      This dude doesn’t play games, either. 
      Basically a one man wrecking crew…
Jim : Well, holy shit, dude. 
      I’m impressed. 
      What does he do…?
IC3 : Well Jim… this dude kicks ass, and takes names. 
      Sometimes he doesn’t even take names, frees him up to kick slightly more ass.
Jim : This dude sounds like he is gonna be eaten alive by that crowd of dirty cops in New York.
IC3 : We’re aware of this. 
      He is essentially operating as an undercover agent. 
      We can’t elaborate on the specifics… but this kid was born for this shit. 
      Kid studied Cisco, Microsoft, CompTIA, had his own website on PLANETQUAKE… 
      …this kid is the one we’ve been waiting for…
Jim : I feel like we’re getting a little carried away here…
IC3 : *scoffs* Carried away, Jim…?
      *Long sigh* Haven’t even told you what’s on his resume yet …
Jim : Alright, well, before you start describing him even more… 
      …does he have any specific experience with these call centers and threat actors…?
IC3 : *crosses arms* Well, Jim… it just so happens to be the case, that this kid has basically ripped right 
      through a SLEW of theories that we ALSO had, and this dude was in fact directly targeted by… 
      …Advanced Persistent Threat 29, AKA Cozy Bear.
Jim : *nervous gulp* …that probably almost killed him…
IC3 : Apparently, they DID almost kill him. 
      And you would not believe how many rare elements to this kids story there truly are…
Jim : How RARE are we talking here …?
IC3 : Ohhhh, well… this kids father was killed in 1995 and his father studied physics, programming, processor a 
      architecture, networking, and dabbled with BASIC, Primos, and Spice.
Jim : Jeez…
IC3 : Kids father happened to be associated with the Pickett brothers…
Jim : NFRASTRUCTURE…?
IC3 : …that’s right.
Jim : I am… actually rather fascinated with this story…
IC3 : Look, we took note of the things he’s been doing all along the way.
      He studied under a networking and system administration ninja who goes by the name of David Patzarian… 
      …he offered the kid a scholarship and he turned it down, because… he’s intense like that.
Jim : Jeez, what about college…?
IC3 : Yep. 
      ITT Technical Institute, studied under a few clerics, one of them named Mr. Elberfeld…
Jim : Did you just say, Mr. Elberfeld…?
IC3 : *nods* Damn straight I did…
Jim : Wow. I have heard a number of stories about Patzarian and Elberfeld…
IC3 : *chuckles* Jim, still haven’t even really gotten started…
Jim : Well, holy shit this dude sounds pretty intense and over the top. 
      I literally called to talk about a coordinated attack that’s likely to be Solorigate 2.0.
IC3 : This kid literally said all the same things… he has some hunches that line right up with ours. 
      Somehow this kid, apparently has eyes on the back of his head, and psychic powers or some shit… 
      …he’s like a walking lie detector, dude.
Jim : Yeah…? 
      So, I’m assuming that he’s got certifications and experience …
IC3 : Damn straight he does… Dude knows how to fix a computer, network some equipment, terminate his own 
      Ethernet and fiber optic cables, configure switches routers and servers, surveillance cameras, dvrs/nvrs, 
      wireless access points and high performance workstation and desktop tuning. 
      Dude literally ran circles around an entire company of employees… 
      THEN, about 3.5 years ago, he started his own company to focus on application development, 
      virtualization… 
      …and my god… sayin that this fuckin dude has talent…?
Jim : …yeah…?
IC3 : …it is just very much an understatement. 
      *Shakes head* This dude, hasn’t made much fucking money over the last 3.5 years, but… 
      We think he did that shit intentionally…
Jim : …why would somebody do that INTENTIONALLY…?
IC3 : I think he was setting up a very complicated board of chess pieces arranged in the correct position… 
      …to take down some of the most elusive fucking cybercriminals on the face of the earth.
Jim : You’re talking about Cerberus, aren’t ya…?
IC3 : Yeah man. 
      This kid apparently knew that this immigrant from Russia/Ukraine, Pavel Zaichenko… 
      …was playing some fuckin’ funny business… 
      …we thought Pavel was working with the foreign intelligence service… 
      …and this kid literally caught onto it as we first started mapping out the group of suspects.
Jim : Cerberus is one of the most deadly gangs of cybercriminals in the world, they’re basically apex predators. 
      They only target rich bastards and financial institutions…
IC3 : The plot thickens, my friend. 
      Wanna know where this kid used to work…?
Jim : Where …?
IC3 : KeyCorp. 
      He had his hands dirty with level 1 help desk stuff… 
      …but this dude CLEARLY had a lot more experience and qualifications than that…
Jim : So, how does that play in to the overall narrative…?
IC3 : This kid has eagle eyed vision, apparently… 
      …he remembered an event where a global unique identifier failed to match up in the virus definitions 
      that System Center Configuration Manager CAUGHT, at KeyCorp in 2016.
Jim : OH WOW, THATS BAD…
IC3 : I agree, Jim. 
      But, you’re not gonna believe who this kid managed to impress the hell out of… 
      …when he started programming with PowerShell…?
Jim : …who…?
IC3 : *chuckles* A man named Michael T. Niehaus, from Microsoft.
Jim : I know who that is. He’s a legend. He made-
IC3 : Business Desktop Deployment, the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, and System Center Configuration Manager…
Jim : So, this kid literally went right to the top brass at Microsoft and impressed the daylights out of em, huh…?
IC3 : Heh. It’s almost like this kid kept ‘accidentally’ finding the most perfect way to make a name for himself… 
      …and a fair number of people got pretty fuckin’ jealous.
Jim : This guy would make a GREAT addition to the team man… especially if he knows all the stuff you said he does.
IC3 : Jim. 
      We have been watching this kid, because of how flat out impressed we are… 
      …at the size of this kids fuckin nutsack.
Jim : I’d be willing to bet that you’re not the only ones…
IC3 : Nah. 
      This kid is in WAY too fuckin deep on his own… 
      …he thought he was just gonna learn how to be a programmer real quick… nah man. 
      These people have fucked his entire life up, and he’s… 
      …literally been telling so many people the truth, and they all just ignore him.
Jim : Are you serious…?
IC3 : Absolutely serious. 
      This kid LITERALLY has a disabled iPhone 8+ that he used to manipulate these serial killers abusing PRISM…
      …AND PHANTOM… 
      …on fuckin video, dude. 
      And then the feds that WE were investigating…? 
      …they remotely disabled his device. 
      Literally committed destruction of evidence. 
      Some of us thought he was making this shit up… but we are all convinced. 
      He has been telling people the truth.
Jim : Who is this guy, former military…? CIA…? Black ops…?
IC3 : Nah. Just a dude with a lot of passion, persistence, and drive. 
      Even Daniel Pickett says that this kid is no fuckin joke…
Jim : This is… a little too surreal, dude.
IC3 : You’re telling me. 
      These dipshits committed MULTIPLE TELEPHONY DDOS ATTACKS, and MULTIPLE VEHICLES, and that whole entire time… 
      …the story just sounded a little too good to be true.
Jim : Yeah, I was gonna say that.
IC3 : Look Jim… this kid, has earned our respect… he’s also PISSED US OFF a number of times… 
      …but he admits when he is wrong, rather promptly…
Jim : Let’s reconvene here, how does this kid bear significant relevance to cozy bear or Cerberus…?
IC3 : Well, Pavel is a Russian spy. 
      His father was as well, once upon a time.
      They’re both involved with people that have killed a lot of people. 
      So are some people IN THIS KID’S FUCKIN FAMILY.
      They’re dangerous.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Who do they go after? (2)",@"
So, IC3 isn’t exactly the Internet & Computer Crime Cybercommando Task Force… 
…but with enough greasing of the wheels, maybe it COULD be.
The next best thing would be to enlist many of the people that work at IC3 that wanna get their hands dirty.

Hence, the Cybercommando Coalition Task Force is basically a lot of people’s worst nightmare.
I’ll seek out guys like Jesse “The Body” Ventura, who’s still quite a fearsome dude, former Navy SEAL, governor,
wrestler, and conspiracy theorist extraordinaire. Obviously I’ve taken some inspiration from his ideas, I used to 
watch his show, but- there were other elements that felt connected to me, and MAYBE, CVE-2019-8936 is the reason 
why I always felt as if, Russians might be doin’ some real shady shit they’re not supposed to be doing…

I’m sorta spitballing at this point, because frankly, I’m in this situation because I write a lot, apparently, in 
a country where there’s freedom of expression, you’re actually NOT ALLOWED to express yourself like I do, and that
means that I’m basically breaking the law every single time that I write something in the word editor.

I mean, maybe I am committing the Espionage Act of 1917, and ya know, never even needed to have any fuckin 
classified materials at all, to be handed such a strict sentence. 
When I write, I talk a lot, especially about guys such as SNOWDEN and ASSANGE. 
I know that what I write, paints a very clear picture that I’m actually annoying the fuck out of some very 
important people the more I write and talk about them both.

But- that’s perfectly legal for me to do. Ya know…? Who the fuck actually cares, if I’m upsetting someone in the 
government when I continue to write about getting EDWARD SNOWDEN a fair trial, and getting JULIEN ASSANGE out of 
his situation…? I know that there are people who care that I’m upsetting them, but it should be pretty fucking 
obvious, that I, personally, don’t fucking care.

I’m not a terrorist, nor am I an extremist, nor am I willing to do something that causes so many people pain…
…I’m literally pissing off some dudes in the government whose sole purpose in life is to be a dick faced
trollmeister… yeah. Doesn’t feel like a real great summary of what they have done, serving in the United States
 government, does it? Being a dick faced trollmeister extraordinaire, but- times 20.

If it’s not GWB that I’m pissing off or upsetting, it’s gotta be some dudes who wear the type of jeans you 
could buy at Aeropostale that have pre-worn in holes in them, because of how fuckin’ cool they looked back in 
the early 2000s. Maybe they wear a turtleneck sweater in the summertime just to be extra gay looking on top of 
how gay looking they already appear to be… and now…? 

They’re fuckin’ getting WICKED pissed, cause, I’m literally grasping at straws…
    
At least these dick faced trollmeisters and I seem to have SOME things in common.
I have SOME issues with managing my emotions, but that’s because sometimes I realize I’m saying words, but 
some people can’t understand what they mean, no matter how clearly I say them out loud, or whether I write 
them, or whether I record a brand new instance of (ARCHIMEDES - https://youtu.be/QP25FbNhakQ)

Look, the way I see it, I’m being watched cause a billionaire underestimated me, we’re the same age, I have 
a lot more talent, he has a lot more money, we’re basically tied because, he’s not really having anywhere 
remotely as much fun as I’m having… is he…? If I’m WRONG about that, then… why do I continue to ACCUMULATE 
additional exhibits that I’ll be able to use in a lawsuit…? Well, the reason is mainly because, I’m a serious
liability. So when I tell people that I’m worth millions of dollars…? It’s accurate.

The question remains, I mean… surely if a billionaire wanted me DEAD, I’d be DEAD by now, right…? 
Probably would’ve bit the dust outside of the Computer Answers shop back on 05/26/20 if the morons that they 
sent, weren’t so fuckin’ obvious… but that’s ok. They were pretty obvious, and I know that what I recorded 
on video, was SO FUCKING RARE, that someone disabled my iPhone 8+ remotely… and, man.

That means that I’m STILL a fuckin’ loose end.
Anyway, if they’re getting upset about how I keep describing what I merely ASSUME their sense of fashion MUST 
be, obviously they too, are gonna have difficulties managing THEIR emotions too, but in their case, wearing the
fuckin' factory ripped up jeans and gay lookin’ turtlenecks in the middle of the summer, there’s gotta be some
estrogen production goin’ on too. And you know what…? That’s ok. Sometimes people have an issue they can’t fix.

Some psychiatrist or psychologist will try to tell me that he’s studied every exam, and knows the DSM-V in and 
out, but I outsmart these people when they don’t care enough to talk to me. 
When they DO talk to me, they’ll hear what I said to Samuel Bastian.
    
Then, he’s the only person that ever cared to sit down, and listen to me.
Well, I know that plenty of other people listen to me too, but they don’t have a conversation with me where I can 
hear THEM… they can hear me just fine. They can use these fuckin’ Vault 7 tools and exploits and basically fiddle
around with the little strip of skin on their nutsack while they’re watching me pound away at the keyboard dumping
my train of thought… the end result is that they’re not having an actual conversation with me.

As for Mr. Bastian, I shared with HIM, maybe 0.01% of the things I think about…
I didn’t tell him that I ask myself some pretty bizarre questions when I’m in the mood to REALLY piss some 
people off.

For instance, 
- Has Mark Zuckerberg ALWAYS been pretty lame…?
- Does Mark occasionally have LAN parties with his friends…?
- Why does he call himself the Eye of Sauron…?
- Why do the employees call him that, instead of shill boy from Tanzania…?
- Does he fuckin swing from vine to vine like Tarzan, when he feels like going full out, beast mode…?
- Does he ever use CREATINE with his workout supplements, or is he more of a ‘shake-weight’ type of dude…?
- Is George W. Bush more of a shake-weight type of dude, OR, 
  does he wait to shake when he’s gotta take a fuckin leak…?

All of those questions are specifically meant to poke fun at these dudes who, ya know, if I mailed them a 
sincerely written letter that expressed how I actually felt to be star struck by their phenomenal performance…? 
Would they even bother to read it…? 
Or, would they ask themselves the billion-dollar question… 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Them : Is this some type of sick fuckin’ joke…? 
       I mean, he literally hand wrote 42 pages telling me how awesome I am...
       ...after all of the shit that we’ve had to go through to make his life a living hell…? 
       This is just… fucked up dude. 
       Cause, I would’ve never expected this son of a bitch to hand write 42 fuckin’ pages…

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

But, I don’t think I would ever write that many pages to either one of these guys, but for a GIRL that I really
wanted to bang the snot out of back in high school…? THEN, I might do something like that, to let her know she 
was still on my mind every once in a while. Cause she had an ass like an onion… made me WannaCry. 
(^ Why I’m a genius)

The reason why I would say “why I’m a genius” is because that’s a line that Hank Shraeder uses in Breaking Bad.
Hank was talking about the principal lady. 

But also, WannaCry is the name of the RANSOMWARE ATTACK THAT WAS USED AT MY OLD JOB. 
Not to mention, she DID have an ass like an onion... Made me wanna cry. COOL. 

That’s why I’m “layering” in, multiple jokes into a single fuckin’ cheesy pun… that bear relevance to this thing
called MY JOB. Cool, so I’m doing a lot more than just writing corny jokes and research, and pointing the finger 
at morons that have badges that can’t investigate a fuckin thing they’re told, like for instance, Michael Zurlo 
at the Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office, or even Trooper Borden at the Clifton Park Public Safety Building.

Regardless, Samuel Bastian was able to identify with much more certainty and thoroughness, that whatever I’m 
doing is apparently changing my level of intelligence, or perhaps just the way I present myself to people… 
...because, the last question that man asked me, was "Have you always sounded this intelligent...?" 

No. I mean, I USED to be a smart bastard in elementary school because my DAD actually HELPED ME with my HOMEWORK, 
and he was a much more involved parent than my mother, even before my father died. Once he did, however… 

I actually stopped caring about having straight A’s and being psyched about school, so… the fact of the matter 
is that I found a way to remember who I used to be as a kid before he passed away, so when I start to come off as
someone who sounds like a PROFESSOR…? That confuses people... 

Because, the people that have (supposedly) known me my whole life, they always took me for a quiet little slacker, 
and so (this person/these people) gradually puts me right back into a box that I don’t really belong in… because 
I was hiding within a shell I didn’t want to leave for a very long time. 

So when people say stuff like “Dude, you’re not that smart, you never have been…” I have to say stuff like…
“Sounds like something a moron would say.” Because I used to be pretty quick witted and fresh with people, and 
I stopped being so forthright. Sometimes I do feel bad for blowing a fuse and losing my cool/patience with 
people… but it takes some time for me to determine what I continue to consistently feel about something, versus 
the principle of the thing I lost my cool over.
    
Mr. Bastian earned my respect, and if it weren’t for people like him, or the woman Donna from Saratoga 
Hospital. I would feel like nobody fuckin’ cares. Cause Susan McDermott doesn’t. Neither did Dr. Loeber... 
they’re scam artists, the both of them. Both of these fuckfaces lied over and over, and injected falsehoods 
into an official document that they sent a lawyer. The police do that shit too.

But most people aren’t him, or that woman. 
More often than not, that woman Donna at the hospital, has no fuckin’ clue that her peers, commit medical 
fraud. And, that’s fine. 
    
For the large majority of people... 
They think that reading some of the shit I write, means I’m psychotic or something.
If I WAS psychotic, then... I wouldn’t be able to be reasoned with. 
Part of being considered a psychopath, is that, a psychopath cannot be reasoned with. 

So, if someone is labeled as a psychopath, but that person can be reasoned with after all...?
Then it looks like the person who mislabeled a psychopath incorrectly, has some jizz-on-the-chin.
There’s no other alternative. Someone who understands reason isn’t a psychopath, but-
...people are morons, and they assume that anyway...~!
     
This happens to the police, all the time actually.
Some of the police KNOW this, and they will actually just, blatantly lie to people and call it…
“The Police Blotter”. Not even remotely kidding, sometimes they will casually throw an innocent person
that did not commit a crime, into this god damn thing with charges and jail or prison time, and people
are cool with it.

If I don’t say stuff like "somebody must have the ol’ jizz-on-the-chin" I’m gonna remain pissed off.
Cause I don’t think it’s fair that George W. Bush APPEARS to have had some jizz on his face post 9/11...
They said they weren’t gay at all, but there’s a mans’ jizz on that dude’s chin.

Robert Korol fuckin’ knew that shit was there... he just wasn’t saying it in a way that caused people to 
give a shit. I gave a shit. Other people... didn’t. Maybe plenty of other people gave a shit, but it wasn’t 
like a collective...
    
The only time there just so happens to be, a fresh wad of jizz on some dude’s face... 
...is right after he sucked some other dudes’ dick...
...and then that dude busted a fuckin’ nut on his buddy’s chin.
A president isn’t gonna stand for a stain like that to be on his legacy...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

GWB:  I’m no fuckin’ jizz-on-the-chin son of a bitch.
Me:   Oh... Looked like it.
GWB:  Whatever dude. 
      I tried my best.
Me:   To cover up the demolition of a 3rd building...? 
GWB:  Yeah. 
Me:   What about the airline stewardess, Rebekah Roth... listening to those phone calls, over and over...
GWB:  Those planes were landed already kid. 
      They were all killed on the ground.
Me:   The F-16’s on the runway was all for show then, eh?
GWB:  Yep. 
Me:   The pentagon was hit by a-
GWB:  Cruise missile. 
      Not a plane. 
      Would’ve caused cars to roll over on the highway from the air resistance, had that been a plane. 
      People would’ve seen it.
      No fuselage found at the Pentagon.
      That was a fuckin’ missile alright.
      No plane crashed in Pennsylvania either.
      Shanksville was a distraction.
      So was Sarasota Elementary.
      I didn’t commit treason. 
      Something worse than that happened.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

And THAT is the conversation that’d cause me to trust former president George W. Bush.
Cause the theme is, “something worse happened”
The reason it’ll never fuckin’ HAPPEN, is cause there’s a good reason it hasn’t happened already.
Can’t really happen any other way, believe it or not. 

As for WHO DO THEY GO AFTER...? Well, people like ME, EDWARD SNOWDEN, JULIEN ASSANGE, JOURNALISTS, FREE 
SPEECH ADVOCATES, WHISTLEBLOWERS, et cetera. I have no fucking doubt in my mind, that they will ATTEMPT
to throw ESPIOPNAGE ACT of 1917 charges in my face at SOME POINT IN TIME… HOWEVER…?

If I just CASUALLY say something like that in this DOCUMENT, and the FILE DATE happens to be like, YEARS
BEFORE they decide to DO something that fuckin’ ridiculous…?

It’s gonna have the whole ‘jizz-on-the-chin’ aspect to it. Because, I’m just some fuckin’ loser that has
a really MINOR track record when compared to mobsters, gangsters, murderers, lifetime criminals…
…I’m just a guy that has had autism his whole life, and had his father killed as a child, who somehow had
an inkling that he was being watched and surveilled on, by foreign intelligence.

To the lesser dramatic stories, the same exact concept applies to someone putting an innocent person on a
watchlist. Whether I pissed off GWB, and he doesn’t wanna talk, or because some rich dude got offended by 
someone such as myself invoking my first amendment of the constitution... I know I’m there because reasons 
I cannot specify.

Make no mistake, it looks like someone was abusing something after all, and that even though I get mixed 
signals. Now, I know for CERTAIN that I’m on at least (1) list. Because of the shit that I’ve seen.
Sometimes mysterious things happen that I NEVER used to see BEFORE I started my company. 
There’s really nothing like making someone look like a total moron, who says I MUST be psychotic or 
delusional ...cause who the hell asks themselves THIS many questions?
    
Pretty sure that William Sidis did. Though, that dude was a lot smarter than I’ll ever be.
I still understand why he distanced himself from society... 
The dude probably thought it was best to stay away... 
...because, maybe some people can’t comprehend that the human condition is flawed.
    
I can still be reasoned with, but when I attempt to explain MY reasoning to people in real life...?
My reasoning cannot be conveyed in such a small window without thinking of metaphors or analogies.
If they were to put me on this damn list, and they see that I am able to be reasoned with... 
...doesn’t look like I am psychotic at all. 
Just pissed off cause people that care, they’re fuckin’ rare. 
    
Sometimes it even looks more like somebody with a real fat stack of cash, was thrown by RUPERT MURDOCK...
...causing someone to be injured because... that fuckin’ dude’s got a lot of cash. 
If he just wants to hurt somebody... he can do that shit with his cash.

Tape a bunch of it together, throw it at somebody... "See how you like that ya fuck~!"
Now they gotta get a cast. Neither the doctor, nor the police are gonna believe this shit...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Them   : Yeah, somebody threw a fuckin’ stack of cash at me...
Police : Bullshit, where is it?
Them   : I don’t know man, it knocked me unconscious...
Police : Well, how do you know it was a stack of cash...?
Them   : Cause someone told me...
Police : That’s hearsay. You don’t even know if it was a stack of cash or not, dude...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

No one will know if a brick of cash that RUPERT MURDOCK threw at some dude... is what knocked that dude 
unconscious. Rupert was like "Damn... didn’t mean THAT..." So he like, has his driver stop the car, gets out 
like the 3 stooges, picks it back up, gets back in the car, and says
"Alright, now get the hell outta here, I’ll have to try that again later...~!"
...the scene would look a hell of a lot like a scene on Louis CK’s show where some car stops...
...a few dudes get out...
...and they swap one homeless dude with another...
...and they just, get the fuck on outta there...

That’s probably gonna sound unlikely to a lot of people... Except him. He... he’s gonna probably laugh to 
himself. He won’t laugh about me breaking the news that Sean Hannity cobs on this dudes knob...  
That’s supposed to remain a secret. But, he might read about TUCKER CARLSON talking shit to Bob Lutz, about 
his golf game, and say “...that’s a little surreal..." 
Tucker too. He’ll probably say "this fuckin’ dude knows me a little too well. Wtf."

The Not News Network manufactures ways to manipulate people to into ignoring any alternative where people 
start to think "that makes perfect sense..." Stacks of cash being lobbed at innocent pedestrians, yeah, that 
is too difficult to believe. Nobody’s gonna throw a fuckin’ heavy ass brick of cash, not unless you’re the 
random person they managed to hit. That’s a rarity. 
    
If you’re somebody like me that finds poetic ways to unpack and examine why Sean Hannity sounds like a total 
moron when he talks, it could be for the same reason Ted Cruz puts himself through so much pain... That man,
experiencing a clobbering via Exxon Mobil’s penis.

That’s supposed to sound real gay, by the way.
Just in case somebody was like "that sounds gay..."
Yeah. It is supposed to sound that way. 
    
Look, if I don’t poke fun at these people... 
...the alternative happens to be shit like the kid that just shot a bunch of people in Buffalo.

None of those people deserved that. 
That kid, had some serious fuckin’ problems...
But here’s the thing that’s likely to AMAZE the largest skeptics...
My father was killed... 25 years ago... by (3) black kids. 
If anyone were the most likely to be racist at all...? 
Well, it stands to reason that I oughtta hate them more than him.
But, I don’t. 
Never ONCE have I ever thought to do what that fuckin’ kid did.
...and I doubt that he wrote anywhere even REMOTELY close to the content I write.

It is just, unfathomable to me, that anyone on the planet, has the ability... to write as much as I do.
I doubt he was anywhere remotely as skilled at writing as myself... but I haven’t read what he wrote.
Very few people are as skilled at writing as I am, at least it seems that way.
So when I write stuff, they are words that I wrote, and nothing more. 
But a kid like him, he will literally scope out the scene beforehand...? 
Select that area just because he wants to burn in hell for eternity, and then kill people with an actual real 
life gun.

They will not write really any of this stuff where it could be widely distributed and seen by people. 
Because, this son of a bitch actually proceeded to build a god damn plan. 
Dwayne Coonradt, literally told people that I am, exactly like this son of a bitch... 
I don’t doubt that for one fucking second, but that’s how much of a scumbag my old pal Dwayne actually is.

Cause let’s face it. He was lying to people, stealing shit, and showing me videos of people either 
1) getting killed, or 2) killing themselves.

This dude showed me a video of some kid jumping off of a fuckin’ tower, to his death... 
...and some people were recording that on video. Sickening.

He also showed me another video of some older man, being woken up, and then some kid slams down a fuckin’ 
heavy rake or some shit, seriously injured this dude on the FIRST swing, and on the SECOND swing, it went 
through his heart, and then that man was fucking instantly dead.

Yeah. If you’re like me, they’re actually gonna censor your ass, cause... 
I’m not uploading videos of people doin’ shit like that, but what the hell... 

Sometimes I don’t think they do that to violate my rights so much as they’re trying to prevent OTHER people, 
from realizing how fucked up the world is. But that stands to reason... who are they protecting?
I’ll ask that question again, who is it they’re protecting my limiting my freedom of expression or speech?

Well, if I can SEE a correlation to a COMMERCIAL PRODUCT, or SERVICE...
Then a corporation is overriding my rights.

What I mean is, if other people put as much thought into the ‘bigger picture’, they may actually lose their mind.
More people probably should, it’s probably natural for people to experience ways to deal with the impossible.
Like Noam Chomsky says, if people were bright at all, they’d stop filtering people that say controversial 
stuff, and just allow them more exposure. It’d have the reverse effect if they did that, but the fact that 
they tune the shit down, causes the INTENTION to be pretty fucking obvious after all.

Some people, do what Elon Musk does. 
The man will just destroy everybody that ever lived at whatever the fuck the man decides to do.
I have no doubt, if Elon Musk announced "I’m gonna build something better than the F-22..."
This son of a bitch will succeed at that.
I would imagine that throwing the words "son of a bitch" probably sounds offensive to some people, but nah. 
I’m literally complimenting this dude, and his mom isn’t a B a all. Mine fuckin’ sure as hell is... 
But his, appears to be a friggen saint.

That dude would build something like "the world’s first submarine rocket”. 
It was a submarine. Now it’s a rocket. Flyin’ all the way around the world in 5 minutes.
Probably for 1/10th of the cost of any competing plane manufacturer, Lockheed Martin’s gonna be WICKED pissed.
Could be built with a fighter jet package too.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Elon: You want the weapons package on this thing...?
Them: Yeh. 
      Obviously... 
      Wtf.
Elon: Alright. 
      You’re gonna be cool if we sell this thing to you, right...?
Them: Whaddya mean COOL...? 
Elon: You’re not gonna be another VLADIMIR PUTIN, right...?
Them: Nah, nah... 
      Not at all...
      (they’re Russian spies alright)
Elon: Alright, you gotta show proof of ID and a birth certificate.
Them: ...what???
Elon: Yeah, you can’t just buy something like this right here with the weapons package...
      ...without validating who you are. 
      You could be Russian spies that just lied...
Them: Yeah right bro... 
      I’m not cool with that at all.
Elon: Alright, business concluded. 
      Take care.
Them: WAIT... 
      Alright. 
      What the hell. 
      What’d you say?
Elon: ID. 
      Birth Certificate.
Them: What about an American Express card...?
Elon: Nah. 
      Doesn’t count, dude. 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Anyway, Elon would probably build something that kicks the shit out of the F-22, and Lockheed would not be cool 
with that cause then all of their contracts would dry up. The thing about the F-35, was that it was 
intentionally delayed and spread all throughout all 50 states, because it was a cash cow, and, it supported a 
lot of local economies. But, think about it. Someone thought it’d be a good idea, to like... waste a lot of 
people’s money... And then, they didn’t have anybody in Afghanistan when the `$1T worth of weapons, ammo, 
vehicles, tools, supplies, bombs, rockets, etc... fell into the hands of the Taliban. Freely donated. Cool.
    
Fuck you Donald Trump you dumbass son of a bitch. I don’t blame Biden one fuckin’ second for that.
Though some people probably think there could be no one else to blame... than Biden... 
I really do think that some people ignore shit like "Action causes Reaction"
"Cause → Effect". 
"Ted Cruz liking money → Getting his asshole stretched out by Exxon Mobil’s peepee"

Might sound a little immature of me, that I insulted some dude who’s a senator from Texas.
That dude, probably does not understand that I’ll roast somebody a lot more than Jon Oliver will.
Not saying that Jon Oliver is by any means necessary not doing plenty of that already...
I’m just sayin’, read this whole damn thing all over again. Then tell me... 
    
Exxon Mobil did more than just clobber Ted Cruz with their massive cash-penis...
...but I’m pretty sure they had something to do with the ‘diesel fires/thermite’...

In WTC 1, 2, and 7. I put ‘diesel fires’ in quotes cause I really think that only a moron would ever believe 
that shit. Not a genuine intelligent person, but someone that might believe anything people tell them.

Lining a building full of 1) thermite and 2) explosives, because they 3) had inside knowledge from the CIA, 
and 4) waited for Osama Bin Laden to have his buddies sacrifice themselves by flying into the towers that 
were already rigged, expecting that attack... I don’t really know if THOSE PLANES that hit the towers ... 
...had any people in them at all.
    
Yeh. REBEKA ROTH sorta had me on the edge of my fuckin’ seat with the way an actual expert that flies on 
airplanes, interpreted the call quality of those 911 calls. Pretty sure 0 people from Shenendehowa, have 
ever pieced this shit together like I have. 0. Just me. Only me.

The theme here, with this particular excerpt, “WHO DO THEY GO AFTER…?”
Truth tellers, people that tell: THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, and NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH… so help them god.
People that walk around living in a constant state of confession…?
Well, THOSE people REALLY piss off some people that have become rich, famous, or successful…
…for being a fuckin’ lyin’ sack of shit.

Yeah, so, there’s a war that occurs between morons who run away from the truth, (like Mark Zuckerberg)
and people who will express their train of thought on a constant basis (like me),
and the liars that could never fathom telling the truth that often, they will say/do some of the worst shit
in the world to the truth tellers, and man… they’re ruthless about it too.

The reason being, the liars quietly watch and listen and play with their dick all day in a bathtub while
watching, reading, or listening to someone like ME, because I happen to be VERY INTERESTING to them. 

Sometimes a guy like MARK, he’ll fuckin wanna give me a fist bump for telling it like it is…?
But- sometimes I really piss the dude off and he’ll actually be involved in the facilitation of murder.

Sometimes the police will do this too. They’ll laugh at my jokes, they’ll pretend they don’t know what’s 
going on, and they’ll even pretend as if they give a flying fuck about what the citation book says, OR the
bill of rights. 

The police have a LOT of people on staff, who do the exact OPPOSITE of LAW ENFORCEMENT.
But you have to consider using a DIFFERENT TERM FOR WHAT THEY DO… cause then it’s really called LAW AVOIDANCE.
In some cases, it’s literally BEING A (MAFIOSO/FRAMER).
That’s actually the reason why I keep saying that the police at the CLIFTON PARK PUBLIC SAFETY BUILDING…
…they’re dirty. Are they ALL dirty…? No, they’re not. I’ve written elsewhere in the material who’s clean.

Messines, Bosco, Ruffas, they are mafiosos and they are highly corrupt.

As for Shenendehowa, well… the 13 years I went there wasn’t ALL hell, but some people MADE it hell for me. 
Because they probably don’t care if our government committed treason that day.
I’m absolutely serious about that, if I tell them over and over, and then it becomes a national headline…
…they will hear about it and say “Yeah, fuckin’ Michael Cook kept saying that… Whatever dude. Don’t care.”

Cause most of those kids probably take people at their word. Why the hell not? It’s not like that’s hard to 
fuckin’ do. But, managing networks, programming, designing graphics, websites, print designs, business 
on-sites, outselling Dwayne every day, raid tanks, surveillance cameras, switches, routers etc. Nah, I think 
people can’t stand the fact that I may be a broke bastard, but that is ONLY because I piss people off.

Whether I’m TRYING to piss people off, or not…?
I will fuckin’ piss SOMEBODY off SOMEHOW…
Maybe it’ll be because of an UNLAWFUL STARING CONTEST, or maybe I just walk into work looking like I just 
woke up, and I’m on time for work… “Oh my god this fuckin’ dude, is on time for WORK… fuckin’ Christ.”

Yeah, I don’t really understand it. 
I think the reason people develop PREJUDICE toward me, is because I’m intelligent.
My mother constantly tells me that I should try to BE or SOUND, less intelligent than I am, and then maybe
things in my life will IMPROVE. But, THINK about how fuckin moronic that sounds… 

I’m not hyperbolizing that. My mother thinks that if I was so smart, I’d be rich by now…
…but becoming rich has very little to do with INTELLIGENCE.
It has a LOT more to do with OBEDIENCE, and doing what you’re told. 

Regardless, even though I can be OBEDIENT, I will STILL somehow manage to upset or offend somebody like
DWAYNE COONRADT, PAVEL ZAICHENKO, or maybe MATTHEW CALDWELL, or DANIEL PICKETT…
…because I will give every single one of them a run for their money with my work ethic and intelligence.
And they fuckin’ know it.
    
As for 9/11/2001, researching that someone in our government committed an act of treason that day…
...and none of those people care to understand how or why.

I would imagine, it’s because when someone important tells society that they didn’t fuckin’ do something...
...none of those people question it.
Maybe I’m wrong. Doesn’t feel like I am though, cause... 
...it feels a lot MORE like people dancing around the idea of having an actual conversation with me.

"Oh, fuck... there’s that guy who knows a lot of complicated shit... Fuck that dude, man."
I am certain that people have this line of reasoning, and I really could care less. 

Oh... some people might ask me "You don’t possibly expect me to believe that our own country would demolish 
those buildings, do you...?" 

Well, if someone is asking me that question FACETIOUSLY, then, no fuckface, because the sarcastic undertone
gave it all away as to how AUTHENTIC the fuckin question really was, because it was stated RHETORICALLY. 

So when I begin to explain why I gave them the answer they wanted to hear, I have to tell them that it doesn’t 
matter if they believe me. What matters, is if it makes perfect sense. 
The SARCASTIC/FACETIOUS undertone suggests that the person who asked that question asked it in a way where
they have ALREADY IDENTIFIED ANY RESPONSE I MAY STATE, as ridiculous, like, ahead of time.

Because, that indicates that someone is wasting my fucking time by asking that question.
My mother has done this shit to me my whole life, and it’s why I cannot stand how she applies no effort.

Generally speaking, people such as my mother, THEY think about IMMEDIATE consequences or implications.
They may have experienced BRAIN DAMAGE from LEAD POISONING back in the 60’s and 70’s when it used to be in 
the GASOLINE… so for THEM to think about things that are BIG PICTURE, or 10 steps ahead…?
They have a VERY DIFFICULT TIME thinking TWO steps ahead. So, TEN steps ahead…?

You might as well fuck off, cause… this person is gonna act a lot like a mentally challenged person who was
told a joke, and they need the punchline explained to them, and even if you do this, they STILL won’t get it.

That’s my mom for ya, and while I’m at it, might as well add my aunt Nancy to that list of people.

They’re gonna have a SUPER difficult time thinking about how Exxon Mobil could’ve manipulated this son of a 
bitch OSAMA BIN LADEN into waging that attack… ya know…? Cause, if I fuckin want something for free, why not
MANIPULATE somebody into doing something REALLY BAD, because… then people will join your cause and fight your
war for ya. 

These are things my uncle THOMAS would certainly understand, because he is ALSO a genius as is my cousin THOMAS.
They are both geniuses as well, but they have a different TYPE of intellect.
Exxon Mobil stood to gain BILLIONS → TRILLIONS of dollars, by invading the middle east.
In order to get everyone on board to allow us to perform DESERT STORM PART 2, we would need to have someone do
something SO FUCKING BAD, that it would have to be like destroying one of the wonders of the world.

The World Trade Center was designed from bottom to top, to be a piggy bank that America could smash, in the 
event that we needed to. So, suggesting that people were manipulating OSAMA BIN LADEN into doing what he did,
was like playing CHUTES AND LADDERS, and then KNOWING DAMN WELL, that if OSAMA BIN LADEN decided to attack, 
then you’ll be able to practically do 10 brilliant moves right after that.

Those “brilliant” moves were, converting America into a Surveillance Capitalism state, avoiding paying off the
US National Debt, invading Afghanistan and taking their poppy production, invading Iraq/Kuwait for its oil.

When I lay it all out like that…? Well, my mother will probably realize that her son was a genius and she just,
never bothered to listen or care about why I think the things that I do. My father sure as hell would have, as
he spent more time interacting with me, and teaching me right from wrong, telling me what to prioritize, and…
…the man actually helped me win my 4th grade science fair. I kid you not…? My dad actually cared about me a lot.

A lot more than anyone else in my entire life, I would go so far as to say. So, losing HIM, caused me to forget
what I wanted to be when I grew up, or what I wanted to do with my life, my aspirations, hopes, dreams…
…and so many people took advantage of that, and they continue to do this to this very day.

I might even be dealing with people that say “So what if they manipulated Osama Bin Laden into attacking us?” 
Well, anyone who legitimately has this line of reasoning should consider that what goes around, comes around. 

If that sounds too difficult to believe...? Sorry. Makes perfect sense to me.
These people that can abuse the 4th amendment, who supposedly they can’t do that cause the constitution...
...yada fuckin yada, they already had ThinThread in place. Pretty sure that neither 
1) public defenders I went to Kindergarten with, nor my 
2) cousin, or 
3) family members, none of those fucking people...
...know what ThinThread is, does, or how it was reverse engineered to monitor every citizen in the US.

It was already in place, collecting and screening ALL domestic communication data on a daily basis.
That means, JULIEN ASSANGE was correct about everything being tapped by the phone companies…
…however, the National Security Agency had implemented a SECURITY FEATURE, where anyone requesting data from
it needed to have what’s known as a “FISA WARRANT”.

Now they can just tell you or whoever else, to fuck off. No FISA WARRANT NECESSARY, because who cares…?
The Department of Justice doesn’t care. Neither does the FBI, or really any 3 letter agency.
Look, I am definitely glossing over the integrity that some people in these agencies may have…
It’s possible that they don’t perform LAW AVOIDANCE, and many of them DO perform LAW ENFORCEMENT.

It’s ALSO possible, that certain people still do this shit regardless of how offensive my generalizations are.
Otherwise…? Why would EDWARD SNOWDEN still be in Russia, and not like, attending a trial for the “crime” that
he ALLEGEDLY committed…? Well, it’s because the politics involved in that are a lot like how millions of people
will go out and vote for the next president, and the electoral college will give all of those people a middle
finger if they want a certain person to be president. 

Like, how Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000, and was at the hotel, waiting to give GWB a phone call regarding
which among them won the presidency. However…? Uh oh. Fuckin’ electoral college had to whip out the nunchakus,
and beat the fuck out of any reality whatsoever, that Al Gore would remain in the White House for (4) more years.

Only THIS time, in the ACTUAL presidential chair, not the vice presidential chair.
Al Gore had a fuckin’ phenomenal plan to COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE and GLOBAL WARMING, and nearly everybody wanted him 
to run the fuckin country, it’s… why he won the popular vote. Wanna know who DIDN’T…? Uh, the electoral college.

But also, our national debt situation seems to be accelerating and spiraling out of control.
I believe that there may be some association between “WERE IN A LOT OF DEBT” to “SILENCING TRUTH TELLERS”.
The association happens to be OIL CORPORATIONS, and GLOBAL WARMING.

As for people that COULD be supporting me, my voice or writing…?
I am given no support whatsoever, or if I am, it feels practically non-existent in an OFFICIAL capacity.
That’s how I know, that people probably don’t care 

I can’t say for certain that they know or don’t know how grave the situation is... but, when people DON’T 
say anything, that’s a dead give-away, that there’s quite a high likelihood they’re saying something that 
isn’t fuckin’ good at all. But if they hear something that some dirty cops cobbled together…?
They’ll sure as hell hear ALL about that ONE SIDED STORY they were lied to about, and that’s why I lose my
fuckin’ shit and get pissed off, and call people out. Because, suppose they gave me an opportunity to tell
them, that… I’ve been knowing what I’m talking about for a very long time. Why are people in my family 
doubting what I have to say…?

It is mainly because, society favors people like MARK ZUCKERBERG, who can lie every day of his life…
…and everyone believes what he has to say. He will flat out tell people, “I… really do not even have to try.”
Whereas society does NOT favor people like the TRUTH TELLERS, who tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help them god… because, once they hear that GOD is helping you tell the truth…? That’s when
SATAN has to say “Nuh-uh, bro. Fuck you, if GOD is helping YOU out…? I’m gonna fuckin’ make a LOT of people 
hate every single thing you fuckin’ say. Fuck you, dude.”

And that is exactly why the world is headed straight for an EXTINCTION LEVEL EVENT.
Unless of course, guys like Elon Musk manage to take control away from the morons.

Maybe I will stop calling SOME people out, at some point...? I really don’t know. 
Some people actually violate the Constitution that supposedly exists, like the police did to me on 06/28/22.

Then, when people say "that’s a violation of the Constitution, that’s illegal.” Right. It’s SUPPOSED to be. 
Key term there, being "SUPPOSED to be”. 
But also, assumptions being made by people that say "SUPPOSED to be" assuming that it doesn’t happen anyway, 
when it does... and it gives a middle finger to the constitution as it continues to happen.

At that point I begin to consider that person doesn’t realize that I’m correct...
...then they write me off as if I’m contradicting myself...
So then the logic board has to be whipped out.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Logic Board",@"
Something violating the Constitution → Is illegal → Isn’t supposed to happen → Happens anyway → Someone 
hears all that → They find it hard to believe → It’s accurate → They assume somebody should do something 
about that → they fuck off.
    
Yeah. Well, if people are just finally latching on to what I’m saying and they really are paying attention 
to me cause they believe me... I’m not gonna insult those people. 

They apparently see that I’m making plenty of sense after all. What DOESN’T make sense, is the foundation 
of lies they were told. so they have to pick apart everything they know and rebuild their perceptions from 
the ground up. That’s what I spent 4 years doing. Adults in the workforce are gonna have a real hard time 
doing that if they have to go to work every day and fulfill some bottom line business model...
...which means they may constantly doubt it.

However, when I suggest that the police don’t give a shit about drug dealers selling drugs, not unless 
they’re selling thousands of pounds of the stuff... That’s accurate. They don’t care. But- some of the things 
that will REALLY piss them off... is when one of THEIR kids dies from the drugs they bought. They don’t give 
a shit if YOUR kid gets killed from the drugs... because 1) YOU and 2) YOUR KID, aren’t fuckin’ important. 
Neither am I or my kids. 

I accept that reality, even though I cannot fucking stand they think this way... because when it’s THEIR 
fuckin’ kid that dies from the drugs... That’s it bro. 
That ... was the last straw. 
Wasn’t when it was anybody else’s kid, cause people like Kevin Andrews will die every day. 
All because some cocksucker named Richard Sackler. 
Wasn’t such a serious issue until this fuckface, started getting people hooked to synthetic heroin. 
Only, calling it MS Contin, or Oxycontin.

Not sure if people remember Heath Ledger, but, that dude died from this shit. Richard Sackler told people 
it wasn’t that addictive. But, it sure as hell was. VERY addictive. When people JUDGE some of the people 
who USE drugs, they don’t realize that Hydrocodone, Percocet, they’re NOT heroin, not really all that 
close, BUT- they still cause someone to become addicted to an entire category of drugs, therefore, creating 
money out of thin air, resulting in a lot of people requiring hospitalizations, and... get this... 
Methadone and Suboxone programs that Richard Sackler get to make MORE money off of.
    
It perplexes me really, that this man makes money no matter what. If anyone deserves to be gunned down by 
maniacs at grocery stores, he is one of those people, for damn sure... But, I can’t tell karma what to do.
Karma makes its own decisions. 

Sometimes I will entertain the idea of swapping roles with a person, to understand what they may think.
That is why I am such a successful manipulator, because I can understand other people’s perspective(s).
Maybe by writing all of these ideas and skits down, someone else will be able to figure out these things too.

Like, Richard Sackler probably will probably never remain comfortable in his own skin, or in public.
I’m not saying that the dude actually deserves to be gunned down by some lunatic.
Nobody does. But, this guy will live out the rest of his days not having a way to relish his riches.
Besides, can’t have somebody like him who lied to a lot of people, worry about his past decisions.
I think that a guy like him, will have to work really hard, to stop thinking about all the people he hurt.

There’s a story by Edgar Allen Poe, where some dude winds up killin’ some dude, and puts him underneath 
the floorboards, and investigators keep coming back to interview with him, and the guy in the story is 
overwhelmed by the notion that the guy he killed is speaking to him...

So he winds up going nuts and confessing to what he did, he believes that he is hearing the dead man speak.
Same concept probably applies, where the voice is so deafening...? He can’t go anywhere or do anything without
worrying what someone might do if they saw him. And, that’s probably just as bad as being in prison.

Anyway, if a federal investigator has a problem with ME, whatever man. I know I’m not innocent or anything.
But I do actually care about other people, even him, and HIS kid. I’ve never killed anybody... but sometimes
I feel RESPONSIBLE for situations where I had nothing to do with a tragic scenario, but could’ve said SOMETHING
to alter the outcome somehow. Like, this material, this book... I don’t expect people to get it the first time 
they read it. Some might, most won’t... but I am certain, something will cause someone to read it again.

This guy who always had an axe to grind toward me...? I’m willing to say something to piss HIM off too, if 
what I say might even save HIS kids life, and HIM from living the rest of his days wondering what he could’ve
done differently. Cause if I don’t, I’m gonna feel accountable in some way, regardless of the fact that I was
not involved. Something I say might cause him to find out that his kid was addicted. And then, he took a step 
back, realized that I said something to save his kids life... and I did it to spare him the pain I’ve felt for 
such a long time. 

Yeah, I might be writing this thing to be WAY longer than it needs to be... 
But, the reason why I’m putting everything I’ve got, into this fuckin’ thing, is for a noble cause.

For some people, their kid wound up overdosing on drugs that Richard Sackler openly distributed in America... 
for years... causing an epidemic. 
Their kid was convinced to TRY something, cause it was COOL. 
Ignored the finger waved in their face, got addicted...
Then, the kid winds up dead from an overdose. 

If this is America, and it still runs off of the Constitution... where is the line that needs to be crossed 
before this son of a bitch is served his overdue justice...? Is justice all about dollar signs...?
Is there no stack of cash too large for Murdock to tape up and throw at somebody, where they’re not going to 
allow themselves to be bought...? If people don’t understand what questions they SHOULD be asking, then I
have to show people how to do that. Yeah, I’m gonna annoy some people. Oh well. I’m not asking for permission
to change the course of history... I’m just gonna keep going until I can’t go anymore.

The line is somewhere. It hasn’t been crossed yet.
So, I have to consider what major component to the last straw for most people...
Might have to be someone A LOT more important, than a federal investigator, for somebody to say to this dude:
"You are under arrest, you have the right to remain silent, anything you can say and WILL be used against 
you in a court of law... etc." 
That guy knows what I’m alluding to. Why hasn’t anyone done that yet?
    
It’s because, guys like him...? They’re special. You and I? We’re not. Richard Sackler, can literally be 
like Pablo Escobar...? And nobody can do a fuckin’ thing to stop him. Cool huh? I’m bein’ facetious by the 
way, I don’t think that’s cool at all. So, unless you’re in a high enough class of people, where you have a 
badge or served in the military... chances are rather slim.
Even in some cases, they’re not important enough either.

Whoever it is in this legion of "Who’s who and what’s what..." 
If THEIR child, who’s a lot more important than any of us will EVER fucking be, that puts them in a category 
called "royalty". As far as I can tell, America does not HAVE royalty, except it most certainly fuckin’ does... 
But hey, if their child dies from a drug overdose, because some moron sold them shit laced with fentanyl or
whatever... They won’t care until it’s THEIR kid in the fuckin’ coffin.

I’m not even going to deposit a word like ‘aw’ because I would get pissed off if I were in their shoes, 
reading what I write... cause they will want to blame me somehow. Only at that point, when someone special 
has their kid die from a drug overdose, or shot to death by some lunatic in a rampage... will these things 
that could be resolved by compassion and understanding... actually be a serious thing. Until then, nobody 
really has control of the situation. Not even Richard Sackler, believe it or not. 

Pretty sure that dude is terrified by the number of things he hears about, reads, or sees... I feel bad for 
that dude. He will never be able to walk outside for the rest of his life in public. Cause someone will 
probably find out.

Afterward, ah. 
THEN Mr. Sackler might get a sentence, and tell that judge who gave him immunity, that his order is 
invalidated, and then Richard goes to prison. Has all of his assets frozen, taken, and then he’s just stuck 
in a jail cell like JULIEN ASSANGE. 

The people at the prison will be tempted to give him a taste of his own medicine, in all likelihood.
The people in prison don’t fuck around, either. They might ‘accidentally’ inject him with a lethal injection 
before he ever makes it into a prison cell... and I think that is the real reason why he isn’t there already.

Because, just like Richard Sackler didn’t know that the drugs he distributed were THAT addictive...?
Well, someone will want the scale of justice to be balanced out.

See the problem?
    
At least guys like Mark Zuckerberg aren’t distributing drugs that wind up killing people. 
Well, technically that’s not even true, because some drugs are being sent through Instagram, killing kids. 
Then there are people killing themselves because of their self-image issues, and depression. 
    
His company has some other serious fucking issues... who knows if they’ll be resolved. 
They probably are trying to do something about it, but... having people spend more time on the platform has
detrimental effects to people’s psyche. Not unlike that kid that killed a bunch of people because he thought 
he was playing Halo. The "Halo killer"... People aren’t going to self-moderate at that level.
    
Regardless, whatever the case may be, some people don’t realize, I was tryin’ to look out for this son of a 
bitch AND his kid, and everyone else’s. Whether it’s global warming that’s causing irreversible damage to 
the planet, or drugs killing people, or APT29 targeting me at Computer Answers, Dwayne Coonradt isn’t smart 
enough to know that’s what happened. Wish he was. Pavel, probably asked someone to kill me, but I don’t know. 
"A couple dudes trying to kill me with an advanced program like Pegasus/Phantom on 5/26/2020"... cause the 
guys from SCSO really think that shit sounds insane. 

It does, but it’s a real thing.
Now, even though I write all this stuff to help people step outside of the realm of society, 
(which is hard to do) a society that is literally broken from inside out...

Look. Everybody has something they would prefer NOT to talk about...
Realistically, I think everybody on this list would trade with Bob Lutz on any given day of the week...
But- a cool bastard named Michael Halpern once told me something when I once worked for Nfrastructure...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Halpern : Hey, I’ve got a little advice for ya.
Me      : *pauses* alright...?
Halpern : If everybody got together, and sat in a room...
          ...and everybody put THEIR problems into a hat...
          ...and everybody had a chance to have somebody ELSES problems...
          ...everybody would take their own problems back.
Me      : I mean, it does sound pretty good...
          Probably why you’re in SALES.
Halpern : Damn straight, buddy.
          Keep up the good work.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

The notion is that if everybody had a chance to “swap problems” with somebody, they’re gonna take their problems
back, because they’re familiar to you. Yeah, some problems are worse than others... but just cause Richard Sackler 
is a rich bastard, doesn’t mean that he’s really comfortably living, able to spend it and do whatever he wants. 

That dude probably doesn’t understand when someone like myself says: “I feel sorry for that dude.”
It’s not like I’m lying, either. 
He did that shit to himself, admittedly...

But, it’s still sad to realize that he allowed his morals to be so twisted, that he probably doesn’t see the
damage he’s caused. I’m being totally serious... dude probably was raised by people that have no inkling of 
morality... just, cash is the most important thing in the world.

I wanna give those people the benefit of a doubt, that it wasn’t like that. I don’t like to assume the worst
about people... But- sometimes you have to consider these things to make a point to other people...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me   : *pointing at Sackler* That’s the guy you wanna not be, girls and boys...
Them : Who’s he...?
Me   : That’s Richard “Dick Tickler/Tackler” Sackler...
       He is a very sad man...
Them : Why is he a very sad man...?
Me   : He has a lot of money, but, nobody really likes him.
Them : Oh yeah...?
Me   : Yeah, he has to PAY PEOPLE, to like him.
       That means he has no genuine relationships with people.
Them : He... pays people to like him...?
Me   : Yup. 
       Probably cries himself to sleep every night with a fresh `$500 bill, too...
       Poor guy.
Them : But if he’s rich he can just BUY friends, can’t he?
Me   : Yeah, you CAN buy friends, but they are more like “friends”, not friends.
       That means they PRETEND to be his friends.
Them : Oh.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Yeah, Richard Sackler probably still has a few friends, but they reluctantly talk to him.
He’ll call and just be annoying...

          *phone continues ringing for a moment, then stops*

Sackler : Hey, what’s up buddy...?
Guy     : Not much man, what’s up with you...?
Sackler : Oh, just hanging out...
          Just seeing what you were up to today.
Guy     : Uh, I’m goin’ fishin’.
Sackler : Cool. Mind if I go with ya?
Guy     : You got a pole...?
Sackler : Nah, but I can get one...
Guy     : *chuckles* Listen buddy, you’re a billionaire that doesn’t have a fishing pole...?
Sackler : Maybe I am...? So what...?
Guy     : Dude, you probably don’t even know how to fish...
Sackler : Yeah I do.
Guy     : Alright, where do you like to fish...?
Sackler : Wherever man. 
          I go wherever.
Guy     : Dude, I don’t really wanna go fishin’ with ya, sorry.
Sackler : Alright, what about some fuckin’ paintball or somethin’...?
          I’ve got like a fuckin’ huge ass paintball arena.
Guy     : Buddy, I’m like, a fuckin grown ass man.
Sackler : Grown ass men play paintball bro.
Guy     : Nah, buddy I’m all set. 
Sackler : Eh, c’mon man, I’ll pay ya like `$500.

Look, I am sure that Sackler has a few buddies that will look past the hundreds of thousands of people his 
company has killed. That being said, I find it pretty difficult to believe that people are gonna have an easy
time doing that. There’s a reason why this dude has been using every trick in the book to avoid being held
accountable for so many people overdosing on his medications.

The point is this, whoever this person is whose child has to die from an unexpected overdose from his medications
that SOMEHOW was of a high level of importance BEFORE Richard Sackler gets arrested and brought to prison...

…apparently it’s gotta be somebody REALLY fuckin’ important, and/or rare. 
They’ll start to have these dark twisted thoughts about what they would do if they saw Richard Sackler...

Not unlike Donald Margolis in Breaking Bad. 
The air traffic controller was overwhelmed and stressed out over his daughter dying from a heroin overdose. 
Walter White actually killed her. He killed her because he moved something, then she rolled over. 
After she did, she aspirated on her own vomit, puking and not waking up. 
She couldn’t breathe, he then watched it happen... and allowed it to happen.  
Because she was apparently a threat to him, and sorta blackmailed Walter.

That scene is a striking visual, of what happens when people don’t necessarily OVERDOSE...?  
But they aspirated on their own vomit while sleeping. 
That’s not EXACTLY an overdose death... though, it’s certainly an INDIRECT cause. 
Most overdose deaths happen IMMEDIATELY after ingesting the drug. Although talking about it will probably make 
people feel uncomfortable, the alternative is basically having a dead family member. 

Because people aren’t going to TALK about "Hey, I do drugs like heroin...~!"
Cause there’s a large stigma associated with drug use.
Not to mention, the fentanyl they make now, is SO DANGEROUS, it ALONE has caused a RISE in overdose deaths.
Typically they will mix the two and then pass it off as some “high octane” stuff.
So “high octane”, that a single use can kill the user.

Last Week Tonight covered the subject about how some of the police will take a whiff of fentanyl, and man...
...knocked em out cold. (← that’s impossible)

Regardless, it is still a very serious drug that can kill people incredibly easily, if it gets on somebody’s 
skin, or in their pores... or if it’s ingested through the mouth, or even touching an eyeball...? 
That’s gonna send something really fuckin’ potent into that persons system without hitting their liver.
The liver does most of the filtration when it is ingested. (← BIOAVAILABILITY changes for each route)

Regardless, the point of discussing these things isn’t to give people ideas. 
It’s to explain HOW EASY IT IS TO DIE FROM.

First use, kills a LOT of people. So, they don’t even get a chance to become an addict. They tried it...? Died.
It is a serious problem that isn’t talked about beforehand... 
So no one thinks to say to their kid "You better not be doin’ fuckin heroin~!"
They don’t realize that when they say “Better not be such and such...” 
...it causes people to become CURIOUS about it.
Then, the curiosity is what winds up becoming a kid being found dead.

Oh. Cool.
Sounds like saying “You better not be doin’ fuckin heroin~!” will definitely work, won’t it? 
Nah, it won’t.
That approach sorta sucks ass, actually. Ask Donald Margolis about how that worked out.
I’ll provide some ideas that DO work, shortly.

Donald Margolis was so distraught over his daughters’ death, that he became distracted as an air traffic 
controller, and allowed (2) planes to crash in midair. This is historically PRETTY RARE, but- the moral of 
the story is, even a parent that GOES with their kid to meetings, could one day still wind up watching their 
kid get zipped up in a body bag. 

The result was, that killed a lot of ADDITIONAL people... All of it was resultant to Walter White. 
A lot of people think Walter White is the GOOD GUY on the show. Nah. He sure as hell isn’t.
He just, never made the connection that something so small as Jane rolling over, causing that many people 
to die... though he does play with the idea in the “ship in a bottle” episode, “Fly”.
    
Most people never find out in REAL LIFE, that they did something that caused a lot of people to die. 
However, when it’s pretty obvious that the mainstream media continues to say "climate change isn’t real", well...
Inclement weather has certainly gotten a lot worse and it has been killing a lot of people.

But, so is something like Richard Sackler lying to people about the likelihood that people will get addicted 
to his medicine. This thing he did led to people getting hooked to painkillers and opiates, and then the 
issue spiraled out of everybody’s control.
    
Someone’s kid is gonna die for each day that goes by, for each additional day throughout the rest of time, 
because Richard Sackler was just too greedy. Now people have to worry about something far more deadly than 
heroin... fentanyl. Doesn’t feel like he’s required to hold himself accountable, nor is liable for those 
people being a bunch of fuckin’ drug addicts, at all. Neither did the judge that allowed McKesson/Purdue, 
to keep this dude separated from any criminal liability for anything Purdue or McKesson did distributing 
those drugs. 
    
If I tell someone like Eric Schnakeberg about somethin’ like that, he won’t give a flying fuck. 
Even though he used to write my prescription for (buprenorphine/Suboxone) that I was able to get MYSELF off 
of, without HIM having to do that. Dude constantly forgot about it too. That dude, I should’ve been able to 
confide in when SCSO wrote a bunch of false shit on a report (03-01-2022), and I recorded an audio recording 
of the whole thing.

Nobody really asks me how I got addicted to those drugs, anyway.
Well, it’s cause a greedy cocksucker spammed the market with Oxycontin, Hydrocodone, and Percocet, after
the US started getting a very steady supply from Afghanistan. Not to mention, I have degenerative spine
disease, which means that every once in a while (2) things happen... 1) a disc will SLIP, MAD PAINFUL, and 
2) the bones in my spine constantly ‘crack’, or ‘pop’.

Now, despite the fact that I got myself off of all that shit, Eric Schakenberg...? 
Probably forgets all of that, AND, probably thinks that Pegasus/Phantom doesn’t fuckin’ exist.
Cool.
I remember this dead eyed look that this cocksucker gave me the last time I told him what was really on my mind.
He’s lucky I didn’t assault him. 
    
A lot of people I talk to, think that there’s NO FUCKIN WAY I’m THAT important, that someone would attempt to 
murder me with a TEAM of private military contractors that had an exploit installed and deployed to my fuckin’ 
device.

I’m so unimportant that SCSO just continued to call me delusional, except, when I explain to people what’s in 
many of their reports, there’s a jizz-on-the-chin aspect to them, that I found out about with the private
investigation work I had to do... SCSO has honesty/accuracy issues. It’s called "private investigation" because
that’s sorta what FOIL requests are.
    
Eric Schnakenberg is the type of dude who will prescribe me Suboxone for years, and then forget that I 
got myself off of it, and he literally had to ask me "Are you sure you wanna do this...?" Yeah. That’s a real 
thing that happened. It’s strange. People like him think I’m a pathetic loser and that I can’t manipulate 
people a lot more intelligent than he is. 

Then eventually he might say to himself in the mirror: 
Eric: Damn. Might’ve been a lazy cocksucker after all...
    
That’s ok. Really. I know that these things I write, make some people feel inferior.
Because they eventually realize, I’m just some nobody attempting to be some type of equalizer or some shit. 
    
Anyway, look, the drug dealers that piss these ACTUAL IMPORTANT people off...
Once they know you’re not Richard Sackler, it’s game on motherfucker. They’ll pour thousands of hours 
into eavesdropping on a bunch of people that think they’re fuckin slick... but they happen to be a LOT more 
slick than you or anybody else. Eric Schnakenberg would’ve done well for himself, to understand what WEEPING 
WILLOW is, which is the reason cybercriminals and hackers were stealing people’s money when Andrew Banas 
reported about it back in 2018. 
    
Guys like Eric, too important, to see a correlation between IDENTITY THEFT, CYBERCRIME, RUSSIA, PAVEL ZAICHENKO,
and fuckin’ ESPIONAGE. The drug dealers are a very low priority... what they care about the most, are threats 
to national security. I could tell Dr. Schnakenberg that I am essentially a security engineer, and that shit 
just slipped right past his head. 
    
Could be because for a doctor? He’s an arrogant prick. He’s not alone though, even many of the people from SCSO, 
they fuckin’ just don’t get it. It’s not a consistent case where I have (3) dudes from SCSO ignore EVERY WORD I 
SAY, and then INJECT WORDS I NEVER SAID, into a report. 

When these people LOOK at me, they UNDERESTIMATE the graveness of my situation, and they will make the fastest 
assumption they can, that I’m talking out of my ass. Which, that’s exactly why I will roast them in these 
documents, because... what the hell else can I do? If I offer to assault them for their attitude, yeah, they 
might wake up later and realize how stupid that was... but then I’m gonna get myself in trouble.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Changing Direction",@"
I didn’t go around being a miserable prick throwing my intellect around, insulting random people PRIOR, to the 
night I was almost killed. In fact, maybe I should elaborate because I did do that after I noticed that an 
employer owed me like `$4K. Somehow, I was expected to do a job, but- I was owed a lot of money. 

This is after a history of me working for somebody, working my ass off, and then somehow my contributions get 
completely written off. Do I get a thank you letter from the Hearst Corporation for working with them for 3
years, lugging newspapers all around Saratoga County...? Nah. “Thanks for your hard work and dedication dude...”
Nah, what I got, was the same thing that several other guys got, a “Severance Check” cause they sold our 
contracts to Hamilton News. Basically, a dude that always took 10 hours to do a 2-hour job. COOL.

Then at Nfrastructure, *chuckles* I am fairly certain that the REAL REASON I WAS TERMINATED, has something to do
with my FATHER. But- let’s assume that it had nothing to do with him at all... I suspected, even back then, that 
somebody found out something by cutting some corners in terms of morality. I specifically mean, somebody was able
to use these programs used for matters of national security, to just see what the hell I was doing.

What I mean specifically, is... committing corporate espionage, regular espionage, insider trading, things 
of that nature. It’s not like I just had a hunch ONE DAY, and decided to start saying shit. Nah, there was a 
PATTERN of observed behavior that caused me to make an audio recording about 8 years after I had gotten fired.

AND- I never even gave that fuckin’ audio recording to anybody, but-hey. Somebody apparently got a hold of it.
Nah I’m not even gonna rattle off the rest of the list, because I know damn well I was right about that. 

So it started small, I realized that basically everybody lies about whatever they feel like, all the time...
Then once I concluded that I can’t trust anyone because some dude named Ed Snowden released some shit that made
me better “connect the dots” regarding the USA-PATRIOT Act, I was able to “connect the fuckin’ dots” alright.
Then, Assange leaked Vault 7. Then Banas did an interview with me about a year afterward. There was quite an 
uptick in the number of customers/clients that I serviced, who were just getting money ripped from their bank,
and NOBODY WAS DOING ANYTHING.

Sorta how like you can’t really bring 19 kids and 2 teachers back from the dead after they’ve been shot, the 
police aren’t able to track down these scam centers that I had to fuckin constantly clean up after, and to be 
fair, those people probably are starving over in India. Doesn’t mean that some dude at Google or Microsoft 
should write up a script on how to rip people off, and then just spam the shit out of people until they swipe
their credit card for `$500+. Yeah, somebody at these tech companies send shit back to their home country. 

That’s what I was seeing, and my suspicions caused me to reach out to Michael Niehaus at Microsoft, labeling a 
video RICO. Because I had a feeling that’s what I was dealing with. I didn’t see anyone give a flying fuck 
that I was actually calling the police and trying to help them and give them leads. Nah. The general attitude 
has always been “Look dude, you’ve gotta lot of nerve to call the police and give them leads... ACTUAL COPS 
DO THAT ALREADY.”

Oh ok. Do any of those cops know where the power button is on a computer...? Cause, I have a feeling that they
don’t. I can like, show ya...? Lady had `$20K stolen from her, and you guys never even turned her computer on...
Cool. Hm. I used to think the police did stuff about all that. As far as I can tell, if someone gets rightfully
pissed off, they’ll just drag someone like ME over to a list of people I shouldn’t even be a part of.

Then, after running this dudes company for like 3 years, I kept telling Dwayne and Pavel that I was gonna put
them out of business, because they were stealing shit from customers. But guess what...? They have friends that
seem to be part of the local AND state government... So they can literally hack their own customers AFTER doing
service, right...? And be the group of people that steals their money, forcing the customers to come back to the
store again. Charge more money. Wait a while. Attack the customer again, have them spend more money...

Oh. That’s what I got pissed at these dickheads for. Maybe about 25% of the talent I have, and about 10% of my
motivation. That’s me being pretty generous. You’ll never find Dwayne Coonradt building a network, or running
his own cables, NOR REALLY, knowing how to save a tax professionals entire business from a hard drive that was
just about failed. Dwayne had jealousy issues. He kept undermining my contributions to the company. That’s 
when I started blastin’ this dude. 

The ring of crime that I was observing, that was just perpetuating itself without anybody asking any fuckin’ 
questions, got pretty big. I wouldn’t put it past Hoffman, Tanski, Pickett’s, that they were doing some shady
shit with KeyCorp. It seemed like there was NO FUCKIN WAY, that Pavel Zaichenko knows how to deploy RANSOMWARE, 
DDOS, and CVE to the equipment I was servicing. 

Maybe neither Tanski or Hoffman would either, BUT- I do specifically remember when the ENDPOINT ENCRYPTION 
PROTECTION at KeyCorp failed one day, and ALL of the systems needed to be rebooted. Yeah, I remember it was 
a GUID that popped up, and I think that these guys had something to do with that. 

They were like right in the midst of the FNFG → KeyBank merger, Nfrastructure just had Matthew Roerig install a 
bunch of switches at a lot of branches, July 2016. I don’t think Matt Roerig is the guy doing that. But- he seems 
to be involved in a number of questionable incidents.

He sent me a message on Signal that came through on my device, even though I had DISABLED THE WIFI, BLUETOOTH 
AND CELL at or about OCTOBER/NOVEMBER 2018. Huh. How did that message come through...? 

Then, I was talking to him on January 15th, 2019. I had told Matt about the recording I made on January 11th, 2019. 
Then miraculously (4) days later, serious cyber-attack... so, I asked myself thousands of questions, and STILL DO.

I’m going to cover the events of (06/13/20 → 06/22/20), though the first entry will cover details from…
…(06/10/20 → 06/13/20).
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"June 13th, 2020 (1)",@"
I was in a verbal altercation with my mother and stepfather. 

I’m going to tangent off to events BEFORE June 13th, 2020, so that when I explain what happened that day…? 
It’ll make a lot more sense to anybody else.

As for the verbal altercation on June 13th, 2020 that ESCALATED…

A lot of the verbal altercations we kept having, stem from the fact that my mother and stepfather are delusional.
When I say DELUSIONAL, what I mean is that they may have BOTH experienced SEVERE BRAIN DAMAGE. 
They DON’T understand how LITTLE EMPATHY they have.
When I tell them things that have been goin’ on to me, such as KEEN OBSERVATIONS I HAVE MADE… 
they UNDERMINE and PLACATE those observations and tell me that don’t think that what I’m saying is accurate.

What I mean is, they have a problem making CORRELATIONS between the TRUTH, as well as my EXPERIENCE, as well as my
HISTORY, as well as how people in SOCIETY have treated me. So, work I have done my whole life, and people writing 
off my accomplishments specifically. It’s not ok.

Pretty sure that neither my mother or stepfather would actually care if I went missing.
I mean, I know they WOULD, like months after they realized I fuckin’ went missing... 
But- even if I tell them 500 times...
That I was afraid of this guy driving around in his blue truck, following me whenever I’d carry my phone with me...
They have experienced too much brain damage to understand what I’m saying.

So, they do the same thing that they always do... pretend like anything I say is imaginary, made up, doesn’t 
actually exist in the real world. MAYBE for some people, they enjoy knowing that my father was killed. They 
probably clap and say “I’m glad your fuckin’ father was murdered, you obviously did something to deserve it.”

However, for anybody that’s paying attention... I’m pretty sure some people will audibly state “No...? That’s 
fucked up dude.” It is. But that is exactly how my mother acts. She doesn’t say those words, but if I tell her
that I have a video of Spectrum, or SOMEBODY, (Attacking my cable modem - https://youtu.be/H4MlJnMh9Q0)... 
…she doesn’t know what the hell that even means. 

Explaining it to her, is pointless. 
What it means is that the service provider is charging me money, and is still causing service disruption.
This happened to me in MANY PLACES, with MULTIPLE PROVIDERS, and it was HAPPENING as a direct RESULT, of my WORK.
OH. Yeah. Of course, explaining that to people results in people waving me off because they think I am being
ridiculous. On the other hand, some of those people may actually KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING, and thus they 
will PRETEND that they think it’s ridiculous, which is INCREDIBLY MALICIOUS. 

Sorta has that whole “UNCLE RICK SMITH” vibe to it.

The content of that video above, is from years ago… like, OCTOBER 2019. 
That’s like, 9 months after the cyberattack at COMPUTER ANSWERS – 1602 US-9, 12065. 
However A MONTH EARLIER…? I posted a video that specifically discusses some CRITICAL SUBJECTS in relation to… 

(HARDWARE SECURITY – https://youtu.be/-jkDPv9h6BQ)
Guess who I spoke about in that video…?

Nfrastructure. Guess who else…? 
The hackers that were using the VAULT 7 tool, WEEPING ANGEL/WILLOW, using the SmartTV’s to EAVESDROP ON PEOPLE 
WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE. I didn’t specifically talk about VAULT 7, nor JULIEN ASSANGE, nor that the CENTRAL 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY PROJECT KNOWN AS “WEEPING ANGEL”, WAS THE REASON WHY ANDREW BANAS HAD THAT STORY ON THE 
ALERT DESK, BECAUSE IT WAS REVERSE ENGINEERED.

Ahhhh... so when I whip out the whole “THINGS THAT FACTUALLY HAPPENED ROLODEX OF FACTOIDS”… 
Well, people like Rick Smith, Kristin Johnson, Michael Streeter, Fabienne Cook, Bill Moak, Janet Moak…
They don’t realize how ALL of these FACTOIDS were the REASON why I was having an ARGUMENT with my MOTHER, on…?
June 13th, 2020. Cool. So, now that the FACTOIDS are specifically LISTED and ARRANGED…?
NOW we have the ability to do ACTUAL INVESTIGATION of CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES committed by HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.
That would include SOME of the aforementioned parties. Cool…? Alright.

June 13th, 2020 -> My kids needed the internet to do their school work.
It was pretty early in the COVID epidemic, I had spoken to the school resource officer, Mr. Muller…
…and we spoke rather briefly about the situation, so he suggested that I go to the campus to get a hotspot.

And, that is IMMEDIATELY WHAT I DID. Being a GOOD parent. Not a SHITTY parent.
I went to the campus to get a hotspot for the kids.
Apparently, people didn’t get what my problem was.
Cause when I say words, I swear, I can say “I MANAGED A COMPUTER SHOP FOR 3 FUCKING YEARS. I KNOW WHAT IM DOIN’.”
Well, people will think that I’m overcompensating, or bullshitting them, somehow. 
Because cable modems don’t just stop working for no reason...
Yeah, I’m not overcompensating a fuckin’ thing. 
Literally studied the Cisco Certified Network Academy back in 2001.
Literally know what the fuck I’m talking about. Literally an expert. Not exaggerating. I know what I’m doing.
I don’t know man, I think people look at me and they automatically assume that I’m retarded. 

I was fed up with the service from Spectrum because there is literally a monopoly in the town of Clifton Park, 
and that is… the main reason why I started taking all of the PICTURES, VIDEOS and AUDIO LOGS in: 
[Chapter 4 - The Week].

What I mean is, if I tell people that I have some evidence that could probably be super useful in a lawsuit...
...nobody seems to register what the fuck I’m saying. So, I have to use analogies.

Imagine if you BOUGHT FOOD that was ALREADY PREPARED at a GROCERY STORE, and IT got YOU so sick one day, that 
you had to be rushed to the hospital, because you had an EXTREMELY BAD CASE of FOOD POISONING...? 

Well...? You probably would never believe it, but 100% of the people I kept running into, who kept mislabeling
me… They were tryin’ to fuckin’ tell me something along the lines of: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Them: You obviously did that shit to yourself. 
      Nobody MADE you eat the food that got you sick.
      So, it’s YOUR fault.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

That is how my mother treats me. She treated my father that way too, and that’s probably why he’s dead.

So, after my father was MURDERED, by the SAME PEOPLE that TRIED TO KILL ME TOO...
Oh. My mother is basically a <unspecified> who emotionally abandoned me after he was killed, spent 0 hours a 
week with me helping me do my homework, was very MINIMALLY INVOLVED IN RAISING ME… she’s gonna find it hard 
to believe that some very dangerous and elusive bastards have been targeting me and going so far as to 
sabotage my work and even attempt to murder me, and even go so far as to cover up all of the felonious 
activities THEY did, right…? But, she’s just ASSUMING that I’m babbling on about some bullshit.

Wanna know why…? It is simply because, my mother has NEVER, not once in my whole life really…
…given a single fuck or care about my skills, talents, or passions. 

I’m totally serious too, she’s never seen me play a video game and asked questions about what I was doing, 
or how cool something looked that I built, she would raise her arms up and say: 
“How am I supposed to know whether that’s COOL or INTERESTING…?”

Well, this is why I tell people that my father was a LOT smarter than she is... 
...and HE was VERY INVOLVED in things I did.

I still wound up doing alright for myself for a while, but apparently, if I’m not working somewhere, then no 
words are able to be said about the severity of my situation where it registers in HER BRAIN, or my 
GRANDMOTHERS BRAIN. I am certain that the problem is the same all across the board… most people don’t realize 
how valuable I am.

When I say that, people will immediately assume that I mean how much money I possess, or how many things I own.
I would have a lot more to show for all of my hard work if I wasn’t constantly written off by a bunch of uncaring
assholes… but, even STILL… what makes me valuable is the long list of abilities and skills I have, where I have a
rather high pedigree of a PARTICULAR ATTRIBUTE, and it’s called TALENT.

People don’t realize how valuable my skills are, and they can just write me off.
I can fill out hundreds of job applications.
I’ll be overqualified for every fuckin’ job I apply for.
Someone will assume that I’m bullshitting them somehow... there’s no way that I have more experience than any other
candidate. Yeah there is, actually.

I could be working with KENNETH YATES (Business Products Company) at 1763 US-9, CLIFTON PARK NY.

Does it make sense why I would do something bold and audacious at that point…?
Ok. So, I had an appearance on 04/06/21, and I recorded an AUDIO LOG the DAY BEFORE, about how I had a feeling
that the people at SARATOGA COUNTY were pulling some fucking FUNNY BUSINESS TO ME, SPECIFICALLY.

Should I have gotten snippy with Neil Weiner…? 
Probably not, but when SCHELLINGER and WEINER were basically CHOOSING to do something RIDICULOUS…
…such as, [ISSUING A PUBLICATION OF SERVICE IN A STATE THE CHILDRENS MOTHER HASN’T LIVED IN OVER (5) YEARS*]…
…and deciding not to pursue any course of action where a MORE EFFECTIVE METHOD IS USED TO FIND HER…
…for instance, USING THE LAST KNOWN ADDRESS OF THE MOTHER THAT I PAID A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR TO DETERMINE…
…is the one that I sent to MY PUBLIC DEFENDER…
…they’re gonna leave it at that, and do nothing further with that information, cause that’s fuckin DIFFICULT.
I’ll return to the DOING SOMETHING FURTHER WITH SPECIFIC INFORMATION in a moment.

I posted the recording above, on my Facebook account, and my god… light speed about it, someone gave LISA MENTES
a link to that post, and she was quite expedient about ensuring that the court obtained a record that I did that.

Understandable pissed about how the recording does a pretty fucking fantastic job of embarrassing the judge… 
…he sent me a letter asking me to EXPLAIN MYSELF, but I already did this to my PUBLIC DEFENDER.
I did write some shit to the judge, but if I had sent what I REALLY had to say…? 
Probably would’ve went to jail for the maximum amount of time. 

Regardless, I did NOT send that letter, and thus he decided on APRIL 23, 2021, to send me to jail for (20) days.
And, JUDGE PAUL PELAGALLI NEVER MAILED ME THE ORDER TO TURN MYSELF INTO THE JAIL. COOL.

The (20) days in jail, that I served, it STEMS from the ROOT CAUSE where… 
…he was careless with a court order he wrote. 
So, I’m not allowed to say anything in my own court appearance, nor defend myself, nor to really have a defense.
So, the reason why I have ALL of these EXCUSES, or EXCUSE after EXCUSE after EXCUSE…?
It’s because, they are PERFECT EXCUSES, where I WAS NOT DOING SOMETHING WRONG. SOMEONE ELSE WAS.

I’m surrounded by fucking lazy careless morons like my mother, or my stepfather, or…
…the SARATOGA COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE.

Just like when I told SCOTT SCHELLING about my 911 call in front of Center for Security, he thought it was TOO
DIFFICULT to COLLECT MY PICTURES or WATCH THE VIDEO, and WRITE NO NOTES WHATSOEVER in the CALL FOR SERVICE 
SCSO-2020-028501… which amazingly, wasn’t in my…

Ahhhhh… You would never believe how many months the SARATOGA COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE kept trying to HIDE…
…the NUMEROUS CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES IT COMMITTED… 
…on 05/26/20. 
But, hey… SCSO commits 7 felonies, doesn’t face any trouble or anything like that for any of it, IGNORES MY 
EVIDENCE IN CHAPTER “THE WEEK”, TRIES TO KILL ME, HAD CPS TAKE MY KIDS AWAY… 

But, hey. Look on the bright side.
These guys, are doing this county a fucking AMAZING service, by having FRED RENCH defend me for KARELS kayak 
strap. Not the PHONE LINE that I cut. Not the MURDER ATTEMPT that I was subjected to. Nah. All of that shit 
was annoying. Too much work for ANYBODY TO INVESTIGATE THAT SHIT, right…?

Amazing. That is exactly what I mean by a lot of people, are doing the BARE FUCKING MINIMUM. 
Such as, PAUL PELAGALLI.    
Cause… why the fuck not, these people are ALL doing some shady shit in UNISON, why not go the full measure…?

The mishap with the judge is something that people should take seriously. 
I didn’t write the COURT ORDER that HE WROTE incorrectly, I told my PUBLIC DEFENDER that it was WRITTEN 
INCORRECTLY, and she just didn’t get back to me.

What I DID say, RIGHT BEFORE THE ORDER WAS WRITTEN (12/10/20 or so…), was that I was ALREADY A PATIENT AT THAT 
CLINIC, SARATOGA COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH, and they ALL just PRETENDED as if they didn’t hear that… and then the 
RUSSIANS immediately launched the LARGEST CYBERATTACK IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES … SOLORIGATE.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach

Look, the reason why SOLORIGATE happened, is because there are a SHITLOAD of people making CARELESS MISTAKES in 
our government, law enforcement system, justice system, and, guys like me understand EXACTLY what the fuckin’ 
problem is. Ya know…? 

[Lots of people making careless mistakes*], and [they really don’t give a shit if they do*]. 
I didn’t send myself a court appearance that was off by 5 hours, which is what they were ALSO doing…

I didn’t sound like Neil Weiner coming up with excuses not to find the mother of the kids in Texas. 
Yeah, lets publish the thing in a town where she hasn’t lived in over half a decade. Cool. Awesome. 
I’m glad this dipshit gets a paycheck.

Anyway, this whole system appears to be completely fucked up. Maybe it’s JUST ME, though… Ya know...? 
Obviously I did this shit to myself. I fuckin’, was born... and then, I grew up, and then maybe it’s
the WAY I take a shit. It’s offending somebody... My bad bro.

As for how this relates to KENNETH YATES… 
When I was STUCK IN THE FUCKING JAIL, I asked my mother to GO TALK TO KEN.
I SPECIFICALLY STATED “time sensitive”, and this fuckin’ moron who happens to be my mother thought…
“wait till next week”, and then she did, and then the next time I spoke to her, she said that he was COOL…
…but when I got out of the jail, I found out that HE WASN’T FUCKIN COOL WITH IT AT ALL.

Wanna know why…? It’s because… ohhhhhhh… my fuckin’ moron mother thought that “time sensitive” meant…
“wait till next week”, so he lost out on the `$250 that he spent out of his OWN POCKET, on a DEFECTIVE 
MOTHERBOARD that the PART SUPPLIER SENT to his business, and KEN WAS PRETTY FUCKIN PISSED ABOUT THE 30-DAY 
RETURN POLICY THAT WAS EXCEEDED WHEN HE WAITED TOO LONG TO RETURN THE DEFECTIVE PART I REPEATEDLY ASKED HIM 
TO (RETURN/TAKE CARE OF).

Awesome. 
This has been an issue for some time now, when I DELEGATE FUNCTIONS to OTHER PEOPLE, they fuck it all up.
KEN was doing me a fucking FAVOR, by ALLOWING ME to ATTEMPT to DO BUSINESS at HIS SHOP. 
And, I had a `$700 sale, already lined up and good to go. Wanna know what wound up happening…?

Worst case scenario after worst case scenario. Just, over and over. This shit happens to me repeatedly.

As for my mother, maybe “time sensitive” meant “wait till next week” because GENERAL HOSPITAL and ONE LIFE TO LIVE,
are just too fuckin’ dramatic to take (5) minutes to go to a place that’s like a half mile away, and say 5 words, 
and then take off. 

Yeah, it was just your SON saying TIME SENSITIVE, for a BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT HE HAD…
That means, “My son is a fucking lowlife scumbag that I don’t have to take seriously, otherwise, he could
SUPPORT HIMSELF and his FUCKING CHILDREN.”

Ah. That is the point I am attempting to EXHIBIT in REAL TIME HIGH DEFINITION.
This is not me having a TEMPERAMENT issue, it’s someone CONSTANTLY SABOTAGING her own sons life. 

MAYBE when my mother used to say the words “I love you”, she meant “I hope you rot in hell for eternity.”
That’s me being dramatic. But I’ll bet my father has been thinkin’ of that sentence.

I can admit, I have an issue at times, not getting really pissed off.
That being said...? That doesn’t give other people the right to say that’s GOTTA BE the problem, then. 
Has to be. Couldn’t possibly be anything else except the ADMISSION that I made. Oh. I see how it is.
I can admit when I’m wrong PROMPTLY.

THEY HAVE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM.
A mother isn’t supposed to ARGUE with a child CONSTANTLY...
Especially when I have a COLLEGE DEGREE, and GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL, and GOT CERTIFIED BY MICROSOFT.
My mother will LITERALLY ARGUE WITH ME ABOUT FACTS.

She bought me a Packard Bell in 1996, which is when I first OWNED a computer. Not the first time I USED one...?
Owned, being the key word. I had used a number of computers prior to that, but my mother, doesn’t understand that.

Then she’ll tack on like 10 years and say there’s no way that I’ve been good with computers for *checks watch*
nearly 30 fuckin’ years now. She’ll say “It’s gotta be more like 5 years, dude.” I’m exaggerating that to a large 
degree, because that’s how she comes across every single time that we argue. When she had her hip surgery...?
I paid every fucking bill in the house. She seems to be CLUELESS, and ARGUES WITH ME ABOUT THAT.

If I tell her that I was in the hospital for 11 days at Albany Medical Center, because I had an INFECTION in my 
spine from the cortisone treatment I received... She will tell me that it wasn’t 11 days. Had to have been more 
like 4. And, she’ll even say “OBVIOUSLY I MUST’VE DONE THAT SHIT TO MYSELF. BECAUSE THAT SHIT DOESN’T HAPPEN 
TO ANYONE ELSE DUDE.”

[MY MOTHER WAS NOT ALWAYS LIKE THIS*].

As for what happened on June 13th, 2020…? All of the things I just mentioned, they’re SORTA RELEVANT.
I was having an argument with my mother and stepfather, I believe they have brain damage from lead poisoning.
They don’t know they have brain damage... It’s pretty severe for the both of em, because of how often they argue.

So, I have to talk to them like a preschooler whenever it comes to logic.
But then my mother will immediately call me a liar when I’m telling her the truth. “
ON SOME DAY PRIOR to JUNE 13th, 2020, I spoke to the school resource officer Mr. Muller. 
HE suggested that I go to Shenendehowa IMS to get a hotspot. 
I walked there, they said log in to submit a ticket, and I didn’t have a way to do that since ya know…
…you need a device, as well as an account, and access to the internet. Cool. 
Walked there and didn’t bring the thing with me. Anyway, fine.

I walk back home, get the laptop, and ask my son for his account and password.
He says “I don’t know what the password is.”
Oh. So, he doesn’t know his password... Huh.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Skit [~] Kristin Johnson",@"
My kid just lied to me, for the 7 billionth time.
Guess how I was able to get my sons password to his account...?
It’s cause I called ELIZABETH RILEY.
That’s his former teacher... and she is incredibly nice and generally cares a lot about this kid.
She’s always been super nice and helpful, and my son always talked highly about her too.
Too bad that the ACTUAL teacher, wasn’t like calling US, and saying “HEY, WHY HASN’T MICHAEL BEEN FINISHIN HIS 
SCHOOL WORK~?!”

Oh well, because the child would say “I already did my school work.”
Then I would say “I’d like to see it...” 
He would do the whole “I forgot my password, actually...”
OH COOL, KID.
Heh. People are gonna say I’m probably exaggerating; I’m not exaggerating shit.
Mrs. Riley had to email me this kids password, or maybe it was over the phone, I’m not positive.

What if... my kid started lying to me all the time, because his grandmother doesn’t know what a FACT is...?
What if... DWAYNE COONRADT is laughing about how often he steals shit from customers, meanwhile, my kids get 
taken away, I’m almost murdered, nobody does anything about that, then even though I called 911, there’s retarded
people at SCSO like James Leonard committing OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE... 
SO, if I tell KRISTIN JOHNSON, she’ll be a moron, and pretend that the problem is JUST ME.

Cool.
I think this is why guys like Ted Bundy just started killin’ people, I mean...
Allow me to make myself perfectly clear here... I have no intention of being a serial killer, and I invest 
quite a lot of energy in realizing that the world is not full of people that are as intelligent as me.
I’m starting to think I’m in like a 2% category of people.

Me      : Kristin Johnson, I was attacked by a couple dudes a while back, May 26th, 2020.
Johnson : What do you mean...?
Me      : Well, have you ever heard of “numbers”...? Like, 1, and then 2, and so on...?
Johnson : Obviously.
Me      : Oh, ok good. Well, (2) guys, that were like 25-30 years old, white males, backwards hats,
          backpacks, glasses... they tried to like, PHYSICALLY ATTACK me, outside of my old job where
          I worked for over 3 years.
Johnson : Yeah...? What would they attack you for...? What’s so special about you...?
Me      : Well, people that work in the FBI...? They actually think I’m worth watching.
Johnson : That automatically means something bad then.
Me      : Hey- that’s why you’re not real bright in my book.
          I mean, you’re treating my son, right...?
Johnson : Yeah. I am.
Me      : Oh, ok cool. 
          So, I know you’re supposedly the “expert” and everything... but I’m about to give you some 
          information. My son has been learning to lie constantly, from my mother.
Johnson : Oh really...?
Me      : Yeah, so I have a feeling that whatever you know, or THOUGHT you knew, about my son...?
          He was bullshitting you.
Johnson : Why would your son just lie all the time...?
Me      : Well, it could be because society is full of morons that lie to each other needlessly.
Johnson : Look, there’s no way that many morons lie constantly, or all the time.
Me      : Yeh there is. 
          Did you know, that every single conversation that you have on the school telephone...
          ...it’s like, recorded...?
Johnson : No it isn’t.
Me      : How do you know that...?
          How did you get this degree to be a psychiatrist or whatever, anyway...?
          Better yet, when the hell did you get your doctorate in psychiatry...?
Johnson : Like 2008.
Me      : Oh, cool, check it out...
          You should probably go back to that school, and don’t suck some dudes dick for the answers to 
          the tests, and like, do some actual studying... start from scratch. 
          Try to earn the degree the RIGHT way.
Johnson : Ya know, you’re a fuckin’ real asshole buddy...
Me      : Yup, damn straight. I gotta be.
          I studied for the Cisco Certified Network Academy back in 2001.
          The whole entire school’s telephone system uses Cisco equipment.
          Those calls are all recorded and backed up by the service provider.
Johnson : That sounds psychotic though. All of this.
Me      : It’s hard to call someone psychotic, and not come off lookin’ like a useless cuntrag,
          if you aren’t even willing to look at any of the pictures I took.
          Cause I have a copy of these fuckin’ pictures, I’ll give ya a copy of this stuff.
Johnson : You’re supposed to provide a SAFE HOME for your children.
Me      : Ah, well, check it out.
          Guess where I used to work...?
Johnson : Where...?
Me      : Nfrastructure. Guess where else...?
Johnson : Where...?
Me      : Computer Answers. Wanna know what I did at both of those places...?
Johnson : What’s that...?
Me      : I knew what the hell I was (saying/doing) on a daily basis.
          I even set actual sales records that no one has been able to match or exceed since...
          ...might as well be an infinite amount of time ago, really.
Johnson : Yeah, well, if you were as good as you say you are, why are you being attacked by random dudes...?
Me      : Oh, well check it out... I have pictures and videos of people using these sneaky ass exploits that 
          nobody in the entire Shenendehowa Campus would ever detect.
          I’ve got like dozens of these things too...
Johnson : Well, maybe you should call the police or somethin’...
Me      : Oh, I already did that actually. I already showed (1) guy named Shaemus Leavey, 
          the video of the (2) dudes that tried to murder me outside of Computer Answers.
          ALSO... SCSO has been aggressively ignoring the 911 calls I made that night.
Johnson : I don’t understand, you sound like you’re full of shit right now.
Me      : *eyes squinting* Well, if I’m OFFERING A COPY OF THE FUCKING PHOTOS I HAVE...
          … maybe they’re worth taking a fuckin’ look at...?
          ...I mean, an actual doctor SHOULD wanna see some of this shit too, right...?
Johnson : Look, I’m fuckin’ mad butt hurt that you’re being really mean to me right now.
Me      : Bitch, I will fuckin’ come to your office, right fuckin’ now, with the god damn thumb drive in 
          my hand.And I’ll show you these pictures that show the culprits.
          And, my 911 calls.
          And, if you’re lucky, I will tell you to fuckin’ stand up against the wall.
Johnson : What’s that supposed to mean...?
Me      : It means that you’re probably gonna do what I tell ya cause for some reason it sounded like a 
          good idea.
Johnson : So you’re just gonna show up with a thumb drive full of pictures that I should look at...?
Me      : Yep.
Johnson : Yeah, well, then what...? 
Me      : Well, like I said, if you’re lucky, I’m gonna tell you to get up against the wall...
Johnson : What’s that supposed to mean though...? If *I’m* lucky~?!
Me      : Yeah. You. If you happen to get lucky enough for me to bang the snot out of you in your office, 
          I might.
Johnson : *scoffs* Buddy... I don’t know what you’re even sayin’ right now, but... Jesus.
Me      : It’s still a bad idea though cause you will be real loud, I’m certain of it.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

In all honesty, I’m still pretty pissed with this woman. Probably not gonna feel like whipping my dick out, 
and smacking her across the face with it. Pretty sure she would enjoy that though. 

If she’s gonna enjoy something like that, then I have to phrase it as if I’d be reluctant to do that.
Cause then it’s not taking control of the situation to let her call CPS on me, commit CPS fraud, and then, 
I go to show her the pictures, but wind up making her office a total mess. Cause then she’d just be coming 
out ahead on all fronts. Ya know? OooOoOOhhhHhh call CPS on me, file a fraudulent case, don’t collect 
evidence of a crime, or multiple crimes happening to me, ah. COOL. So like, USED TO MANAGE A COMPUTER SHOP,
WASN’T BEING AN ASSHOLE, SOME ASSHOLE DECIDED TO USE A CVE, DDOS, RANSOMWARE, and PEGASUS, AND THEN SOME 
DUDE WHO STEALS SHIT FROM PEOPLE, AND LIES TO EM TOO... DECIDED TO SLANDER ME IN EVERY FUCKIN’ WAY POSSIBLE. 
Somehow this cunt is ok with all of those things...?

Realistically, I have to phrase it just like that...? Cause that happens to be the TRUTH.
I’ve tried to get Oliver Robinson’s attention too, but what the hell man...? 
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"June 13th, 2020 (2)",@"
As for the DAY OR TWO PRIOR to June 13th, 2020, when I walked to IMS, and realized I had to go back home…
…as soon as I got back to the house to grab the laptop, I asked my son for his account and password. 
He suddenly couldn’t remember his password.
Wanna know why...?
I’ll give the reader a clue or two...

My kid...?
Was learning how to lie repeatedly from his grandmother and grandfather.
Two people that apparently have brain damage... somehow not realizing that my son was learning to do all 
this, whereby getting his FATHER IN SERIOUS TROUBLE...
But nobody cares about the (2) men that tried to kill me, nor that the government disabled my iPhone.
Awesome stuff.

Went back to Shenendehowa IMS to get the hotspot... However, by the time I got back there...?
The last woman was leaving... And she basically said “Look dude, I don’t really care what ya need man... 
I got places to be... Know what I’m sayin’?”

Nah. Cause then that means my kid can’t show me his INCOMPLETE SCHOOLWORK cause I’ve got no INTERNET, cause 
the INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER was ALLOWING MY SERVICE TO BE DISRUPTED. So for instance...

Imagine if you would, that Kristin Johnson and I actually started banging it out in her office.
Well, a SERVICE DISRUPTION is a lot like me, pulling my dick ALL THE WAY OUT...? And then, just being a 
REAL PRICK, and make her wait a moment... wait till she says “What the hell, why’d you stop...?”

Well, that’s basically the same thing that kept happening to my internet that I was EXPECTED TO PAY FOR.
SORRY IF I’M BEING PRETTY VULGAR IN MY LANGUAGE, and my ANALOGIES…
But frankly, I don’t fucking care if I offend this bitch. I really do not give a flying fuck.

I have a video of the hardware being ATTACKED.
Sorry I had to use such a COLORFUL METAPHOR... but I have a feeling that the next time this lady sees me, 
she is gonna think twice about saying or doing anything to piss me off even more than she already has.

Cause she might actually apologize. For being an asshole. And then, ask me to unzip my pants or something.
If she apologizes, then fine.

I wound up going to the district office at 5 Chelsea Place, and vented my frustrations with the secretary 
at the counter, who was able to submit the ticket FOR me, for the hot spot. I can’t remember if that was 
the same day or not.

What I DO specifically remember about June 13th, 2020, was that my children were complaining about having 
no internet. And, I understood what the problem was, they didn’t have anything to do. I kept arguing with
my mother, and stepfather, about how the (2) guys tried to kill me outside of COMPUTER ANSWERS which is my 
OLD JOB where I was VICTIMIZED… so, I wasn’t DELUDING MYSELF. 

They didn’t get it, I WAS ALMOST MURDERED, I even told them that I had aFEAR that I would GO MISSING and 
NEVER BE FOUND, and THAT IS WHY I KEPT GETTING PISSED OFF AT THEM.

I wasn’t really pissed off at my children at all, however, my son was lying to me about a number of things.
Eventually, my mother and I were arguing outside, to the point where Bill Moak had to tell me through his 
window, that he’d prefer to shove a dildo in his asshole in peace… 

I didn’t realize how inconsiderate I was being. I was inconveniencing everyone around me with this 
“government disabled my iPhone during a murder attempt” gag.

Well, I didn’t realize that my argument with (2) elderly adults that each have a serious case of brain 
damage, means that I have to suddenly respect them when they consistently disrespect ME, and teach my kids 
to start lying.

“Oh, my bad Bill, I didn’t mean to interrupt your asshole-stuffin’-funtime-magic-show.”
It’s not what I actually said, nor what he was doing, to be fair.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Bill  : OoOOOoooHHHhhhHh who cares if your mother is wrong, you need to show some respect~!
Me    : Hey Bill...?
Bill  : *eyebrows up* 
Me    : Do yourself a favor, and shut the fuck up.
        Thanks.
Janet : Hey pal~! We’re havin’ this conversation through the kitchen window, and we are SOOOO gonna lie to 
        the police, so you better fuckin’ watch your mouth.
        *making gestures with her hands* You’re all talk and no action anyway...
Me    : Hey Janet, remember when I did your husband a `$600 job, and even like, saved him from spending `$400
        when I said “Buy this BIOS battery, and I’ll install it for ya...”
Janet : Nah, can’t say that I’d ever admit to receiving about `$1000 of money that YOU saved us from 
        having to spend.
Me    : Nah, I know, that’s because when you do favors for people, people fuckin’ forget that shit.
Janet : Shouldn’t bring up the past like that... All talk, no action.
Me    : You really are a cunt, you know that...?
        *everybody makes an audible gasp*
Bill  : I’m just lettin’ ya know through my kitchen window...? 
        I’m gonna fuckin’ kill ya 
Me    : Bill, go take a Midol already, will ya...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Little did I realize, that Bill was actually full of adrenaline, and he grabbed an aluminum baseball bat out 
of ‘fear’ and decided to hit the side of his trailer in ‘fear’ and then RUN ONTO MY PROPERTY and charge at 
me, without taking a single moment to reflect on how many crimes this man was in the middle of committing~!
This dude got pretty fuckin’ close, and I was just standing there thinking:

“There’s no way this old fuck is gonna run that whole distance without getting winded, right?” (← FALLACY ALERT*)
Nah, Bill actually ran pretty fast. Onto my property. When I was standing next to my porch. And my house. 
On my property. So like, Janet Moak, Bill Moak, and Michael Streeter committed several felonies that day.

(* FALLACIOUS statement, but since it was phrased as a QUESTION, it means it is a NOT a FALLACY at all)

The first charge: felony is ATTEMPTING TO ASSAULT ME WITH A BASEBALL BAT
The second charge: felony is PROVIDING FALSE TESTIMONY ON A WRITTEN INSTRUMENT
the third charge: misdemeanor is TRESPASSING
But amazingly, if I fuckin call 911, and I know for a fact that SCSO recorded that god damn 911 call...?
oOoOOooOhhhHhh Well, some fuckface that runs SCSO will leave that 911 call transcription out of my FOIL 
request. COOL. Then when Mark Sheehan shows up, he will take everybody else’s statement FIRST, before 
talking to the guy that called 911.

I realize the world is not full of a lot of intelligent people... Because, who knows.
I’m sure there are intelligent people SOMEWHERE.

I volunteered to get a psych evaluation because I couldn’t convince any of the morons around me, to take 
a good hard look at the evidence I was able to get off of my device BEFORE it was disabled by the 
manufacturer.

I’m not like making this up here, nobody cared to look at the pictures, STILL.

Check this out... Mark Sheehan was actually pretty cool to talk to, but- doesn’t change the “aftertaste” 
of reading that fuckin’ report at all, which I will put his statement in at the tail end of this day. 
Nah, what the report says is that my 911 call...? Never occurred~! Why is that...? A cocksucker at SCSO.

Seriously. My 911 call...? The actual REAL REASON why the fuckin’ police came there to begin with...? Oh. 
THAT specific 911 call transcription that CAUSED Mark Sheehan to show up to begin with, oh. That call has 
been omitted every fucking time... and denied. 

Gee, I wonder why? Is it cause there’s a moron in charge of SCSO?

201 HALFMOON CIRCLE (Nah, actually that was 200 Halfmoon Circle you responded to first) for a reported 
disturbance and a male subject with a bat (WILLIAM MOAK).

Upon arrival there were multiple subjects in front of lot 200 and 201D. There was no disturbance at this time.
(Instead of speaking with the CALLER FIRST) I was advised by Mike Streeter that the caller Mike Cook was have

| - SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER MR. MUELLER called US, recommended getting a HOTSPOT @ SHEN IMS ON CAMPUS          |

| - WHEN I GOT TO SHEN IMS some lady IMS was super unhelpful, and told me to submit a ticket through my kid’s  |

COOK took offense to this and walked toward MOAK, his wife and granddaughter shouting obscenities. 

In “fear”, MOAK picked up a bat and told COOK not to talk to his family like that and leave the lot. 
The two lots are in very close proximity to one another. 
All three of the parties interviewed stated that MOAK never made a threat to use the bat, he was just...
...holding it.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
| Note: Uh no I didn’t. If you want to consider the fact that I was RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE, of having an ARGUMENT |
| with my MOTHER and STEPFATHER on MY FRONT LAWN...? I didn’t actually APPROACH BILL MOAK, at all. Nah.        |
|                                                                                                              |
| Here’s what it looks like when a guy like me has to tell MARK SHEEHAN, and MICHAEL ZURLO to STEP ASIDE so    | 
| that an actual EXPERT can explain “How it went down...”                                                      |
|                                                                                                              |
| 01) I told BILL MOAK: “Shut the fuck up, and mind your own business.”                                        |
| 02) JANET MOAK stuck HER head up against the SCREEN MESH of their KITCHEN WINDOW, and SAID TO ME while I was | 
|     STILL STANDING ON MY FRONT LAWN... “You’re all talk and no action.” while making hand puppet gestures.   |
|     I WAS actually pretty offended by THAT because...                                                        |
| 03) His cunt wife forgot about the `$1000 worth of work I did for her husband, and the `$200 discount for the  | 
|     laptop that I sold him at COMPUTER ANSWERS with DATA TRANSFER, LOOKIN’ OUT FOR HIM. Cool.                | 
| 04) I said to her “Cool, thanks for your input, ya fuckin’ cunt.” since calling someone a CUNT isn’t against | 
|     the law or anything like that. Probably SOUNDS illegal...? But, only MORONS think that.                  |
|                                                                                                              |
|     The reason being, there’s a document called “The Constitution of the United States of America”...        |
|     ...it allows someone to LEGALLY call their neighbor’s wife, a CUNT, ESPECIALLY if she is BEING one.      |
|     Or, LEGALLY call anyone in the GOVERNMENT, a TREASONIST, ESPECIALLY if they are BEING one.               |
|     “Legally” being the key term there, for any lawyer out there.                                            |
|                                                                                                              |
| 05) BILL MOAK thought that calling his wife JANET MOAK a CUNT (for BEING ONE) was actually ILLEGAL for me to | 
|     DO (it isn’t) and THEREFORE, BECAUSE HE IS A FUCKING MORON... TOOK IMMEDIATE OFFENSE (fine)              |
| 06) BILL MOAK then stated through his KITCHEN WINDOW “I’m gonna fuckin’ kill ya’” (not fine OR legal) while  | 
|     I was still standing on my front lawn. (which means, he threatened to come onto my property and kill me, | 
|     just so any actual law man who reads this, can discern the crimes that transpired...)                    |
| 07) I was actually impressed, cause I really thought he was having a MENTAL EPISODE to say those words.      |
| 08) I was so impressed, that I walked onto my porch, and was ABOUT to go inside and call 911, when BILL MOAK | 
|     said something to get my attention, and then he smacked the side of HIS TRAILER, with the BASEBALL BAT   | 
|     that he SUPPOSEDLY grabbed in ‘fear’, when in reality he grabbed it in ‘frustration’ because he just…    | 
|     “made an explicitly stated threat to kill me from inside his house through his kitchen window to ME, as  | 
|     I was standing ON MY FRONT LAWN…” BILL MOAK HAD NO SENSE OF FEAR AT ALL, THEY ALL LIED.                  |
| 09) I walked down the steps because I was about to rip the baseball bat from his hands and beat him to death | 
|     on my lot, which- would’ve been [100% LEGAL*], since [HE HAD INDICATED AN INTENT TO KILL ME WITH IT*].   |
|     This process is actually referred to as “SELF DEFENSE”                       (← Non-peaceful resolution) |
| 10) My stepfather and JANET MOAK decided to INTERVENE and RESTRAIN WILLIAM MOAK, SEVERAL FEET FROM ME, on my | 
|     lot. Not BILL MOAKs lot which is 200D…? But instead…? MY LOT, which is 201D. Totally different lots.     |
|     NONE OF THESE EVENTS actually occurred on HIS LOT, AND I STATED THESE THINGS INTO THE 911 CALL.          |
| 11) At which point, the (3) people that just committed a felony, decided to come up with a fictional account | 
|     of what they just did, because they knew I was about to call 911.                                        |
| 12) I speculate that MICHAEL ZURLO was IMMEDIATELY notified of the 911 call I, MICHAEL COOK had made, and he |
|     threw in a 911 call FOR BILL MOAK, so HE wouldn’t get in trouble.             (← OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE) |

After interviewing all the subjects, I again spoke with the caller, Cook [1]. I asked if he wanted to hurt 
himself or anyone else [2]. He stated he would like to take a “Mental Test” to prove that he is not crazy [3]. 
I explained I could facilitate a transport to Saratoga Hospital MHU for evaluation [4]. Cook was transported 
to Saratoga Hospital for a voluntary MHU evaluation without incident and turned over to Stephanie in the 
paddock [5]. Nothing further, no crimes committed [6].

| Note: MARK SHEEHAN needs to be put in check with this report, as well as his superior officer.               |
|       JOHN HILDRETH, as well as MICHAEL ZURLO.                                                               |
|       MARK SHEEHAN seems like a good dude, based on my observations.                                         |
|       JOHN HILDRETH also seems like a good dude, based on my observations.                                   |
|       MICHAEL ZURLO does NOT seem like a good dude, based on the TOTAL LACK OF OBSERVATIONS I’ve made.       |
|                                                                                                              |
| 01) He spoke to them first. He didn’t speak to me, THEN go speak with them, THEN COME BACK and speak to me,  | 
|     that’s bullshit. If he came to speak to me FIRST, then why is the FIRST sentence “STREETER SAID”…? Well, | 
|     you would be fucking absolutely AMAZED, to determine that, the reason WHY, is because I wasn’t the first |
|     party that was SPOKEN TO on MY 911 CALL THAT I MADE. Huh. How fuckin’ cool is THAT…?                     |
| 02) I had no intention of hurting anyone, but I was prepared to defend myself cause that’s the reason why I  | 
|     called 911. Where’s my 911 call transcription? Ohhhhhhhhhhhh, it WASN’T included in my fuckin’ RECORDS   |
|     REQUEST that I submitted on (09/04/20), because some people that work at the SARATOGA COUNTY SHERIFFS-   | 
|     OFFICE just so happen to be FUCKING LAZY. Weird... It SHOULD be in there, right? Because… there’s a 911  | 
|     call record in this thing for when DEBORAH ORTON came to my house (07/13/20), AFTER I went to her house  | 
|     (4) times to RETURN HER LAPTOP. But- she had her TV on, the DOOR was open, and she was REFUSING to…      |
|     answer the door. That doesn’t mean that I was taking too long to repair the device at all. I DO think    | 
|     that there’s a group of people that are telling everyone else, to do this shit. Debbie Orton WAS ABLE TO |
|     GET MY ADDRESS BECAUSE DWAYNE COONRADT GAVE IT TO HER. WOW. HOW AMAZINGLY COOL IS THAT…? ANYBODY GET IT? |
| 03) Apparently, he wrote NOTHING about the CONVERSATION that SHEEHAN AND I HAD, TO PRESS CHARGES AGAINST MY  | 
|     NEIGHBOR, WILLIAM MOAK... because [I was considering pressing charges against BILL MOAK*]. However, I    |
|     figured I’d save a lot of people a lot of time and effort by talking to a psychiatrist, not because I am |
|     crazy, but because [ALL OF THESE PEOPLE PROBABLY ARE: mother/stepfather/neighbor/his wife*].             |                  
|     THAT is why I started out by saying I think they ALL have BRAIN DAMAGE from LEAD POISONING               |
|     THAT is PROBABLY a VERY COMPELLING REASON why they ALL have a difficult time PROCESSING REASON.          |
|     They don’t realize, every time I try to explain to them how I have a COLLEGE DEGREE, and a LOT OF        |
|     EXPERIENCE, and am CERTIFIED BY MICROSOFT... I’m just consistently more intelligent than they are.       |
| 04) I am the person to suggest a voluntary mental evaluation, NOT MARK SHEEHAN.                              |
|     I didn’t expect that the psychiatrist would ALSO be a moron that commits MEDICAL FRAUD.                  |
|     The COOL thing is that I met with an ACTUAL PSYCHIATRIST after this event named SAMUAL BASTIAN.          |
|     He will probably tell people that RICHARD TODD LOEBER should probably GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND STUDY        |
| 05) During the transport, MARK SHEEHAN told me he was a PHYSICS TEACHER for 7 years, and being a sheriff was | 
|     a part-time thing for him. He also blasted some music by “Ghost Inside”. I also told him something that  | 
|     sorta caught him off guard. He thought I was actually insane or something. But- once he said something   | 
|     about being surprised about something... I told him I’m not surprised by anything anymore. 
|     He visually confirmed that he’d never heard that before, and even said he’d have to remember that one…   |
| 06) Crimes WERE in fact, committed. YOU protected some dude who tried to hurt/kill me, who I happen to be a  | 
|     father of (2) children. THEN, your department was COOL with letting CPS commit CPS fraud, and take       | 
|     custody of my children [WITH EVERYTHING BASED ON HERESAY*], AFTER I was ALMOST MURDERD by (2) dudes who  | 
|     Trooper Borden knows. Thanks a lot, dude. Glad I called the “experts” for “help”.                        |
|                                                                                                              |
| A lot of crimes were committed, actually. It’s why I’m contesting that between THIS particular record, as    | 
| well as the record that I was able to obtain after making an AUDIO RECORDING w/out SCSO Captain Jeff Brown’s | 
| KNOWLEDGE, SCSO-2020-028501, where I was charged with:                                                       |

The problem gets worse. Mark Sheehan did in fact have a pretty OK conversation with me during the transport.
When we arrived at the hospital, he stood in the triage room when the nurse took my vitals, and HIM and HER 
had some sort of “surprised look” on their faces when they saw my blood pressure. That’s because I was fuckin’ 
pissed off. I sorta remained pissed off the entire time, because the PRINCIPLE of what I experienced, just
continued to cause me ADDITIONAL DISTRESS. That’s why my blood pressure probably looked alarming.

While the dude was wheeling me in on the wheelchair from the emergency room to the mental health unit, some 
guy said something about COVID vaccines, or whatever. I said SOMETHING about how fucked up his comment was, 
and he said “Nah, you don’t want to make a CURE for something, because then you make LESS MONEY off of it.” 
Cool. ^ That’s why America is full of (morons/problems). Basically, people don’t want to ADMIT that MONEY is
MORE IMPORTANT than PEOPLE...? But, they constantly treat it as such. That’s why 19 kids and 2 teachers get
shot in these fuckin’ rampages like in Uvalde. People HAVE NO MORALITY ANYMORE.

Upon my arrival, I was told that I had to wait till the following day, to talk with the doctor. Which, fine. 
I started reading William Gates: “The Road Ahead”, (1995). 
It’s how I learned how William “keyboard destroyer” Gates, would destroy everybody that ever lived, at some 
fuckin’ poker, while making a game out of how few classes he could attend at Harvard, while doing the least 
amount of studying, and getting the highest grade possible. That’s (pretty fuckin’ cool/something I would do).

Gates also wrote some stuff about the “information superhighway”, which basically became the internet. 
I think he was REALLY talking about fiber-optic cables and fast internet. Which, many of his predictions 
were spot on. Regardless, I didn’t finish the book, but I remember him talking about Kyocera, and making 
deals with people and basically being a badass that wrote BASIC with a blindfold on, backwards, upside down, 
can’t see the keyboard... dude got it done. 

What the fuck, dude. Him and Paul Allen basically cleaned house for like 30 years straight. 
He met Steve Ballmer at some supermarket or something, and Ballmer was mad good at calculus or math.
Ballmer wound up being Gates’ successor, after Windows XP was released.

Anyway, the next day after I got to the hospital, Dr. Richard Todd Loeber has a 5 minute conversation with 
me that felt a lot like I was talking to my MOTHER or my STEPFATHER.

Basically, Dr. Loeber, sorta sounded like he should probably go back to medical school and put some thought 
into his field of study. Here’s why...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Me     : A couple dudes tried to kill me, back on 05/26/2020
Loeber : That sounds like you’re having delusions, though...
Me     : Whoa. 
         Holy shit man... 
         ...do you know what separates delusions from cocksuckers like you, though...?
Loeber : *shakes his head* Shouldn’t be usin’ that kind of language, buddy... 
         That’s indicative right there...
Me     : Nah, listen cocksucker. 
         I have evidence of this shit. 
         It actually exists on my GOOGLE DRIVE ACCOUNT.
         With TIMESTAMPS and stuff.
         I have pictures of these dudes, man. 
         I tried to show the police officer that first showed up.
         My phone was dead.
Loeber : Alright, suppose this “GOOGLE DRIVE ACCOUNT” does in fact, “exist”... 
         ...how does that help your “argument”...?
Me     : Buddy, you’re already startin’ to aggravate me with the “air quotes”.
Loeber : Hey man... 
         I don’t know what else to say, what about your family history...?
Me     : Uh, well...
         ...my father was murdered when I was 10 years old. 
         My uncle seems to think he MAY have had bipolar schizophrenia.
Loeber : That’s just it right there, man.
Me     : ...what?
Loeber : Classic text-book case, of bipolar schizophrenia.
Me     : Nah, listen man, is there a REAL doctor here...?
         Cause, you sound like a fuckin’ moron that needs to go back to school.
         That condition doesn’t even exist.
Loeber : Look, I feel slightly threatened by your demeanor right now...
Me     : You probably suck some dudes dick right after you get out of the hospital every day, don’t ya...?
Loeber : This conversation is over...
Me     : Alright, well, when can I see a real doctor...? 
         Cause I’m just gonna spend the whole time telling everybody that you’re a cocksucker, alright...

I told him about how a couple dudes tried to kill me, and without even asking if I had proof or whatever, 
he expedites his ‘diagnosis’. What I’ve come to find, is that MOST DOCTORS commit MEDICAL FRAUD. 

They don’t even CARE if you catch them in the act, because they’re not getting paid a lot if they know 
that OBAMACARE/AFFORDABLE CARE ACT insurance is covering the visit. This BILL actually caused a SEVERE 
DROP IN QUALITY OF CARE. Now, it’s standard industry practice... to just bullshit their way through every 
visit a patient makes, and that’s when MOST of them BLATANTLY COMMIT MEDICAL FRAUD. 

This has even happened with ERIC SCHNACKENBERG, my normal doctor. 
My former doctor, JOHN LEN told me that he doesn’t make anything off of it, but he would still see me.
In other words, they pretend like they’re getting `$0 for you to be there. 

JOHN LEN doesn’t commit MEDICAL FRAUD, AND has more experience than this dipshit ERIC SCHNACKENBERG, or 
RICHARD TODD LOEBER. Even, DR. SAMI at ALBANY MEDICAL CENTER. Back in 2016, I was transported to ALBANY 
MEDICAL CENTER from 17 CORPORATE WOODS on MAY 18/19th 2016, where I remained for 11, full, entire, 24-hour, 
back-to-back “days” in the hospital, because I had a SEVERE INFECTION in my SPINAL COLUMN resultant of a
CORTISONE INJECTION that I received about a half mile away from Saratoga Hospital in February 2016 when I
was “dating” AMBER BURDO... 

DR. SAMI didn’t notice it NOR test for it until the 3rd fucking day that I was there. COOL. 
That’s why doctors are careless.

Yeah, a lot of doctors don’t like being told that they’re fuckin’ careless. Sometimes you SHOULD be able 
to ASSAULT them for being as careless as they are. But, then that’d be REAL bad, cause... they’d have to 
go see a DIFFERENT doctor, to like... get a CAST, or like, FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION SURGERY... for like, 
BEING A CARELESS ASSHOLE. But hey- you really aren’t even ALLOWED to make these dudes shit their pants 
in fear, when you tell em stuff like “the truth”. Ya know? If you tell a doctor that he is a careless 
asshole, when he hasn’t even given you a BLOOD TEST when you’re in the hospital for 3 fucking days...?
Well, I think that the doctor has earned himself the right, to be told what a careless asshole he is.
Ya know...?

Anyway, I was stuck there for a couple more days, and I got out on the 16th.

$Book.AddSection(8,"June 16th, 2020",@"
When I was released, I went home, and that’s when things started to get progressively worse, and FAST.
You see, I didn’t realize that every single time I said words to people...? They thought that I suddenly 
learned how to speak Chinese, and THAT’S why they couldn’t understand. Everybody thought I was speaking a 
totally different language. Not even like actual Chinese either, just another version of English where they 
can’t understand the words I say. Same words, same language, but somehow... they thought it was Chinese, and 
so they just wrote whatever.

So, if I say “My neighbor came onto my property and attempted to hit me with his baseball bat...?”
They immediately convert that statement into “Oh, he’s delusional and can’t make sense of what he’s saying.”
I don’t know if they’re doing this intentionally, or if they really are that stupid. 
It’s really too tough to tell.

I really don’t think that a guy like Mark Sheehan failed to understand what I was saying... 
Cause I mean, the guy said he was a physics teacher for 7+ years.
Listens to the type of music I’m into, and had some music on by a band named “Ghost Inside”
They’re quite similar to “As I Lay Dying”, “Bullet For My Valentine”, or even “August Burns Red”.
MAYBE they’re more like “Through the Eyes of the Dead”, or like, “Hatebreed”... ya know...? 
I’m just saying, I’m not fuckin’ speaking Chinese at all. 

When he heard me speak...? Well, I know for a fact, that the man understood what I was saying, because we 
were talking the whole way up to the hospital... 

But- I think the REAL problem, is that my 911 call transcription was left out of my records request...
...cause some cocksucker name MICHAEL ZURLO keeps doing this shit to me...
...that’s why it’s such a consistent theme with SCSO... 
...pertinent details, and case files are being INTENTIONALLY WITHHELD...
...whereby making ME look like a total fuckin’ loose cannon. 

That’s not a real fair assessment to make, because if anything, I consider myself to be quite a “very 
controlled cannon”, not a “loose cannon”. So, maybe it’s worth mentioning that I think BRUCE TANSKI is 
literally bending MICHAEL ZURLO over, and doing the EXACT SAME THING, to him, that Exxon Mobil is doing to 
Ted Cruz’s asshole.

That means, swap MICHAEL ZURLO in with Ted Cruz’ “fantasy” earlier in the document, and then imagine the 
Saratoga County Sheriff, getting fucked in the ass, right next to his son Paul. Cool.

I think that accurately sums up why SCSO seemingly has this dark fuckin’ cloud following me around.

I am hyperbolizing this shit, by a fair amount. 
What I’m NOT hyperbolizing, is that is the CORRECT PERCENTAGE of TRANSLATION that occurs.
I’m not fucking kidding about that, that is EXACTLY the CORRECT PERCENTAGE of TRANSLATION that occurred, when 
LISA MENTES submitted her petition to FAMILY COURT.

Later on after 8 or 9PM, I went to see my friend Phil. He’s cool. I occasionally will chill with friends and 
just talk about a bunch of shit, and then tell people how real I keep it.

On my way BACK...? I saw JUSTIN BELLEVILLE, behind the COUNTER, inside the BANK, and he had CASH DRAWERS 
IN HIS HANDS. When I say that...? I’m not hyperbolizing that. Literally saw this dude, INSIDE THE BANK, and it
fuckin’ looked EXACTLY like he was moving money around INSIDE THE BANK, after hours. He might’ve been doing
that LEGALLY, but I knew after working at KeyCorp, NOBODY IS ALLOWED IN THE BANK BY THEMSELVES, EVEN WITH 
PREAUTHORIZATION. The reason I knew it was Justin Belleville, is because I fuckin’ saw the dudes face. And, 
his red car too.

I didn’t call the incident in to KeyCorp Security THAT NIGHT, but I did either the next day or whenever... 

About 7-8 minutes after I walked past the bank, SCSO Sedan 4148 passes me, and hits its brake lights slightly 
after realizing it’s me walking on the side of the road. I don’t know what the reason was, that the police 
officer chose to stop in the middle of route 9, with his turn directional on, ABOUT to turn into Parkwood 
plaza. Then, he doesn’t turn. He just sits there, having a little showdown with me. 

Well, my fight or flight response engaged at that moment, because if that dude was gonna issue me a citation?
He wouldn’t have sat there in the middle of the road like he did, for like 20 solid seconds. Nah. 

People should take notice of that. 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Person : Cops don’t just sit there in the middle of the road STARING at people...
Me     : That’s right.
Person : So why would you tell people this bullshit story...?
Me     : Oh, it’s not a bullshit story at all.
         He was staring at me and trying to scare the shit out of me, because he wasn’t a real cop.
Person : That doesn’t make any sense, you’re contradicting yourself.
Me     : Nah, I’m just a LOT more intelligent than most people.
Person : I don’t understand...
Me     : The COP that I saw sitting in the middle of Route 9...?
         Might’ve been a FAKE cop car, painted like one, decals, lights, equipment to make it look like
         a legitimate police car...?
         But- then another police officer like Mark Sheehan will say 
         “We don’t have a police vehicle with that number...”
         Ohhhhhhhh...
         So that means it’s not a real cop car.
Person : That’s impossible, then they would get pulled over.
Me     : Nah, you see, that’s why I happen to BE far more intelligent than most people.
         I don’t say shit like “that’s impossible”, unless it really truly is impossible.
         MOST PEOPLE confuse the terms “that’s impossible” with “that’s HIGHLY improbable”.
         I consider that MAYBE what I’m looking at, is RARE FOR ANYONE TO EVER NOTICE.
Person : I highly doubt that a cop would just SIT THERE, for like, 20 full seconds in the middle of Route 9.
Me     : Oh, I got ya. 
         You’re not getting’ it though.
         Fake cop car pulled off a heist at Key Bank, about 7-8 minutes before I saw this “cop car”. 
         That’s why the “non-real cop” was staring at me.
         Looked like an actual cop...?
         Acted very SIMILAR to a real cop...?
         Probably had the SAME TRAINING...?
         Probably had the DEALERSHIP that SERVICES ACTUAL POLICE VEHICLES brew up an EXTRA car, on the side.
         For instance, could’ve been FABRICATED by GOLDSTEIN.
         And then OCCASIONALLY, it’ll get driven around alongside a team of fraud artists, like the guys at 
         Center for Security, and the FBI and the State Police, and SCSO... and they’ll work together stealing
         money from regular, every day citizens that do all the “work”.
         Just corrupt people at the FBI, KeyCorp, SCSO, all “looking the other way”.
         Nobody notices a thing, because that’s how slick these people are.
Person : That’s just... you need to be on medication or somethin’ buddy, don’t you think somebody would’ve 
         done something by now, if that were the case...?
Me     : You keep referencing these FALLACIOUS STATEMENTS.
         Someone DID notice it by now, and they’re working REALLY HARD to keep it a fuckin’ SECRET.
         Such a WELL KEPT SECRET, that they will literally try to kill me for being this accurate.
         THEY HAVE ALREADY TRIED NUMEROUS TIMES.
Person : … (← this is the response I get from people when they realize I’m a lot smarter than people think)

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

It was the WAY that his vehicle was just sitting there, and this dude was just staring at me through his rear 
view mirror. As soon as we “broke” this little staring contest, he pulled back onto route 9 as if he said:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Fake Cop : Fuck it… I’m not turning LEFT into Parkwood Plaza. 
           Instead...?
           I’m gonna fuckin’ swing around in Astoia Vucetic’s driving range property parking lot. 
           Like a god damn ninja bro. 
           Just like RYAN WARD taught me to do.
           Dude’s tougher than fuckin’ nails...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

I was actually highly impressed with the way that this dude managed to perform such an amazing 180, I almost 
stuck around and shat my pants, but then I said to myself: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Me : Nah... 
     I get the feeling I’m a fuckin’ dead man if I don’t lose this guy.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

So, that’s what I did. I had a “feeling”, that I was gonna get myself shot SOMEHOW, because of the Facebook 
post that earned me 30-day ban. After I got home, I started pounding out a new document. I wrote up about 
some stuff regarding Deputy Pirrone, DJ Thompson, John Hoffman, Saratoga Hospital I believe, and I named 
one of the documents Officer 4184. Looked nearly IDENTICAL to an ACTUAL SCSO cruiser, being driven by an 
ACTUAL cop... but- when I went to speak with G. Gurney at the Halfmoon Sheriff Substation, I gave him that 
plate number, and he said “That vehicle would’ve been driven by a particular person... but he doesn’t work 
the night shift.”

OOOooooohhhhhhhhhh that’s why I’m smarter than everyone at the Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office.
I’m probably not smarter than everybody at SCSO, cause the prick that works with them is a Russian 
intelligence officer, and they’ve been stealing information from people in the US for a very long time.
And that dude, is actually terrified that I’m gonna catch him now. Which is why he’s ready to kill me.
It’s probably not even just SCSO, I mean, what if HALF of ALL cop cars, are driven around by a legitimate
police officer who is casually leaking everything to people somewhere else in the world, and then they ALL 
steal money from EVERY bank, and like, nobody ever notices, cause... how could they...?

People are busy sitting there judging me ASSUMING that I’m coming up with TALL TALES, right...?
They’re not tall tales. Someone is definitely doing this shit, I’ve seen it with my own god damn eyes.
They started TARGETING ME, because of the News 10 report, probably. 

It’s why I can write up a document about Russian spies, and even how the chick on “The Americans” reminds 
me of Kristen Stangle, right...? And everyone will think “Oh, he’s just insane, because there’s no way 
Russians do this shit to America.” Nah yeah, there is a way, actually. I have to insult people when they 
try to tell me that I’m insane when I’m still holding onto PROOF.

See, I wrote about a cool little joke where I fuckin’ somehow have a superhuman ability to lunge at people 
from a FULL ENTIRE FOOTBALL FIELD AWAY, dodging bullets like Neo does in the movie the Matrix. Even though 
that’s impossible...? Some people took that shit seriously. 

The PEOPLE who take that shit SERIOUSLY...? There’s a VERY HIGH PROBABILITY THAT THEY ARE GUILTY.

The ol’ Pickett go-to, dude was lunging at ya from an entire football field away. 
That’s when they had no choice, but to whip out their sidearm, and start firing. 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/    

Cop : That’ll show you, ya fuckin’ smartass. 
      *shakes head* Dude's gonna lunge at me from an entire football field away...?
      *scoffs* Unbelievable.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

They’ll say that I made that choice. I didn’t make a choice at all. I had no choice but to fly from one point 
of the road, to a fuckin’ full mile away, sometimes even (5). 
How...? Who fuckin’ cares. 
Who REALLY gets to decide on what, buddy...? 
Flying full lengths of entire buildings is not 1) OK, 2) legal, OR 3) possible.
Nope. So, naturally, they will arrest you for even THINKIN’ about doin’ that.
Describing it, is a LOT more than just thinkin’ about it...

The problem is, some people took that seriously. That’s because they’re not intelligent people.
People who don’t find what I said to be very hilarious...?
They’re EITHER morons, or they’re doing heinous shit and they don’t want to get caught.
So, if it sounds HILARIOUS and PEOPLE       LAUGH → innocent.
    If it sounds HILARIOUS and PEOPLE DON’T LAUGH → stupid or guilty, or both. (probably not both, though)

Like, not only is it against the law to DO that...? 
But it’s also against the laws of physics too... 
So if you go ahead and do that...? Well, now you’re REAL fucked, dude.

I think that Eric Schnakenberg probably took that entire story literally. I think a lot of people were 
SUPPOSEDLY ‘worried about my mental health’ which was doing just fine, believe it or not. The people that 
were ‘worried about my mental health’ need to worry about ‘going to prison soon’.

I just had a traumatic run in with a fuckin’ rogue-FBI man who has a hobby that he does in his off time, 
that just so happens to be a lot like Dexter from Showtime. I really don’t know if he uses the saran wrap 
or whatever, but holy fuck. I am pretty sure that he’s basically an anesthesiologist. 
Such a little prick, nobody (knows what hit em/feels it).

Yeah, this dude doesn’t play around. My cousin Ryan Ward, is the guy people would want to be trained by,
if they think they’ve got what it takes to be the best there is, at everything. Not even playin’ games...
Dude knows the ins and outs of how to skull-fuck opponents. Except me.

Not gonna rub Shnck’s nose in his own shit pile... but, some people don’t realize that I’m a lot smarter than 
most people think. I didn’t do all that well in school because I was traumatized by the death of my father,
and the emotional abandonment of my mother, and the dysfunctional relationship we had thereafter. 

But once I really apply myself, I will outperform everyone. My father was the same way, that’s why he earned a 
perfect score on his ASVABS military entrance exam. John Pickett and Scott Salvadore heard me say that on 
Facebook way back around April 2019 when I manipulated all of Scott Salvadore’s 1) friends, 2) family, to try 
and beat me at a game they kept failing to win at... and that’s called “one-upping me”.

Top deck awareness, all day, every day... you get what you see, and you see what you get...
What you see is what you get. 
Sometimes, you’ll also get an additional thing you already got, after it’s been given and then taken back.
If it sounds confusing... that’s cause I’m trying to throw the concept of quantum mechanics into (1) sentence.

They’ll think that I’m being serious when I’m kidding around. 
Some people KNOW I’m kidding around and they FORCE themselves to say: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Person : There’s NO WAY this guy could POSSIBLY be kidding around right now... 
         Cause, that shit he just said, would ACTUALLY make me laugh if I thought this dude was COOL... 
         But- since THIS GUY said it...? 
         *shakes head* Fuck you, pal...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

I’m sorta kidding. These guys know when I write something funny, they have to use some means of minimizing 
my exposure to other people, because of how COOL/FUNNY they KNOW I am, and they have to work OVERTIME to keep 
me contained. I’m not exaggerating that. 

Therefore, I’m being censored because I’m embarrassing people with my first amendment right to free speech.

I recorded a video of my attempt to extract some files from my secondary storage drive that I am well aware, had
some type of “flag” in it, which means that if a specific file or folder is flagged, it will cause the folder to 
load its content more slowly than it normally would. That’s cause a cocksucker flagged it, remotely.

| 06/17/20 | RICO (explorer.EXE “Process injection”) | https://youtu.be/OJVgZ2eztjc |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Anyway, the above video was originally recorded on that particular date, and surprisingly, it is the reason 
WHY the SARATOGA COUNTY CHILDRENS PROTECTIVE SERVICES was ordered to do what it did. Because the EVIDENCE that 
is SEEN in the VIDEO, is DAMAGING to SOMEONE ELSES CREDIBILITY, because…? Now I know that the government is 
PROTECTING the guys that attempted to murder me on 05/26/20. The particular exploit which causes an ERROR that
says “explorer.EXE”…? That is a HACKING TOOL that is performing a thing called PROCESS INJECTION.

Process injection, is basically when a legitimate process is INJECTED WITH MALICIOUS CODE. 
It is QUITE ADVANCED, and it is something that the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY would USE. 
However, it is ALSO something that the KGB may even use, as well. 
Really, it could be my OWN countrymen doing this shit to me, or not. But, I think it is both.

I was able to deduce that I have varying versions of files from May 23rd, 2020 when I was walking through
Jonesville... They spliced (2) different files together as the same file, and I’m fairly certain it wasn’t 
accidental. That’s the issue...

I’ve been able to determine that some ACCIDENTAL things, aren’t actually accidental at all. 
Since everyone else seems to believe that accidents happen, whaddya gonna do...?

Well, they won’t understand the concept of how some things are NOT accidental in the least. 
They will APPEAR to be accidental, but then I experience a secondary manner of communication that is 
based on barometric pressure.

Because I spend like an hour typing up a shit-storm in the video I recorded, AND, I prefer to have longer 
“session” based recordings so that people aren’t like: 
“OooOOooOOohhHhhh you fuckin’ edited the video bro, totally fake...~!” 

Nah, I have a video that shows some shit happening in Jonesville, the blurriness of the camera lens as a 
blue car drives by, and then the different file sizes of the videos, and then I recorded a video of the 
desktop as I was attempting to play the footage. 

These people really are working incredibly hard to manufacture evidence and frame me, they’ve done such an
amazing job that KRISTIN JOHNSON and LAURA HUGHES will be the first people to admit that they fucked up, 
because they don’t want to go to jail for being “CARELESS”.

They were attempting to prevent me from extracting a specific video file from my secondary hard drive. 
Also, there was a PROCESS INJECTION for explorer.EXE instead of explorer.exe, which became like a dead 
giveaway that Picheljitsu may have been involved in that somehow – or at the very least, a technique I 
learned from him was actually being used by SOMEBODY with a LOT more skill, than anybody at Computer Answers 
or Nfrastructure. 

The difference between the two, is that the last 3 letters are “exe” and then “EXE”, which means that 
it’s not the DEFAULT process. It’s a SWAPPED IN process, which is something that Microsoft-grade security 
engineers OR,Russian CYBERCRIMINALS and ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT groups would use, to commandeer a 
given system.

I have no doubt that SOME people at Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Apple, etc., they leak information.
When I say that they “leak information”, what I mean is that they will say “WHOOPS, MY BAD BRO...” and then,
‘accidentally’ send somebody a list of stolen credit card numbers, or database logins/passwords, and then
they’re basically COMPLICIT with stuff that inevitably becomes SOLORIGATE. SOLORIGATE is also known as the 
2020 FEDERAL DATA BREACH - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach

Anyway, TROOPER BORDEN, LAURA HUGHES, KRISTIN JOHNSON, MRS. MATURA, MRS. SMITH, DR. OLIVER ROBINSON, DWAYNE
COONRADT, PAVEL ZAICHENKO, ERIC CATRICALA, BRUCE TANSKI, JOHN HOFFMAN, ERIC SCHNACKENBERG, ROBERT RYBAK, 
JAMES HUGHES, LESTER WORMUTH, KELLY WORMUTH, PAUL AMATO, KEVIN TOLLISEN, basically every name I could think 
of that is in Clifton Park, or near it, or like... I dunno. 

Clifton Park, and 100% of the people that live in it... don’t understand that I literally knew these fucks 
had this shit on my equipment, not because I’m SPECIAL or anything, but because I KNOW WHAT THE FUCK I’M 
DOING, so, when I say that...? 

People ASSUME that you gotta know a LOT of the RIGHT PEOPLE, in order for you to ACTUALLY know ANYTHING. 
That’s right… so many people in our society are FOOLS who think that’s the reality. 
But, that’s not true.
You can certainly “know the right people” and get ahead in life, but you can ALSO “be more observant than
everybody else”, and then it’s pretty easy to start detecting things that everyone is TOO LAZY to LOOK FOR.

I really don’t understand why Picheljitsu would be involved, it makes NO SENSE. As far as I know, I’ve never 
pissed in this dudes’ wheaties or anything... But he is in the United States Air Force, and he is probably a 
legitimate cybercommando. Just like Edward Snowden and JULIEN ASSANGE. Cybercommandos don’t fuck around, man.

I distinctly recall a number of events that occurred at or about the time my friend Kris Wacikowski said I 
could use his blade server around January 28th-31st 2020, and that’s about the time that I sent email to
Picheljitsu, regarding what I was workin’ on. 

I’ve been incredibly AUDIBLE and BLATANT about a lot of things, because it causes some people to notice 
that I will just keep doing that, and someone will try to get an edge on me to be a real sneaky bastard... 
...not realizing that I expect people to do that. 

Like, I don’t do it to be a moron, I do it to manipulate people that think I’m an idiot. 
I don’t think Picheljitsu has malicious intent at all.

Still, I got very side tracked. I wanted to build a utility that took Black Viper service config and 
MadBomb122’s Windows 10 optimizer, and merge them with the tools that I was already building... 

Almost like I could already be working for Microsoft and helping them do some amazing stuff with SCCM, MDT,
Autopilot, and Intune. 

Problem is, I need to finish what I started. The tool I’m building will scale multiple threads 
automatically, and basically EXPORT every single event log and event into an objectified will be very 
useful, and I did manage to get quite a bit of framework completed for it... the problem is that this
document/book has taken a higher priority, because that tool doesn’t have a lot of work left to finish... 

...and I have to make an example out of the long list of people here in my hometown that have been 
ignoring me and pretending like they don’t know I’m a lot smarter than they are. 

Now, does that make me an asshole for indicating that...?
Well, if I’m gonna be the guy that actually does the real job at protecting people from identity theft, 
and cybercrime, you can’t really depend on lazy-dicked douchebags that constantly fill out problematic 
and inaccurate reports on everything they do. So, you need someone that is a lot more intelligent than 
everybody else, so that they can give people better training. You know...?

John Hoffman has probably never had an expert like Eric Mead show him how to do an actually amazing coin 
trick. 

Bruce Tanski has probably never had an actual expert show him how to run or build his business without 
having to murder his competition, and steal their money and then hire a bunch of dudes to chase them down 
when they caught him committing fraud.

The guys that work at Center for Security have probably never once had anyone show them how to have 
integrity, and not just crack anybody’s lock or safe, and then murder people in their sleep. Nah.
(^ these guys are morons and they know I caught them, and they’re definitely fuckin’ worried.)

Paul Pelagalli probably never had someone who was skilled at being a judge, teach him how to be a good 
judge, though if he wanted to learn from someone that’s been doing this shit correctly for over 35 years, 
James Hughes would be a great start.

Laura Hughes probably never had anyone teach her how to correctly investigate somebody for child abuse.

Kristin Johnson probably never had anyone teach her how to be an actually halfway decent psychologist.

The people at SCSO like Jeff Brown, Shelley Zeitske, or MICHAEL ZURLO probably have never once had someone 
skillfully teach them how to do their job CORRECTLY, as well as how to collect evidence.
They’re actually very skilled at IGNORING stuff, and then [MANUFACTURING EVIDENCE*].

They should probably consider not doing that anymore, because even if they only do that once in a while...?
Now they have to worry about being caught.

The guys at the NYSP probably never had anybody teach them how to do their job without lying...
And to be fair...? Trooper Leavey is not on that list, and many of the troopers I’ve dealt with ARE honest.
Leavey should be the station chief of Clifton Park, cause the current one...? He’s fuckin’ lazy.

Dwayne Coonradt probably never had someone show him how to generate really high sales at Computer Answers
without lying to his customers, or stealing components from their machines to swap in bad parts and earn a
profit off of that.

In nearly every case...?
Someone has to set a better example, so that the people in the future aren’t making so many careless mistakes.
Yeah, Pelagalli is probably the one guy I have to be MOST WORRIED about, because, he doesn’t actually care if 
I have evidence of him committing a FELONY.

Nah, these people are cocky bastards, they think that they’re gonna keep committing felonies over and over 
again and never actually serve time in prison... Well, we’ll see just how long that lasts.

Because, do you think Theodore Roosevelt would stand for that shit at all...?
No. Theodore Roosevelt would knock Warren Buffett the fuck out, if he knew that Buffett was involved in 
staging a monopoly amongst several phone companies and internet providers.

James Comey probably never had an expert teach him how to do his job correctly, otherwise Clinton would’ve 
gone to prison, and Assange would’ve been released already. BARACK OBAMA, dare I say it, probably has never 
had someone teach him how to uphold the constitution at ALL times, and not make little exceptions here and 
there. Otherwise, he would’ve done something about DHS not allowing Snowden back into the country.

Will all of those statements piss these people off...?
Of course, I’m not saying these things to piss them off though.
I’m saying them because they’re obviously TRUE.

Tangential, but- actually relevant. I wrote up a document called “Secure Digits Plus” and in that 
document, I basically say a bunch of stuff, tell people how much ass I intend to kick, and that I had 
quite a story already way back when... Now look at me. I’ve taken it to a totally new level and I’m not 
just kickin’ ass and takin names, but I’m also throwing down the gauntlet, and setting up the foundation 
in which additional asses are gonna get kicked, AND, additional names are gonna be taken... when all’s 
said and done, the mightiest gauntlet of them all, will reign supreme.

In other words, I’m just trying to make things sound cooler.
The truth is, my cousin Ryan Ward might have a pencil dick... but, he’s had training at what he does best.
He’s actually highly skilled at kicking peoples asses. So, it was just me and him this whole time, knowing
that there are so many morons in the world that lack morals... And, ya know... that’s what causes people to
slip up and make so many mistakes. He’s on the other side of the coin, however.

In a world where people like John Hoffman, and Bruce Tanski are given a participation trophy for showing up?
*scoffs* Well, accuracy matters. 
Especially when it concerns digital security. 
You might have some friends in high places, but you might also know how to write your own code... 
...and configure your own equipment, like I do.

You really can’t find a single person that can perform as many roles as I can, without paying top dollar.
When I say stuff like `$175/hour, that’s my low end rate. 

You want the best there is...? Heh. 
It won’t be cheap, but it’ll still be a hell of a lot less than hiring a team of dudes.

You can’t get perfect with accuracy all the time, because that would piss everybody off.

Back in the early 1900’s, they used to have these Sherlock Holmes-like dudes, wearin’ a special hat, smokin’ 
on a pipe. Long ass trench coats for the rain. Now, look at what they’ve got. They’ve got cybercommandos that 
basically do their job for em. Once you get a few cybercommandos on deck, your job becomes a HELL OF A LOT
easier.

Anyway, the point of June 18th, 2020, was that I went to a shitload of places and visited a number of people,
and maybe the truth is a lost cause...

I was looking for ANY EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER of (SCSO-2020-028501) the (record/interaction). 
I wouldn’t get this information until speaking to (SCSO Captain Jeffrey Brown) in February 2021. 
So basically, I requested records, and, I didn’t get the main record I was looking for. 
I was offered an ACOD on cutting the STRAP, and nobody got arrested for almost murdering me.
(SCSO James Leonard) decided to ignore numerous crimes committed against me.  Why...? 

It’s cause he’s a moron. Just so we’re clear, a moron is someone who TRIES to be intelligent and fails.

Well, SCSO has a habit of doing this in some cases. 
JAMES LEONARD chose to FRAME ME, for cutting a KAYAK STRAP at (05/26/20 0545), almost as if the facts don’t 
actually matter. So, if the facts don’t matter, then why was I charged with a CRIME that doesn’t matter...? 
Is it because MAYBE there’s a fuckin’ moron who ORDERED Deputy Martin to perform this arrest...? 

Yeah. That is what happened. Not just (1) moron, but MULTIPLE MORONS.
You really have to be concerned about MULTIPLE MORONS joining forces like VOLTRON does.
Or, that skit “Power Falcons” from Key and Peele.

I mean, that’s what it fuckin’ looks like to me, right there. (5) dudes that I think are DIRECTLY involved.
Might be thousands that are indirectly involved. The Pickett’s weren’t involved in this ticket at all.
Nah, if they’re gonna do anything that’s not by the book, it’ll still be done with far more class.

[TANSKI, BRUCE]: just thinks I’m an annoying prick, but I was watching him for many years.
I became MORE suspicious after I saw the (broken fiber optic cable: https://youtu.be/zs0C_ig-4CQ)
I really don’t think WNYT is doing anything shady. I think that’s the issue with a lot of my content, I’ll
SAY something that’s probably not very ACCURATE, right...? And then people won’t pay any attention to the 
thing I recorded in the VIDEO that is pretty fuckin’ spot on. That’s ok. It allows me to just keep doing it
right in plain sight, practically undetected. I say practically because it probably doesn’t FEEL like I keep
‘accidentally’ recording additional evidence.

In the video, (1) guy looks right at me, and I think he knows who was attacking my cable modem over and over.
I’d really like to get a COURT SUBPOENA for that dude who was texting somebody, and looking RIGHT AT ME, 
Cause, I’m fairly certain he was texting someone at the FBI that was behind the ATTACKS to my CABLE MODEM a
WEEK EARLIER. Probably ALSO ATTACKING ME when I managed COMPUTER ANSWERS, and then AFTERWARD.

I went and spoke to these guys and not (1) dude there knew how much their fastest service was.
But, suppose that all 10 of those trucks were Spectrum trucks sometimes, and then they just flip the 
magnets over that say SPECTRUM, so then they’ll all say VERIZON...? 
I mean, quite literally, what is happening, is VERIZON is making SPECTRUM gag on a big fat dick, right...? 
And because my analogy is quite COMPELLING, people will get offended by it... 
...but nobody really stops and asks me “Is that why does my service sucks so much dick all the time...?”
Yeah. It is. It is the reason why your INTERNET SERVICE by SPECTRUM sucks so much dick ALL the time.

If you had FIOS, you would INSTANTLY HAVE a WAY BETTER UPLOAD SPEED (which is great for when you want to 
upload files at the same speed as when you download them... Not already providing that SYNCHRONIZED SPEED, 
sorta means these guys suck at networking, and nothing more.

Well, it’s mainly cause they’re both owned by the same guy. 
He doesn’t like the idea of making less money. Nobody does.
Unfortunately, you have to file a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT against MULTIPLE COMPANIES at the SAME TIME, and, 
have COMPELLING EVIDENCE AGAINST ALL OF THEM, and then, INVESTIGATE THE JUDGES BEFORE DOING SO.

So then, Tanski can’t ask his buddies to help him out of a jam. Nah. 
Spectrum shouldn’t be able to pay off a Class Action Lawsuit with FREE HBO like it did LAST TIME.
Especially if the lawsuit IMMEDIATELY causes it to go BANKRUPT alongside Verizon...

Almost like `$500 billion dollars’ worth of value got wiped off of the face of the earth at the same time.
Sniping out their stocks. Strategically placed stock purchases being TRANSFERRED from THEIR bank accounts, 
and then DEPOSITED into a COMPETITOR’s, almost like you could manipulate the stock market all the time 
that way. The COMPETITOR is the one that OWNS the FIBER OPTIC CABLES. 

That means, they have the same connections that VERIZON does, and they can offer something A LOT FASTER than
the FIOS service, without even NEEDING Verizon to exist. It’s not really the SPEED that I’m worried about so 
much as the fact that there’s ACTUAL COMPETITION that keeps INCREASING the CAPABILITIES of the NETWORK.

So, back in the day, Time Warner cable constantly upgraded their network.
Almost like they saw the sense in CONSTANTLY making it FASTER/BETTER.
At some point, they decided to start gaggin’ on a big fat dick, and then they settled down and had kids.
Now they have like 12 kids, they all fuckin’ use all the hot water every morning taking showers before 
school, everybody’s miserable, whenever they eat dinner, somebody doesn’t get to eat... simply put, they 
need a BIGGER HOUSE and MORE MONEY SPENT ON FOOD/SUPPLIES/UPGRADES.

Same concept can be applied to how lazy Spectrum and Verizon are, in conjunction.
When I say LAZY, what I mean is, they fuckin’ suck ass at what they do. Constantly.
The thing is, Verizon is actually good at what they do, so if I’m saying they suck ass, it’s because they 
don’t FEEL like they have to work hard anymore. They literally have no motivation, to give a shit.
So, you have to MANIPULATE THEM, into thinking about how they’ll feel when they are flat broke.

Their lines are owned by another company. Oh wow.
A totally different company OWNS the fiber optic lines?
Verizon only RENTS those fiber optic lines...? But- I thought they all had Verizon badges on them...?
Well, some people will try to say “those aren’t Verizon stickers on those...”
Oh, no...? Pretty sure that they all say Verizon. 
That means that someone’s looking at some serious prison time.

How could it possibly go bankrupt?
WELL. Imagine if you would, that somebody flew a fuckin’ plane right into the Verizon headquarters in NYC?
Just like Verizon did to the World Trade Center.
I’m not even really being metaphorical about that, I believe that the BRITISH own fuckin’ Verizon.
And that THEY’RE the ones that attacked us on 9/11/2001.

“Keep your eyes on Verizon” was basically them cheekingly letting people know that they were about to stage 
that attack against the World Trade Center.

Hey, maybe I’m wrong about all of those things about Spectrum and Verizon... and it’s just a really clever
way for me to cause them to start thinking about offering their best service.

So, anyway... TANSKI has much smaller problems. 
So do ERIC CATRICALA, JOHN HOFFMAN, MICHAEL ZURLO, JAMES LEONARD...
...but they’re all involved in a sting operation. 
They’re all looking at some time in prison.

(^ What MARK SHEEHAN told me on 06/19/20. It’s ALSO a metaphor for Kerberos, the hound of Hades)

Tanski was able to get 1 year probation cause of how awesome he is at everything, except fooling ME.
The reason why it was such a small slap on the wrist, is because a lot of people have to be ensnared with
something that depletes their entire bank account in a single transaction. 
Not just THEIRS, but also, their buddies too. Being able to INFORM everybody about FAKE COP CARS, and 
Center for Security being SERIAL KILLERS... It’s gonna cause some people to take some fuckin’ notice.

Imagine if you would, the movie Casino, since TANSKI and PESCI act a lot alike.
Let’s say I’m somebody that wants to take down an entire Racketeer Influence Criminal Organization, right...?

Well, I wanna take out De Niro and Pesci’s entire organization, and the BEST way to do that, is to just 
PRETEND like I’m a fuckin’ moron for a while. After a while, I’ll start to introduce pieces of evidence 
that reveal WHY my iPhone 8+ was remotely disabled by an FBI man on 05/27/20 after I showed that particular 
video to NYSP TROOPER SHAEMUS LEAVEY. 

Cause, I have a feeling that was their Achilles heel to their entire operation.
BRUCE TANSKI, is VERY AWARE of this. So is JOHN HOFFMAN. So, they’re watching with great anticipation…

In order to take down the entire organization, I have to explain how many components are involved.
That means you have to catch all of the cops and the judges FIRST. 
Once you do that though...?
Then really, I guess the next move is just psychological shit to make them feel paranoid... like this book.
I’m not going to elaborate on the next several moves, but just know that it’s a game of 10 dimensional chess.

The reason why I went to the Feiden Appliance Center on June 18th, 2020, is because (SCSO-2020-003173) is 
actually a CRIME that JAMES LEONARD committed. Here’s why → 

MY VERBAL ADMISSION to CUTTING the KAYAK STRAP, did not occur AT the time they decided to STAPLE to the 
arrest report. Because, you’re supposed to use the ACTUAL TIME THAT SOMEONE WAS THERE, not just use some 
off-the-shelf paper to staple to the arrest report, because that’s not by the book.

I mean, theoretically, you could be a fuckin’ lame son of a bitch like this dude JAMES LEONARD, and do that
anyway, but then you’re committing a FELONY. MANUFACTURING EVIDENCE is a SERIOUS OFFENSE. So is IGNORING a
911 call. So, ignoring (2x) 911 calls, that’s actually a CAPITAL CRIME, bub.

That’s basically, you, and everyone involved, getting their butthole pounded out in prison for a while.
Luckily, I don’t think MARTIN or THOMPSON knew what the fuck they were getting into, and I’m not looking to
pursue charges against them. 

THE  ACTUAL TIME ISN’T EVEN ON THE ARREST REPORT. 
THE CORRECT DATE ISN’T EVEN ON THE ARREST REPORT. 
Like I said, I believe this man is an actual, moronic individual. 
I NEVER ADMITTED TO BEING THERE AT (05/26/20 0545). 
I was NOT AT THAT LOCATION AT THAT TIME.
I can actually prove what time I WAS there, believe it or not~!
Ya know...? Almost like someone has to be told over and over again, that if this document makes it to the 
correct people, then he IS going to prison. Cause it’s not just (1) incident.

(06/01/20 SCSO-2020-003173) MICHAEL O. MARTIN: (← NOT THE GUY IM PISSED AT) 
I was dispatched to 1771 US-9 in the town of Clifton Park, in regard to an ongoing issue. The complainant 
stated that he was disturbed by the Facebook posts involving the want to purchase a firearm, that had been 
posted by the suspect of an earlier complaint made by Zachary involving the strap to his kayak being cut. 
Zackary showed me the Facebook posts of the subject, Michael Cook. 

Zachary made no indication that he is NOT on Michael Cook’s Facebook friends list, which means that I am 
admitting that I am complicit with Zachary Karel STALKING Michael Cook. (← That’s what that is buddy)

Zachary made no indication that Michael Cook had severed his phone line at 130AM @ SCSO-2020-028501,
which Michael did in order to attempt establishing contact with 911 emergency services, since his 
smartphone was subjected to a CYBERATTACK known as PEGASUS/PHANTOM.
(^ Obstruction of justice, actually.)

I read through the post and determined that there were no direct threats to Zachary. However, I advised 
Zachary that if he feels unsafe because of his recent complaint involving Michael Cook, he could obtain an 
(OOP/Order of Protection) at the Saratoga County Family Court office. Zachary felt that would be a good idea. 
Zachary also requested that I make advisement to Michael, advising Michael that he is not allowed on his 
property 1769 Route 9, and his place of employment, 1771 Route 9, (even if he is attempting to collect
evidence of SCSO-2020-028501)

Deputy Thompson and I patrolled to the residence of Michael Cook at 201 D* Halfmoon Circle, in the 
Town of Halfmoon. We made contact with Michael and were engaged in a conversation regarding both ** and 
how the property owners are advising that Michael is not allowed on the properties. 

During the conversation, Deputy Thompson asked Michael “Let me ask you a straight-up question, did you cut 
the phone line at 130AM...? Because we really don’t care about the kayak strap. We wanna know if you cut
this dude’s phone line... Cause, maybe you were tryin’ to call 911 with your phone, and like, couldn’t...?”

Michael responded by having “a series of pictures we never looked at to make his case, that Zachary Karel
was in fact stalking Michael Cook.”

^ Yeah, I ad-libbed a bunch of stuff there, because these police officers were accessories to a crime that
JAMES LEONARD COMMITTED. Ya know...? Ignoring the fact that I called 911 multiple times...? But hey. Go 
right ahead and arrest me for a fuckin’ kayak strap, sorry for trying to smack some sense into JAMES LEONARD.

I wrote a pretty long winded document or two, and left them with the superintendent at 5 Chelsea Place.     
I had already left numerous documents there. I don’t know if the guy has been reading them, or not. But- 
there’s a reason why I don’t go to the police. It’s cause I had evidence of 2 dudes trying to murder me
on May 26th, 2020, right...? And then when I showed the video to NYS Trooper Shaemus Leavey, my device 
DISABLED itself, rendering everything on the device UNAVAILABLE.

Some <unspecified> decided to be a sausage wrecker, and they disabled my device remotely. People like Keila,
should consider the idea of just going right ahead, and sucking my dick already. Cause she doesn’t know what 
the fuck she’s talking about, and SOMEBODY IS TEACHING PEOPLE LIKE HER TO SAY SHIT LIKE THAT.

Which, it’s is the perfect explanation as to how Apple got to be worth `$3T, and why Tim Cook needs to 
be called out. He’s allowing the FBI or government to remotely disable a given device that they made.
Strange how he and I have the same last name, right...? No relation as far as I can tell. 

The reason why I keep making a stink about all of this, is literally because this is ME, being an EXPERT, 
trying to get HELP, from SOMEBODY, because I cannot rely on the POLICE, except like a handful of them...
I’m well past the point where I give a shit if people think I’m an asshole. I’m an expert. I’m WELL beyond 
the capabilities of MOST PROFESSIONALS. Professionals watch their language. 
Experts will be COCKY and tell you to get on your fuckin’ knees, and suck on it.

I was following up on a ticket I submitted already to get a hotspot for my kids, but at this point, I was too
frustrated by the numerous times I’d been basically undermined by everyone I run into. Seriously. I could 
tell people, “I’ve been doing this shit longer than anybody in this building, or on the Shenendehowa campus.”

Some people will agree and they know I’m correct. The rest...? They won’t realize that I’m not bullshitting 
anybody, and that I ran a computer shop for 3 years, went on the news, have certifications from Microsoft, 
used to have a mapping site on Planetquake in 2001... 
https://web.archive.org/web/20010509235518/http://www.planetquake.com/bfg20k/

So, when I tell people that I HAVE A LOT OF FUCKING KNOWLEDGE IN WHAT I TALK ABOUT… it is FUCKING ACCURATE.
Anybody can CRUISE AROUND on that particular WAYBACK MACHINE LINK I gave them, and look at how long I had 
that site, where I was posting IMAGES/UPDATES/PK3 files of what I like to refer to as 
“GRAPHIC/ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN”.

I don’t just FABRICATE shit out of thin air if I say something like that in person.
I realize that’s what people ASSUME I am doing, for instance, KRISTIN JOHNSON, didn’t get understand WHY I 
was in the position I’m in. 

Like, if she were to consider my phone being hacked by SERIAL KILLERS at the FBI...?

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Me      : Alright, can you fuckin’ make `$800 an hour...?
Johnson : Nah, that’s a lot of money...     
Me      : Yeah it is. 
Johnson : Well, why aren’t you doing that...?
Me      : Because I’m working on something a lot more important than that.
          AND, because my former employer, says a lot of shit about me to people in the community.
          Wanna know why that is...?
Johnson : ...why?
Me      : It’s because he gets a thrill out of LYING and ALMOST making half of the money I brought into the
          company.
Johnson : Well, if he’s making money, then it doesn’t matter what he’s doing.
Me      : OH. 
          You’re a psychiatrist or some shit...? 
          Sounds like you’re a fuckin’ moron. 
          He does IMMORAL SHIT. 
          So, if he’s literally assisting serial killers in killing innocent people...
          ...then as long as he’s not getting caught, AND he’s making money, 
          it doesn’t matter what he’s doing. 
Johnson : I didn’t say that.
Me      : Yeah, you definitely did.
          You said “As long as he’s making money, then it doesn’t matter.” 
          You’re just like a lot of other people in our society that say this fallacious bullshit. 
          “As long as such and such...” 
          It’s like:
          “As long as you don’t get CAUGHT murdering somebody to steal someone’s clients or money...? 
          Then that’s all that matters.” 
          That’s how stupid you sound.
Johnson : He’s OBVIOUSLY not killing people, otherwise he wouldn’t have a business...
Me      : *chuckles* Heh. 
          You didn’t even have the FIRST FUCKING CLUE how many times my son LIED TO YOU.
          What makes it so (OBVIOUS/READILY APPARENT) to you, that Dwayne’s not killin’ people, lady...? 
          Hm...?
          Did you work with the dude for 3+ years like I did, and outperform everyone at that company...?
Johnson : Nah.
Me      : Alright. 
          Look lady, I can literally provide VIDEO BASED EVIDENCE that shows people WHAT THE PROBLEM 
          REALLY IS.
          This dude LIED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT ME. 
          Guess what THAT wound up doing...?
Johnson : Probably caused people to not want to do work with you...
Me      : Ahhhh... 
          So, you’re not REALLY a moron after all, eh?
Johnson : Look dude... 
          Maybe you should change your morality a bit, that way you can take what you can get.
Me      : *chuckles* Oh, ok. 
          Here, instead of fixing this situation I’m in, where I COULD go RIGHT BACK to making `$800/hr...
          ...I’ll have to STOP doing what I’m doing, and then START doing what YOU do...
          ...such as, spreading your ass cheeks, getting pounded in the butt for minimum wage...
          ...and get nowhere fast.
          That’s such a brilliant plan, lady.
          How would I ever expect to drive a car, or pay a mortgage, or pay off my loans and stuff...?
Johnson : Well, maybe you need more training, or something.
Me      : Nah lady, I’m an expert. 
          I don’t think you get it...
          I have the talent to make guys like the former owners of Nfrastructure ask their clients/contacts...
          ...to commit incredibly sophisticated cyberattacks...
          ...like the one on January 15th, 2019...
          ...which involved this program called PEGASUS/PHANTOM...
          ...a CRITICAL VULNERABILITY AND EXPOSURE...
          ...a DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE...
          ...and a derivative of WANNACRY.
          It’s not like you know a single person that could do all of that.
          When I told you that the school records all of the phone conversations, THAT WAS IN FACT TRUE.
Johnson : No it wasn’t.
Me      : OH. 
          Ok. 
          Where did you get your Cisco Certified Network Academy certification, may I ask...?
          Cause anyone that’s at least STUDIED VOICE-OVER-IP knows that all conversations MAY BE SAVED.
Johnson : I asked someone that knows somebody over in IT.
Me      : Yeah, the person you asked in IT probably publishes the documents that get mailed out. 
          They don’t actually pull cables, nor cluster virtual machines nor use PowerShell to remotely 
          manage shit over the internet. 
          There’s nobody at Computer Answers that knows how to do any of that shit.
Johnson : OooOOOoOoooHHHhhhhHH...
Me      : *shakes head* Listen lady... I’m gonna be very up front with you, I don’t think you really 
          understand how much I miss my fuckin kids, and how much I resent you, specifically.
          I didn’t do anything to deserve this shit.
Johnson : Well, it seemed to me, the best decision was to slander you.
Me      : No, I understand that you’re not wary of the fact that my father was brutally murdered when 
          I was a child and then my mother failed to be around often enough to raise me...
Johnson : Doesn’t give you the right to be a fuckin’ deadbeat father.
Me      : Nah you’re right, about that... 
          I didn’t expect society to be full of so many judgmental morons that get paid no matter 
          how stupid they sound.
Johnson : Dude you’ve had all this time to figure something out, right...?
Me      : You put me in a position where the truth doesn’t even matter.
Johnson : Yeah, well, oh well dude. Grow the fuck up.
Me      : You know, its that mentality right there that causes me to think that humanity is basically fucked.
          Cause I dunno, I don’t wanna make assumptions here, but you sound like you’ve been handed 
          everything on a silver platter your whole life.
          Not even like you worked all that hard to get where you are...
Johnson : Bro. Are you fuckin’ serious right now...?
Me      : Yeah I am. Morons like you think you have something to hold over my head or whatever, 
          I’m telling you what’s tearing our society apart, and you’re tryin’ to tell me to suck it up and 
          move forward.
Johnson : What exactly did you think I would do if you told me that a couple guys tried to kill you...?
Me      : In all honesty, I thought maybe the town would say:
          “HOLY SHIT, A COUPLE DUDES TRIED TO KILL SOME GUY~!”
          And then the police could like, take my statement about the event...?
          Ya know...?
Johnson : Well, why DIDN’T they take a statement...?
Me      : Oh. Hold up a second, I’m trying to explain to you, THAT ISN’T MY FUCKIN JOB, LADY.
Johnson : It’s not my fuckin’ job either.
          Dude, everybody almost gets killed by 2 guys... Grow the fuck up.
Me      : Yeah I don’t think so. I think these guys were either FBI or probably foreign spies.
Johnson : *scoffs* You really do sound insane.
Me      : Hey, that’s because I’m not insane you’re just being a short sighted moron.
          Did you know that the computer shop I used to run, was like, attacked with serious cyberattacks...?
          Sorta like, just mentioned that.
Johnson : Look dude, I don’t care about any of that shit.
Me      : Yeah, that’s obvious.
          Basically, because I’m a lot smarter than most people, someone targeted me with a surgically 
          precise attack... which means that whatever I was doing...? It was pissing off somebody with a 
          lot of skill.
Johnson : Yeah well if you were any good at what you’re doin’ you’d be making some money, right...?
Me      : You really sound a lot like my mother, believe it or not. She has brain damage or some shit.
          She doesn’t make sense when she talks sometimes, cause the fuckin’ estrogen clouds her judgement.
          You and everybody else in society seem to think “OooOOOOohhhOohhhH make money. Support yourself.”
Johnson : Uh, yeah.
Me      : Well, unlike you, I don’t stoop so low as to suck some dude’s dick or kiss people’s asses 
          to get ahead in life. I just naturally piss off people that don’t have as much talent as I do.
Johnson : The world doesn’t run on talent dude. Nobody cares about talent.
Me      : Yeah, that’s why all these mass shootings happen, and then everybody blames the individual 
          instead of society.
Johnson : I’ll agree with you there, society IS broken.
          Oh well.
Me      : It needs fixing, and it’s not gonna fix itself if everybody’s busy chasing their fuckin’ tail.
          I’ll tell you what I can do, and why it matters.
          At some point, all of the oil will be gone.
          People like you who were judging me and having my kids taken away because I was almost killed...?
          It’s almost like you have no humanity.
          Makes no fucking sense.
          It’s almost like my father deserved to be killed, and that I need to just get over it...
          And you fuckin’ call yourself a psychiatrist...?
          Nah, I think the problem is the mentality of people in society.
          Like 90% of people in our society probably think just like you do.
Johnson : Tell me, what is it that makes you so special, or different...?
Me      : Well, if I tell people repeatedly, over and over, maybe eventually the reality will sink in.
          My life was FINE, until I began to cause someone who is nowhere near as talented as I am, 
          to feel jealous.
Johnson : Yeah, who’s that, Dwayne...?
Me      : He’s not the first person on the list.
          Nah, someone with a real deep wallet.
Johnson : Yeah...? Who, Pavel...?
Me      : Nah.
Johnson : Who, then...?
Me      : Mark Zuckerberg.
Johnson : That’s the dude who owns Facebook.
Me      : Right.
Johnson : He’s... a billionaire though.
Me      : Yeah. He is, what’s that supposed to mean...?
Johnson : That dude has a lot more talent than you’ll ever have.
Me      : Nah, not at all.
          Dude’s been censoring me for like 3.5 years.
          I’ve recorded videos of his “security team” using these advanced exploits against my systems.

Johnson : Yeah, well, maybe whatever you’re doing is pissing somebody off, and you should stop it.
Me      : That’s what someone with a vagina would think to do. Not a man with a nutsack.
          Basically what I’m saying, is that’s something a huge pussy would say/do.
          Basically exactly what MICHAEL ZURLO, DWAYNE COONRADT, or PAVEL ZAICHENKO would say/do.
          Zuckerberg is getting a lot of people hurt. 
          I think he’s a big reason why the country and society is turning to shit, and is basically...
          ...a communist state or monarchy now.
          Did you know that dude like, steals ideas from people...?
Johnson : So what, everybody has ideas dude.
Me      : Metaverse was an idea I had in 2013, I didn’t call it “Metaverse”.
          Basically with a pair of glasses, overlay a virtual world over the physical one.
Johnson : So, somehow that means you’re the idea king of all time and space or somethin’...?
Me      : Nah, I just know that I always have ideas, so when people TAKE my ideas, and don’t feel like giving 
          me credit...? It’s because they’re spineless cocksuckers that don’t know how to come up with their 
          own ideas, and that means they’re worthless, and morally bankrupt. 
          They’ll eventually regret making that decision. 
          Cause I’ll have a better idea.
Johnson : Whatever dude. You’re so full of yourself.
Me      : Let me ask you something, how much money do you make doing your job...?
          Because I guarantee, I have more experience with psychology than you do at it.
Johnson : *laughs profusely* HAHAHHAHAH YOU REALLY NEED TO SEE SOMEBODY, HOLY HELL...
Me      : Nah, lady. 
          I don’t need a piece of paper to outsmart you at the thing you have written on that “degree”.
          I really, don’t think anybody gets it...
          I don’t actually care that I’d be better at your job than you,
          without putting much thought to it either.
Johnson : So, you’re a defiant son of a bitch then.
Me      : Yeah, basically. Cause I see how everybody clamors for “OooOOOooHHHh A JOB...~!”
          I told myself a while ago that I have too much invested in this, if I wasn’t on some sort of LIST,
          I could… right now... get hired for a job making at least 250K a year.
Johnson : LOL, YEAH RIGHT BUDDY.
Me      : Hey, it’s fine I could make even more than that... I was making that much at Computer Answers. 
          The company was.
Johnson : Yeah, you gotta save up money and then you can do all that, bub.
Me      : Nah. I know a way more efficient way to do this.
Johnson : Oh yeah...? Then why don’t you DO it already...?
Me      : Because all good things take time.
          What I’m doing will make history.
          I’m certain of it.
          The whole time, everyone was telling me I needed to chase down pennies and nickels...
Johnson : Dude, you’ve got some issues, or delusions of grandeur.
Me      : I saw a shooting star one night when I went to visit my father at his grave.
          Right before I saw it, I was getting ready to leave, and I told my father that I was gonna leave 
          a mark on this world on his behalf.
          Ever since then... I see how petty the human race really is.
          A child is born and they’re taught that it’s ok to lie to one another, it’s ok to hurt one 
          another, it’s a dog-eat-dog world, and survival of the fittest... 
          But I think there’s a better example to set. 
Johnson : Nobody can fix society or the world.
Me      : If everybody thinks that, then that is what makes society as flawed as it is.
          Before long the world will devolve into chaos, and many people will die.
          Unless...

$Book.AddSection(8,"Center for Security",@"
I wanted to get the footage for the 911 call that I made in front of the camera here. I had already been to 
this place beforehand on 5/27/20, and the same blonde haired kid came up to me, and had this kinda dead-eyed 
look when I asked him about it. He immediately asked me if I had a badge, and I don’t. So, I said that and 
he’s like “Well, alright then.”

So I threw a real curveball and said “Ah, by the way, the FBI was just recording that conversation just now.”
Were they...? Probably not...? But, I don’t know. I had the device on me, and I know for a fact that SOMEONE 
at the FBI was interested in (watching/surveilling) me. It’s not exactly something I am trying to come across
as “braggadocios” about, it’s something that people should make an effort to desensitize themselves to,
because the concept isn’t all that rare.

They could be watching anybody that comes up with a rather PLAUSIBLE THEORY about the universe, that may have
gotten posted on Facebook/Reddit. I’m dead serious. I think they were actually surveilling me back in October 
2018 if not before that, because I posted my theory about the universe, and how the big bang is wrong.

The truth is, even if they were...? They’re not gonna be obvious about it at all.

$Book.AddSection(8,"AAA Clifton Park",@"
I went to this place as well, because on the night of the attack, I tried to leave some type of evidence that
I was here. As for THIS date, I was at this location for approximately 15 minutes or so.

I spoke to a woman and gave her estimates on time range and whatnot... I wasn’t necessarily asking to HAVE the 
footage, I just wanted to see if they could CORROBORATE my story, or time. Here’s the thing...

The dude over at Center for Security, he’s a little queer. 
He didn’t have to immediately be like “WHOA BUDDY...” because why would he jump to that without asking me 
what my intentions were, first...? And that’s just it. 

Innocent people will typically cooperate, they aren’t worried about getting in trouble for anything, cause
innocent people did nothing wrong. However, guilty people will typically act like the dude at Center for 
Security “You got a badge...?” That doesn’t necessarily mean that he’s guilty, it could be a standard
response. 

The bottom line is, typically people will ask you WHY you are requesting to see the footage, or WHAT FOR.

If they don’t even ask those questions...? Then it’s a pretty dead giveaway that they have SOMETHING to hide.
The people at this place were totally cooperative, and didn’t really provide any resistance at all.
I don’t think they had the footage I needed.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Computer Answers",@"
So, I was thinking about how I had this incident where 2 dudes committed a ransomware attack like a couple 
years before, and how this dude Dwayne, literally tells people that he can easily beat my numbers. 

He and I both know, he can’t. He knows he never will touch those numbers again. 
I’d imagine that ME having set such a high bar, is analogous to how Bill Gates and Paul Allen fucked 
everybody up, for a real long time. 

It’s not like I’m lying or hyperbolizing that. 
The dude cannot sell computers or anything at Computer Answers as well as I used to, without lying to people.
Cause, he’s not CREATIVE enough nor is he IMMERSED in what people really use their computers for.
If he was...? He would be a way better salesman. That’s all there is to it.

So, even though this is the case, the guy likes to feel like he’s got something to hold over me, right...?
That’s why I would occasionally go there, and ask him:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Me     : Hey, did you break `$30K at all recently...?
Dwayne : *wicked pissed* Dude, you act like you fuckin’ know everything. 
Me     : But, did you break `$30K at all in the last like, idk, several months...?
Dwayne : That’s not important...
Me     : Ahhh... not important... alright.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Dwayne uses a lot of REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY.
He will try his damndest to make it seem like it doesn’t bother him that he will talk so much shit about his 
numbers, but then I come along and I ask him about when the last time he cleared `$30K was. And he will have
this expression that has that Bob Lutz worried-about-shittin’-his-pants-in-front-of TUCKER CARLSON vibe.

Dwayne is not the type of dude who will take kindly to being told that he’s leavin’ skidmarks in his 
boxers or underwear. But hey, that’s alright. 
As long as he’ll work his ass off, and NEVER COME CLOSE TO MY SALES RECORDS...
That’s a victory for me, bro. Nah, I just... came, cleaned house, and took off. 
Like a miracle that just stopped by, and had to go. Oh well, bro.

Then, I went to Trickshot Billiards, with a few items that I found on the side of the road since I walk around 
town quite a lot. The cool thing is, even Judge James Hughes walks around town quite a bit. The literal town
justice. The end all, be all, of awesome local judges. 

Nah, I’m not even kidding around, James Hughes is actually pretty cool. I don’t know how he’ll feel about 
all my documents and rhetoric, but- I really would find it too difficult to believe that this man, would 
take some bribes or allow himself to be paid off... but I don’t know.

When you’re like ME, and you see a man his age, putting on his own god damn shoes, walking around his own 
god damn town, on his own friggen feet...? You start to develop a lot of respect for that person.

Robert Rybak probably isn’t an evil prick either, but I do have the feeling that he’s had some questionable
behaviors in the past. Regardless, I’m not gonna talk about any of that.

I saw Julie who’s Tim Berlin’s girlfriend, and she runs that place like a well-oiled machine.
Yeah, not once have I ever said anything bad about her, or really most of the girls that work there...
There are exceptions. Like Meg.

But it’s not something I spend my entire life dwelling on.

Me : Oh no, that girl that used to flirt with me a lot... she fuckin’ hates my guts now, doesn’t she...?
     *shakes head*
     Well... what am I gonna do?
     I’ve never experienced the feeling, of a female, despising me for any reason at all... ever. 
     Have I?
     Nope. 
     Not me. 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Of course I think it happens to everybody. I’m sure I’ve been considered to be a real obnoxious prick all
along the way... So, I deserve to be told “Hey douchebag~! *shakes head* You’re … somethin’ else man...”

Anyway, I’m ok with that. I tried to tell Julie in a manner that wasn’t outright blatant:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Me : Ah yeah, I think that phone belongs to the victim of a serial killer.
     And, here’s a couple other things.
     I think I’m being followed by a dirty cop, see ya later.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

So, I had a feeling that the DUDE DRIVING AN SUV that said 4130 on the plate, WAS ACTUALLY THE GUY WHO I
CALLED... “SHOULDER-PHONE COP”. I called him shoulder-phone cop (AKA “Scrotum Chin Pirrone”, or “Scrotes”) 
cause this dude was actually the most AMAZING cop I’ve ever seen in my entire life... 
...at standing in a single spot at the Halfmoon Sheriff Substation, for the entire fuckin’ time I was there...  
...on June 1st, 2020. 

I used to think ALL cops did actual, real, observable work...? 
But, this dude single handedly showed ME a thing or two, lemme tell ya...

 Easy to see that they DO shit most of the time they’re on duty.

Dude’s got it ALL figured out. He was, LITERALLY standing still, not moving, APPEARING as if he was doing 
something worthy of a paycheck... but I am just too fucking observant to not notice a dude standing in one 
spot. Not saying anything at all for the whole 45 minutes he had the phone to his ear...

Well, I’m wrong about that, cause he was definitely listening to something on the phone for an hour.
Maybe that’s a special position, you know...?
When kids were actually kids, someone would come around with a Super Soaker 6000, and then one kid would say:
“HEY, I’M NOT ALLOWED TO GET WET~!” 

Ohhhhhh, the kid who’s not allowed to get wet, fuckin’ up everybody’s day now, eh...?
Well, that is what Scrotes’ Pirrone, reminds me of… the kid that’s supposedly not allowed to get wet.
I think he was actually spying on somebody. 
Yeah, I think that dude is using PEGASUS/PHANTOM with an associate, and is literally stalking people...
...and that when I noticed him in front of Boomer-McCloud...
...I walked up to his vehicle and asked him a question...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Me      : Hey buddy, are you like, following me...?
Scrotes : Nah, not ME man.
          I was just over there, gettin’ myself a lil’ shake *grabs shake, shakes it...*
Me      : Ah, so you’re not like, waitin’ for me to walk in front of Eric Catricala’s funeral home by chance,
          are ya...?
Scrotes : No, no way bro, nuh-uh. Not me. *shakes his head*
          I’m ABOVE that, bro.
Me      : Alright buddy, keep in touch with yourself.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

It could not have been MORE BLATANT and OBVIOUS...
He had every intention of SWOOPING RIGHT IN, and MAKING AN UNLAWFUL ARREST...
...so that they could FRAME ME, for being on Catricala’s property.

So, I wound up walking back across the street, and I tell Dwayne the number of this dude’s vehicle, and he 
was probably so deep in thought, thinking about so many sales he needed to make... that he didn’t even notice.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Me     : Hey, 4130 is like fuckin’ followin’ me dude. 
         Later fuckface.
Dwayne : Alright dude, later~!

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Now you see, what that dude probably doesn’t understand or know, is that there’s like hundreds of 
microphones in that place. Yeah, so like, his own phone is definitely hacked by foreign intel, that’s why 
his calls dropped so often. Which, whatever. 

The point is, I could’ve allowed myself to be totally, randomly arrested, by being an oblivious dumbass that
this dude assumed I would be, and then...? Pirrone would’ve wasted NO time at all tryin’ to pump me in the 
butt, cause he has that kind of vibe. I’m all set on that, though.

Yeh, I don’t do the whole ‘allowing myself to be pumped in the butt, like Ted Cruz’ thing, so...
I saw Catricala standing there, basically lookin’ at me like he’s Johnny Sacks, and I’m Tony Soprano.
*chuckles* Heh. Bet you can’t get me now, buddy.
Catricala just stood there, lookin’ at me, shakin’ his head...
I could see this dude shaking his head, I’m not making that up, he just saw me, and started shaking his head.

I knew what he was thinking.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/    

Catricala : *shaking head* Unacceptable, Michael. 
            Totally unacceptable.
            I may live at 20 Anchor Drive...?
            Basically the same road as Stone Quarry Road...?
            Across from a street that starts with a letter B...?
            But- you’ll NEVER see that on ANY report that I submit with JAMES LEONARD.
            Ohhhhhh no, ya won’t.
            Will ya?

I wasn’t trying to have a conversation with him from the other side of route 9, it was more of a nonverbal
showdown between two guys on opposite sides of a main thoroughfare.
Could even be the name of a movie, show, or a book...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/    

“Showdown Between Two Guys on Opposite Sides of a Main Thoroughfare”
On the next exciting episode of “Showdown Between Two Guys on Opposite Sides of a Main Thoroughfare”...
There they were.
Just another day, as usual.
(2) guys...? 
Each, on their own respective side of the road.
The road, being a main thoroughfare.
A tale, as old as time itself.
One man...? 
A State Assemblyman, slash Funeral home owner...
The other...?
A highly advanced expert with technology...
...who just so happens to ALSO be wicked skilled at writing.
You really cannot come up with a FAR MORE INTERESTING STORY… than this, pal.
"@)

$Book.AddSection(8,"Walmart",@"
Shortly after the showdown between myself, and Mr. Catricala, (who happens to be alive, and well, believe it or   
not...) SCSO Clayton Brownell felt like coming right up on me near Walmart, and nearly scaring the shit outta
me. He got out of his SUV/vehicle, says “HEY MICHAEL~!”, and then immediately has his hand over his holstered 
weapon. Ah. I literally thought I was about to get shot. Why...? 

Oh, it’s cause of the thing I posted on Facebook.

I didn’t have a gun at all. But someone probably told him that I’m armed and dangerous. 
Armed, because I have (2) arms. And, dangerous... because, how could anyone not add that to every description 
about me...? What’s so dangerous about me...? Well, I’ll tell ya. I’m basically a one-man wrecking crew. 
But also, I’m dangerously obnoxious.    
 
Clayton gave me a large shot of adrenaline, when my fight-or-flight response kicked in.
Nah, now I’m ready to go on a mission when some dude looks like he’s about to whip out his pistol and he’s 
sayin’ my name. Just had the equivalent of 5 turbo shots in like 10 seconds...
...heart is pounding really fast. Time to lose this dude somehow... 

So I weave into the Walmart parking lot...
...and then I manage to evade this guy, cause I have no earthly idea if I’m about to get shot...
I was there, man.
I seen it, almost (go down/got shot).
It became a reality to me, it was ALMOST game over, AGAIN.
Almost.

Anyway, I lost Clayton, and made it to GT Toys...
And that is when I saw a brigade of police cruisers, barreling down Route 9.
Obviously, they needed about 6 of these guys to intercept a (1) man wrecking crew like myself...
"@)

$Book.AddSection(8,"Flashback [~] GT Toys/Trooper Borden/Clayton Brownell",@"
I attempted to get all the way through the parking lot, but I failed, because then all of a sudden, there’s
the man, the myth, the legend... It’s Trooper Borden. Here’s the thing about Trooper Borden...

He starts out the entire conversation with “Oh man I guess I gotta lie right now...”
So, naturally, I expect that every word out of his mouth will SOUND believable, but BE wrong.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/    

Borden   : Hey, Michael~!
Me       : YEAH…~?
Borden   : Hold up, buddy.                                                          (← COMMAND, NOT A SUGGESTION)
Me       : Can you give me a ride to the FBI or the military base...?
Borden   : Sure. 
           You gonna be cool now...?
Me       : Yeh.
Borden   : *puts his shades on* Alright. *steps out of his vehicle*
Me       : I thought you were gonna give me-
Borden   : Nah, can’t do that, I was just sayin’ that to get you to stop running...                  (← FALSETTO)
Me       : Oh I see, you just flat out lied to me, huh...?
           REAL cool...
Borden   : Hey man, it’s part of my job description...
           Sometimes I gotta lie to people, for their safety.          (← HAS  BEEN FILLED IN ON MY SOCIAL MEDIA)
Me       : (not enthusiastic) Cool.
Borden   : So, you’re the man with a plan now, eh...?
Me       : Nah, you basically shot my plan to shit...
Borden   : I know that.
           I’m just sayin’, beforehand, like, last month to now.
           You’re just like, *hand wavin’ around* walkin’ all over the place...
           Taking on Verizon and stuff, eh?
Me       : Sorta.
           I mean, it’s a lot BIGGER than that, but yeh.
Borden   : Buddy. It’s gonna be tough to take em all on your own.
Me       : No shit.
Borden   : *suspenseful stare* Alright.
           Look, I gotta search ya, to make sure you’re whatever, and stuff. (← SHOULD’VE STATED REASON FOR STOP)
Me       : What the hell is whatever and stuff...?
Borden   : I mean I gotta put some cuffs on ya. 
           Don’t worry I’ll take em off in a few...
Me       : OH YEAH...?
           Says the guy that just flat out lied to me... 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

What I should have stated BEFORE Trooper Borden decided to “detain me”, is “what are you detaining me for?”
Because, EVERY CITIZEN SHOULD DO THIS. 
How do I know that Trooper Borden wasn’t dispatched to destroy my evidence...? 

I was actually GRAVELY CONCERNED THAT ENTIRE DAY, that WOULD or even COULD LIKELY HAPPEN.

My smartphone had its battery unplugged, so I know I wasn’t being TRACKED at all. 
Still, I don’t expect EVERYBODY is gonna know how to buy a pentalobe screwdriver, and then a #000 tripoint 
screwdriver, so that they can PHYSICALLY unplug the battery. Just so I make myself VERY CLEAR, Samsung Galaxy 
devices actually REQUIRE a tool to heat the glass on the back of the device to PHYSICALLY UNPLUG THE BATTERY. 
And that glass breaks VERY EASILY. That’s intentional, actually.

These devices are being MADE with these DESIGN ELEMENTS to FOOL MOST PEOPLE. 
So people like KRISTIN JOHNSON, or LAURA HUGHES, or DWAYNE COONRADT. 
They know they’re not capable of (saying/thinking) anything that someone important will care about.

Regardless, these design implementations aren’t happening by accident. 
They’re INTENTIONAL, they FORCE YOUR DEVICE to be PRIVY to being COMMANDEERED by FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE. 
So, the ACTUAL POLICE, they don’t realize that they’re being SPIED ON.
Whether it’s THROUGH THEIR DEVICE, or it’s a RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICER that they (WORK WITH/TRUST).

Target devices are ANYTHING WITH A CAMERA OR MICROPHONE, that would include:  
GOOGLE CHROMEBOOKs, IPADs, SMART TVs, XBOX/PLAYSTATION CONSOLES, SECURITY SYSTEMS/CAMERAS, etc.

So, if somebody says “There’s NO WAY that my device is spying on me.”,                          (← FALLACY ALERT)
Tell that person, they’re an idiot to ASSUME as such, and to spend some time reading this document. 

There DEFINITELY IS A WAY THAT ANYBODY’S DEVICE SPIES ON THEM, ACTUALLY. 
But- most people aren’t THAT interesting.

Whether or not a particular person is INTERESTING enough for anybody to CARE about... is the REAL question.
People assume “There’s NO WAY that I’m interesting enough for people to be spying on ME.”       (← FALLACY ALERT)

Well, I can tell ya, that I come up with a lot of ideas that people like MR. PICKETT, PAVEL ZAICHENKO, 
or even MARK ZUCKERBERG, would want to (LISTEN TO/STEAL/COPY), at any given moment.

People really should consider that if you have a COOL idea, someone will DEFINITELY try to (STEAL/COPY) it...
...cause it’s probably worth MONEY. 
Moron: “OH. IS THAT WHY...? I thought maybe there was some ALTERNATE reason that didn’t really matter...”
Nah, I mean there are probably MANY other reasons, but INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT IS SERIOUS.

The police don’t really treat it as if it is, which means that this is really the same thing as a: 
(communist country/monarchy). That’s because SOME people see EVERYONE ELSE, as THEIR PROPERTY THAT THEY OWN.

That’s how the FCC came into existence.
They stole Nikola Tesla’s wireless technology.
So, if you’re not (saying/doing) anything INTERESTING to someone IMPORTANT...
...then the natural assumption most people make, is correct.

In my case, I’m actually a CONSIDERABLE THREAT to national security, but not in a bad way. 
They know that I wrote a poem about this demon that steals people’s dreams, ideas, and legacies.
It’s called “The Uncanny Valley”

Almost as if they’re growing clones, and whenever they think of something COOL, they kill that clone.
That’s how they harvest CROPS to like, EAT.
The problem with that MENTALITY, is that it can actually cause the people who think we’re all PROPERTY...
...to be KILLED WITH EXTREME PREDJUDICE, LEGALLY, by a CONSTITUTIONAL MILITIA. Weird. Could literally do
that RIGHT THIS SECOND... But- there’s a reason why that hasn’t happened YET.

They don’t really like it when someone that knows their rights declares something to these people who think
everybody is PROPERTY or a PRODUCT, such as: “I intend to kill you.”
Cause to them...? They just heard a PRODUCT, tell them that they’re gonna die.

So, they should really consider NOT treating people like PROPERTY.
Some of them respect that approach whole-heartedly.
But there are SOME of them that act exactly like MacBeth, who will probably keep asking the witch about 
MacDuff for weeks and weeks. Eventually, day after day, week after week, MacDuff just keeps destroying 
everyone in his way. Nobody can stop this fuckin’ dude. Eventually, MacDuff makes it to MacBeth, and MacBeth 
gets very violently killed.

(^ Someone has this fate, because they think we’re all PROPERTY/PRODUCTS)

That probably sounds retarded... but it’s true. I couldn't tell ya how many times they've crashed my word
editor on Windows, Linux, Smartphone... doesn't matter.

I’m seeking to dismantle many of the corrupt laws that they’ve passed.

The reason for my “detainment” is because Eric Catricala attempted to have me arrested for being on his 
property that day. But after I spoke with Julie at Trickshot Billiards, I saw Scrotum Chin Pirrone across
the street, sitting there waiting for me. As soon as I walked outside, this cocksucker starts driving. He
was waiting to capitalize on an opportunity to ILLEGALLY ARREST ME. I crossed the street to talk to him.
Quite literally, I said to this fuckin’ idiot, “Are you following me...?” And then he said “Nah man, I was 
just getting a shake.” 

Amazingly, Scrotes was lying to me right there and then. He DEFINITELY WAS following me. Why...? I’m sure 
it has to do with the letter I dropped off with Dr. Robinson, AND, being at Center for Security. 
The problem with the police, is that none of them EVER KNOW if their (PEER/SUPERIOR) lies to them. Ever. 
Not (1) single cop I have ever met. Why...? PRINCIPLE OVER PERSONALITY. I’m being obtuse here, they fuckin’ 
know sometimes, but they have to keep that information to themselves and make additional observations to 
conclude a PLAUSIBLE THEORY. For instance, someone who wears glasses at the State Trooper’s office in the 
Clifton Park Public Safety building, he was involved in the murder attempt.

Anyway, instead of Trooper Borden asking me whether I was at Catricala’s funeral home or not...? I have a 
feeling that they were going to use my pictures that I took way back on May 25th, 2020 that were taken at 
NIGHT, to have EVIDENCE to arrest me for. These FRAMERS aren’t the dumbest people in the world, they’ve 
gotten a lot of people. That’s how ORGANIZED CRIME SYNDICATES work. 

If they want to FRAME ME, they will FAIL. Why...? Because I record the mistakes they make.
Judge Paul Pelagalli is involved in this ORGANIZED CRIME SYNDICATE, so is ERIC CATRICALA, JOHN HOFFMAN, 
BRUCE TANSKI, and MICHAEL ZURLO.
I’m a lot smarter than they are. It’s hard to arrest somebody for something they didn’t do, when you
have to MANUFACTURE EVIDENCE like JAMES LEONARD DID, to get me arrested for a KAYAK STRAP at a DIFFERENT
TIME THAN IT ACTUALLY OCCURRED. The key reason being the CONTEXT OF WHAT I DID, is that I was being ATTACKED.
Was Zackary Karel in possession of a stolen kayak...? I have no idea and frankly I don’t care. But- what I 
do know, is that these fucks didn’t ask me about the PICTURES. 

Oh, let’s put the cuffs on and search Mr. Cook. ILLEGAL SEARCH AND SEIZURE. Violation of the 4th amendment. 
Why...? Oh, it’s because CATRICALA is a STATE ASSEMBLYMAN that lives on ANCHOR DRIVE. And, he decided to 
tell the police that I was on his property, AND, was attempting to “drag me around the minimap”, to where 
legally speaking, my PHYSICAL EXISTENCE on the OPPOSITE SIDE of route 9, didn’t actually matter. Nah. 
Same exact scenario as the ticket in SCSO-2020-003173, where nobody asked about the phone line I cut. Nah. 
That’s actually a lot more important because IF I WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO CALL 911, AND SOME ASSHOLE USED 
SOFTWARE TO PREVENT THAT, then it means that SCSO (can/will/has) LITERALLY ignore that. That’s not an IF.

           Sometimes I *taps chest with chin since I have cuffs on my wrists* myself, am DANGEROUS...
           And, some of the EVIDENCE I have in that backpack, that you haven’t looked at, is also DANGEROUS.
Borden   : C’mon Mike, lets be specific here...

           I can trust what Trooper Borden’s sayin’ right now, he’s not lying to me this time.
Brownell : *surprised look on his face* Well, sounds like he kinda knows the ropes, man...
Borden   : Alright, so, what’s goin’ on with your kids there, dude...?
Me       : What do you mean...?
Borden   : Well, they’re beautiful kids dude, you could go back there right now, and this’ll all be over.
Me       : Nah. 
           I really don’t think that’s an option anymore.
           Not gonna just forget about almost being killed by (2) dudes.
Borden   : C’mon Mike, how’d you know they were tryin’ to kill ya...?
Me       : Uh, cause they fuckin’... 
           ...dude, it’s not something I can explain in like a single sentence.
           They were tracking me on my phone.
Borden   : Mike, are you serious, these dudes were tracking you on your phone...? 
           How...?
           That should be totally illegal~!
Me       : I dunno man. 
           There’s gotta be some program that does it.
           Like, 911 emergency location services, or cellular rebids...
           Almost as if the cell phone companies have stuff that does this, and nobody knows that...
           Pretty sure even Microsoft could do that.
Borden   : Yeah, well, that’s Microsoft. They can.
           But if it’s anybody else...? 
           I can call my buddies at the Federal Counter-Terrorism Intelligence Agency...
           ...and ask them if they know anything about this program...
           ...or like, (Anonymous/Cicada).
Me       : Yeah, well they used this program to block my 911 calls.
Borden   : What do you mean...?
Me       : I dialed 911 twice... 
           ...May 26th, 2020 at 0004 near Clifton Park Eye Care...
           ...May 26th, 2020 at 0009 in front of the camera at Center for Security...
           ...the reason you’re even HERE, is because someone is committing OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
           Both times, it failed to make it to dispatch.
           I walked to Stratton Air National Guard last month...
           ...cause I found somethin’ else that was... alarming.
Borden   : That is highly disturbing... alright. 
           I’ll call my buddies...
           *dials phone number*
           Hey.
<unknown> : …
Borden   : ...do the police or military have a program that can track people’s phones?
<unknown> : No way, buddy. That’s impossible.
Borden   : You’re sure now, right?
           There’s no way that this could ever blow up in our face...
           ...or somehow be the same thing as (PEGASUS/PHANTOM)...?
<unknown> : Nah, we would know if the police or the military had something like that.
Borden   : Cause, this guy seems to be CERTAIN that we have a program like that...
<unknown> : Buddy, I just said, with sheer certainty, nah we don’t. 
           Nothin’ like that exists.
Borden   : You’re sure now...?
<unknown> : I mean theoretically, we might...?
           But, it wouldn’t be called PEGASUS.
           It’d be called PHANTOM.
           It’s been around since like, 2014.
           So that’s like... *checks watch*
           ...almost 6 years.
Borden   : So, we DO have something like that...?
<unknown> : ...it’s a classified (program/tool) that provides remote access to ANY smartphone on earth... 
           ...nobody’s allowed to confirm its existence.
Borden   : So, if this kid knows it exists...
<unknown> : Can’t confirm its existence.
Borden   : He was almost killed by it on May 25th 2020 – May 26th 2020...
<unknown> : Dude, oh well. 
           He probably did something to deserve it.
           ...even HE can’t know. 
           Even if he DOES know...? 
           LEGALLY, he can’t.
Borden   : So, what you’re saying is that it’s ILLEGAL for him to KNOW it exists...?
<unknown> : Didn’t say that either, dude.
           You’re just not gettin’ it, are ya...?
Borden   : Nah, what are you trying to say...?
<unknown> : Buddy, have you lost your fuckin’ mind?
           I’m tryin’ to tell YOU that, yeah.
           Something like that DOES exist.
           But, you can’t tell a CITIZEN...
           ...because it’s a classified (program/weapon).
Borden   : So, it DOES exist...?
<unknown> : Yes, but do not tell him at all.
Borden   : So you’re telling ME that it exists, but I should tell HIM-
<unknown> : ...that it doesn’t, bro.
           What the actual fuck, you’re a State Trooper...?
Borden   : Yeh man... 
           Sorry for botherin’ you, just wanna make sure I don’t lie to this kids face.
<unknown> : Well, you definitely have to.
           Take care buddy.
Borden   : Alright, thanks buddy.
<unknown> : No problem.
Borden   : *hangs up*
           Well, Mike... 
           I’ve got bad news.
Me       : Sounded like you were like confirming that it exists, and that it doesn’t exist...
           ...then it does again...
Borden   : Nah, straight from the horses mouth, doesn’t exist.
Me       : I’m pretty sure it does. 
           I have like (3) videos of it.
Borden   : What about the pictures you’ve got...?
           You got some pictures of stuff from Catricala’s or somethin, right...?
Me       : Yeah.
           I took those pictures IMMEDIATELY BEFORE the murder attempt at (05/25/20 2343 → 05/26/20 0155)
           What about em...?
Borden   : The pictures you took... 
           Do you remember the (make/model) of the boat...?
Me       : Eh, no but I remember getting a shot of the boat, for sure.
           I also see a BONE sitting on the window sill.
           Might have belonged to a PERSON.
           To be fair, I have OTHER leads for these serial killers.
Brownell : Well, lay it on us, dude... 
           Maybe we’ll help you figure it out...
Me       : Well, the Matchless Stove and Chimney at 1774 Route 9, is missing it’s mailbox.
           I also took a couple pictures of a NYSEG power meter.
Brownell : That doesn’t necessarily mean anything, though....
Me       : By itself...? 
           Nah. 
           The power to the building is still on. 
           I tried to talk to Trooper Leavey about some of this. 
           I think there are serial killers here in town.
Borden   : C’mon Mike... 
           You know, if there were serial killers in town, we would’ve found em by now, right?  (← FALLACY ALERT)
Me       : Sure (nah).

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

I kept my whole (← FALLACY ALERT) comment to myself.
Because if you’re detained and they’re talkin’ like THAT...? 
They’re not gonna care how moronic they sound. 
Nor will they care if you found a billion gold coins. 
They believe they’re making a SAFE ASSUMPTION or EDUCATED GUESS, when in fact, that’s not what that’s called.

That’s basically being totally fucking clueless, and APPEARING to have already checked or known.
In other words, it’s literally an assumption that YOU WILL KNOW, is wrong.

Not unlike how the guy from PARAGON SECURITY called some dude up in the FBI building behind him, talked to 
some guy, and I told him “yeah, I’m worried that there’s somebody in there who’s gonna tell you to fuck off”, 
and then like fuckin’ magic, this guy said 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Paragon : Well, they told me to tell YOU, to fuck off already. 
          They have everything they need, they’ll be in touch.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Cool. How are they supposed to do that without the EVIDENCE I had on my POSSESSION, AND, without my PHONE NUMBER?
That’s how stupid some of the police, or security agencies really are.
Yeah, I’m literally calling out Investigator Christopher Murphy, because, respect is a TWO WAY STREET.
This dude has never once made an effort to call my ass back, and THAT is what causes me to think he’s tried to 
get me killed.

They will (know/assume) that they would’ve found a serial killer by now. 
Cause, they’re the “experts”. 
They already know ahead of time who the serial killers in *points downward* this town, happen to be. 

Even if you have EVIDENCE...? 
They don’t bother looking at ALL of it... 
Unless YOU are like ME (very intelligent) and then THEY look at that EVIDENCE while YOU are ALSO looking at it...
...on YOUR device. Not theirs. 

Nah. They know the EVIDENCE exists. They don’t need to ever collect ANY.
They’re working OVERTIME, to keep it from being SEEN BY THE PUBLIC. (← CENSORSHIP, THATS ILLEGAL) 
(^ A [RACKETEER INFLUENCED CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION] does this.)

Brownell : Michael, were you at the Catricala Funeral Home today...?
Borden   : Ah, yeah, that’s right.
           That’s the reason I had to detain you, by the way.
           I should’ve told ya that, but...
           I don’t play by the rules, sometimes.
           Well, most of the time.
Me       : *to Borden* Whatever dude.
           *to Brownell* No, but I saw a dude from your unit at the plaza right next to it.
Brownell : What type of vehicle...?
Me       : Nearly unmarked SUV...? 
           4130.
Brownell : *puts hand on back of neck, thinking momentarily* Ah, that’s the traffic safety cop. 
Me       : Yeah, well *cocks head slightly* seems more like a scrotum safety cop to me...
Brownell : Hey. 
           You know you shouldn’t disrespect another officer like that...
Me       : Nah man, sometimes it’s warranted, that dude was following me for a while down Route 9.
Brownell : *about to scoff but catches himself cause it sounds plausible* 
           Now, why would he be doin’ that...?
Borden   : Yeah, Mike.
           Answer THAT one...
Me       : Well, it could be because Deputy Pirrone has been ordered to commit OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, 
           and he destroyed the footage of my 911 call at Center for Security back on May 26th, 2020.
           Ya know...?
           I went backward in time, and left a letter that DESCRIBES DEPUTY PIRRONE in the letter I left
           at 5 CHELSEA PLACE today, with DR. ROBINSON.
           Weird.
           Almost as if I found a clever way to outsmart a group of morons.
           I also went to the Feiden Appliance Center, because I was looking for anything to prove that 
           evidence of the record SCSO-2020-028501 (SCOTT SCHELLING, JEFFREY KAPLAN, JOSHUA WELCH, ZAPPONE)
           EXISTS, but MICHAEL WHITACRE hasn’t yet gone to talk with SUPERINTENDANT DR. ROBINSON about the 
           content of those letters, nor who SCROTUM CHIN is, the “traffic safety cop” that was CONVENIENTLY 
           in the plaza next to the CATRICALA FUNERAL HOME.
           It’s not like I’m makin’ this shit up, either.
Borden   : You know Mike, you can get in a LOT OF TROUBLE, for comin’ up with these tall tales of yours...
Me       : Listen cocksucker, I’m gonna keep writing this story over and over again until somebody does 
           something about it. Hoping that you people are gonna do the job...? It’s fuckin’ moronic.
           Cause I have every reason to believe that your command post is compromised.
           But, everybody that wants to help is gonna have to fuckin’ tip-toe around the situation, right?
           Obviously YOU cannot be TRUSTED.
           However, I trust this Brownell dude over you any day of the week.
           Reason being, the dude has not lied to my face, not once, not ever.
           ...even though he DID scare the shit out of me with that incident in front of Walmart.
Brownell : Well, somebody told me that you had a gun on ya...
Me       : Nah, I wrote a post about WANTING TO PURCHASE A FIREARM FOR SELF DEFENSE, because a couple
           cocksuckers tried to murder me. THEN, Facebook banned me for 30 days so I can’t actually 
           communicate with people and tell them that I’m afraid I’m gonna get killed.
Borden   : Alright, well... 
           ...it’s whatever man.
           You can get in a lot of trouble for using your FREEDOM OF SPEECH/EXPRESSION...
           Guess I better take the cuffs off...
           *starts unlocking the handcuffs*
Me       : The first amendment was written along with several others, just so you know...
           You oughtta read the constitution sometime.

After Trooper Borden and crew decided to kick me loose, I walked all the way to my friend Samantha Caine’s 
house. She apparently, wasn’t home. While I was walking there, I plugged the BATTERY back into the LOGIC 
BOARD, and then all of a sudden... Whoa. A kid that I saw at my friend’s house the night prior...?

Sorta like, showed up coincidentally... in the passenger seat of somebody’s car. Coincidental? Maybe.
I kept walking down Crescent Road, and noticed that some dude with sunglasses was following me on foot. Cool.
Coincidence...? Maybe.

Weird. Lots of fuckin’ coincidences... Way too many.
I left a quarter behind her mailbox, to leave some type of clue that I was, in fact, actually there.
Walked all the way back home...

$Book.AddSection(8,"June 19th, 2020",@"
At some point in the day, a woman named LAURA HUGHES showed up, knocking on the door.
She seemed to have such GENUINE CONCERN about me almost being murdered... that she made no mention of it.
She asked to speak with me, so I went and spoke to her outside at the table.
While we were speaking, I was explaining to this lady how I had spent the last few weeks, having people at
SCSO FACILITATE AN ATTEMPTED MURDER, and then COMMITTING OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

It was an incredibly SERIAL CASE of these CRIMES happening, that they weren’t arresting themselves for...
...that explaining them to someone like LAURA HUGHES probably felt like I was insane or something.
But- no. Sometimes I happen to be A LOT MORE INTELLIGENT than people who have MISJUDGED me.

Some details would be made incredibly clear to me over the last couple of years, that I didn’t know for sure
that day. Now, I asked this lady to do what I call “taking notes”, AND to make an audio recording.
Haven’t gotten that audio recording... Hm.

Whenever I said something that I thought would be worthy enough to “write down as a note”...? 
I would “take a mental note”, whether she was actually using her “hands” to “type something important”.

What I remember specifically, is this lady barely touched the keyboard. 
Which is sorta irrelevant, because NOW I know that the system is corrupt and trying to protect certain people
in it, which is actually against the law on all accounts.

While she was speaking to me, both DEPUTY MICHAEL WHITACRE, and DEPUTY MARK SHEEHAN showed up.
MARK SHEEHAN appeared to have read some of the documents I wrote and distributed on the FLASH DRIVE that I 
gave to DR. OLIVER ROBINSON at 5 CHELSEA PLACE.

MARK SHEEHAN had a look on his face that day, which told me more than words, basically he said “there IS no
vehicle 4184” Ah. No shit, it’s probably why it’s a fake cop car that’s being used to commit fraud.

MICHAEL WHITACRE seemed to have some genuine concern, until this dude DEPUTY CAPTAIN COOPER, showed right up.
As soon as CAPTAIN COOPER showed up...? He immediately said the words “NFRASTRUCTURE is not involved in this.”

Well, dipshit. Here’s a good way to prove how far up your own ass, your head was that day...

Sorta looks exactly like maybe JESSE PICKETT might have some fuckin’ involvement after all, numbnuts.
What, you’re like a CAPTAIN at SCSO...? And I just miraculously outperformed your ass, as well as all of your
subordinates...? OR were you committing OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE in tandem? (← GOOD QUESTION, the answer is BOTH)

(06/19/20 SCSO-2020-003688) MICHAEL B. WHITACRE: (← I TRUST THIS GUY ACTUALLY) On this date, I was dispatched 
to the listed location for a report of a male by the name of Michael Cook that keeps going to the Shenendehowa 
School District office. Upon Arrival I spoke with the school superintendent, Dr. Robinson. He explained that 
Michael has expressed concerns that the school issued laptop computer given to his daughter is “bugged”

| Nor did I ever (think/indicate) that anyone who works for Shenendehowa has such (talent/experience) because  | 
| I knew for a FACT, it was being exploited by the FBI/CIA/NSA probably via a [VAULT 7 tool]                   |

The most recent instance was on 06/18/20 at about 1330. Michael went to the front door, and was let into the 
office. He put a laptop that belonged to the school on the counter and began yelling at the receptionist saying 
that the computer was bugged. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
| Note: I didn’t start out by yelling at the lady who SUBMITTED A TICKET FOR THE HOTSPOT DAYS BEFORE           |
| Some of my frustration was resultant to my children needing the INTERNET to do their SCHOOLWORK              |
| Ya know...? Sorta said that WAY FURTHER UP. 5 CHELSEA PLACE is the SAME PLACE I submitted the ticket.        |
| I later met with DR. OLIVER ROBINSON in OCTOBER 2020 and gave HIM and his ASSISTANT the TICKET NUMBER.       |
| As soon as I gave them the TICKET NUMBER, his ASSISTANT IMMEDIATELY RAN OUT OF THE ROOM.                     |
| As far as I can tell, that woman MAY have IMMEDIATELY went to DELETE that ticket.                            |
| I have no reason to think otherwise, believe it or not. If I’m wrong about that...? I’ll own up to it.       |
| As for 6/18/20, the device was MOST DEFINITELY BEING USED TO EAVESDROP ON MY RESIDENCE.                      |
| [That means it was DEFINITELY bugged]                                                                        |

Michael has left two separate multi-page letters at the office as well as a thumb drive. The first letter was 
him expressing his displeasure with the internet speed in the area, and how Spectrum is running a monopoly. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

MYSELF, DEPUTY SHEEHAN, and DEPUTY COOPER went to MICHAEL’S residence to speak to him as well as advise him on 
DR. ROBINSON’s behalf, that he is (not?) allowed on school property w/out first calling and making arrangements 
to do so. When contact was made w/ Michael, a CPS worker was there speaking to him about an unrelated matter. 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

| - the incident on (06/13/20) was resultant to my children complaining about the lack of INTERNET             |
| - I already submitted a thing called a TICKET to GET access to the INTERNET, by requesting a HOTSPOT         |
| - The lady at IMS wasn’t really HELPFUL, and my son was LYING ABOUT HIS PASSWORD                             |
| - I had to contact ELIZABETH RILEY to get the PASSWORD                                                       |
| - I decided to just SUBMIT THE TICKET AT THE DISTRICT OFFICE days BEFORE (6/18/20), AT THIS OFFICE.          |
| - I had just DISCONNECTED THE INTERNET SERVICE because the PROVIDER was ATTACKING ME                         |
| - I had even CALLED THE FBI at one point, but they basically ATTACKED ME EVEN MORE                           |

Michael was advised about staying off school property to which he agreed to comply and his letters along with 
the thumb drive given to his mother. Michael did not show any indication that he wanted to hurt himself or 
anyone else. Nothing further at this time. (End of report written by DEPUTY MICHAEL WHITEACRE)

So, I had every belief that speaking to these people was going to be HELPFUL, not DETRIMENTAL.
It was DETRIMENTAL in the sense that I had to write this material/book, to showcase a real life example, of
how many people worked together and didn’t have their fuckin’ facts straight... and they ALL wound up looking 
like a long list of morons.

Father’s Day | Asked my mother for a ride to my aunt Nancy’s house. She said “Nah”, so I wound up walking the 
entire way from Clifton Park → Menands → New Salem | Why...? Uh, because I still have the same suspicion NOW, 
that I did THEN, which is that someone in my family was responsible for my fathers’ death as well as the 
attempted murder on May 26th, 2020, AND, was able to get someone to lock me out of my device...
...EVEN THOUGH I SHOWED THE VIDEO TO SHAEMUS LEAVEY on (05/27/20 0900), near 203D Halfmoon Circle.

I think that someone who works with Capital Digitronics, also works with the military, and the State Police, 
AND the people who live at 203D Halfmoon Circle...? They work for...? CAPITAL DIGITRONICS.

I later spoke with Tom McCabe (03/21/22) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYKHBlJFC4-w8K1q0ROM4CvLF0dfwdbo
I do not believe Tom McCabe is involved in this at all. HOWEVER, SOMEONE HE WORKS WITH DEFINITELY IS.    
I believe that PARTICULAR SOMEONE has had my HOUSE BUGGED, for some time, and has coordinated some of these 
ATTACKS with my cousin RYAN WARD, and perhaps (John/Dan/Jesse) Pickett.

I luckily ran into MATT ROERIG in Menands, we spoke for like a half hour. 
He told me the digital birds are a real thing. (Evidence: 2021 0207 Bird-Zodiac - https://youtu.be/zXkmxtYQ6wQ)

I told him where I was going, he offered to pay for an Uber, I declined. MATT ROERIG gave me some water and 
sunscreen. We talked about Nfrastructure, (since he lived next door) and the Picketts, and Zaichenko. 
Then I left. I got to Albany, saw Nicole Bonesteele (possibly) at a bar near Quail St./New Scotland Ave.

Didn’t think it would be relevant at all, but I kept it pinned in memory. 
Then I walked all the way down New Scotland until I was near the Holy Names. 
Directly across the street, is the CORRECTIONS TRAINING ACADEMY, 1134 NEW SCOTLAND ROAD. 
I immediately saw several black DODGE CHARGERS, so I walked closer to the building. 
Then, I saw a black DODGE DART parked in the CAPTAIN’s spot, cause I can read signs and stuff...

| Earlier on 06/01/20, DJ Thompson processed my ‘unlawful arrest’ and processed me at the Halfmoon Sheriff   |

| Thompson : You know, I don’t really give a shit if you have an alibi for this, right...?                   |

I remember it had a sticker in the windshield, red Clinton County Community College sticker.

So, here’s how I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN BY ONE OF THE (2) DUDES THAT I RECORDED IN THE VIDEO I   
SHOWED TO SHAEMUS LEAVEY... 
 
I kept walking down NEW SCOTLAND ROAD, I saw a familiar lookin’ dude with a RED MINIVAN getting gas at STEWARTS.
About a HALF HOUR or more afterward, someone in a WHITE SUV (probably a Mercedes-Benz SUV) passed me...
__________________________________________________________
| <insert hyperlink | 2529 Route 85-A, Voorheesville, NY |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
So, I am walking in THIS direction, right...? 
When all of a sudden, I see that the WHITE SUV that JUST PASSED ME...? 
IMMEDIATELY hit its BRAKE LIGHTS... AFTER the person DRIVING IT, SAW ME walking on the OTHER side of 
the road. I immediately had a ringing in my ear right before I saw the brake lights. 
Almost like I have like a “sixth sense”, or SOMETHIN’... ya know...? 

Lets’ put it like this... imagine if someone REALLY WANTED to KILL YOU. 
Don’t think about ANY EXISTENCE OF DOUBT. 
IMAGINE that it is ACTUALLY HAPPENING. Now, INITIATE THAT SIMULATION. 
Someone ACTUALLY trying to MURDER YOU...
Ask yourself, how FAST would that vehicle STOP, and then TURN AROUND, and then CATCH BACK UP with ya...? 
Well... That is EXACTLY the scenario that occurred.

So, when my mother tells me “Honey if they wanted to kill you, you would’ve been dead by now...”
...she doesn’t realize how many times they’ve tried. This motherfucker ALMOST got me. ALMOST.
He had some way of knowing that I was HEADED THERE, or ALMOST THERE, because... 
...there’s no fucking way that SUV I saw in CLIFTON PARK, would BE THERE and ARRIVE in the SAME FUCKING 
COINCIDENTAL MANNER, unless of course, my HOUSE WAS BUGGED... right?

OR, get this. Maybe MATT ROERIG told this cocksucker. 
Maybe MATT, offered to pay for an UBER for me, to fake me out, completely. 
But then, MATT wouldn’t make sense to be the one that was CONVENIENTLY IN CLIFTON PARK. 
So, nah. Pretty sure Matt can hack stuff, but not the shit I dealt with at the Computer Answers shop
that’s DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET from the CATRICALA FUNERAL HOME. 
    
Somehow this (person/ERIC CATRICALA) IN THE SUV knew that I ONCE I MADE IT TO NANCYS HOUSE...? 
KILLING ME would become A PRETTY FUCKIN’ STUPID IDEA.

So, he was AGGRESSIVELY HUNTING ME, driving into the driveway up on the RIGHT.
Which, you gotta figure that HIM trying to do this, especially when I know exactly where he lives...?
Hm. A NY State Assemblyman, trying to murder me, having JAMES LEONARD file SCSO-2020-003177, 
and then trying to have DEPUTY PIRRONE arrest me IMMEDIATELY AFTER I GAVE JULIE THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S9+?

It’s lookin’ like it’s this dude ERIC CATRICALA, ladies and gentleman.
Cool. A New York State Assemblyman, DEFINITELY tried to murder me. 
The locations in the next picture...

Coming back out for a second, ERIC CATRICALA was thinking: 
Eric : Ah man. 
       He is, NOT back here. 
       Fuckin’ a, man.
       *waits a minute*
       Somebody’s probably gonna SAY SOMETHING if I stay here TOO LONG...
       Guess I’ll try LOOKING ELSEWHERE.
       *pulls back out to the road*
       Man, WHERE did this MICHAEL C. COOK GUY actually GO...?
       *shakes head* 
       You know, his FATHER was a LOT EASIER to HAVE KILLED.
       *hesitates, second guesses himself*
       You know what....? 
       Let me check that spot AGAIN.
       This fuckin’ prick might be back there... so, I’ll look in the woods.
       There’s NO WAY that this STUPID SON OF A BITCH...
       ...KNEW I was gonna TURN AROUND to KILL HIM, is there...?
       That’s IMPOSSIBLE, right...?
       How would this dumb motherfucker know that...?
       *couple minutes goes by*
       Well, he’s definitely not back here, but- I need to make CERTAIN that he... 
       *shakes head* ...makes his way into a coffin or somethin’...?
       Maybe if I drive across the street to New Salem South...
       I could TRY and FAKE HIM OUT somehow.
       Alright, that’s what I’m gonna do.

Eric : You know...
       I do not see this fuckin’ kid.
       This is REALLY bad.
       Why did I actually wait so long...?
       If he gets to their house...?
       I won’t be able to KILL THIS FUCKIN’ KID without someone REALLY IMPORTANT KNOWING.
       I am gonna try my best, to FAKE HIM OUT... AGAIN.
       It DIDN’T WORK LAST TIME, but maybe, MAYBE, this time it will...
       I’ll just... drive all the way down this road...?
       ...and then, COME BACK AND SURPRISE THE SHIT OUT OF HIM~!
       *drives off, but I’m far too patient* 
       *I was actually walking AGAIN, but had to jump back in the woods*
       ...is this dude walkin’ around...?
       Holy hell dude, I gotta call SOMEBODY for help.

I saw the BLUE CAR again. The one I saw in the JONESVILLE video, as well as the WHITE CAR I believe.
Not one car was able to see me, because nah bro. Guy needed some fuckin’ night vision goggles or something, 
to find MY ass. I had every fucking expectation that I was gonna run into trouble, and this guy literally
made it pretty fuckin’ obvious.

The reason I had a bad feeling, is because it immediately reminded me of 05/26/20 AND, 06/16/20. Such as: 
-----------
(05/26/20): Recording a video of 2 dudes trying to kill me near the Catricala Funeral Home, 
(06/16/20): ALMOST killed by a FAKE COP, driving a FAKE COP CAR after LEAVING KEY BANK at 1703 US-9

This exact scenario went down in the letter I dropped off with Oliver Robinson, after I saw an SCSO vehicle
park in the middle of route 9 staring at me, only to turn around in the driving range parking lot. Just
so we’re clear here, this is a picture of the EXACT VEHICLE THAT I SAW...

I mean, one way they COULD’VE prevented me from FINDING this vehicle, OR, discovering the FRAUD SCHEME with the 
FAKE COP CAR, is to try a little bit harder at not being so fucking obvious. Ya know...? 

Like, had this Catricala dude NOT hit his fuckin brakes the way he did…
I may or may not have felt an IMPENDING SENSE OF DANGER. 
However, I don’t think he really expected me to be out there. Oh well man. Now you’re REAL fucked, dude.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
When I got to my aunt Nancy’s house, it was wicked late… so I passed out in the shed. 
The next morning, I tried to tell her what happened. I didn’t KNOW that it was ERIC CATRICALA.
The license plate wasn’t from HIS vehicle/white MERCEDES-BENZ SUV.

I believe I even gave her the plate # I found @ 1134 New Scotland Road, the BLACK DODGE DART above.
I mean, I probably would’ve forgotten about it if the SUV wasn’t ACTIVELY LOOKING LIKE IT WAS HUNTING ME DOWN.

What made matters FAR MORE COMPELLING FOR ME, was the fact that they were ATTACKING THE CABLE MODEM/COMPUTER.
I wound up working on the computer while I was there. They were doing everything they could, to slow me down.
Then, I spoke to my aunt Kathy from North Carolina... and while I was on the phone with her...?
I could hear the line being AGGRESSIVELY TAPPED.

Then, you’ll never believe how much more compelling all of this BECAME after she wound up driving me home...
Trooper Borden. Fucked it ALL up for ya...

$Book.AddSection(8,"June 22nd, 2020",@"
My aunt Nancy wound up driving me home. Wish my mother was as bright as she is, cause this woman actually 
sounds smart when she talks. You can tell someone is smart by the way they ask COMPLEX QUESTIONS, and 
provide RELEVANT STATEMENTS that fall in line with the direction of the conversation, so if this person 
isn’t asking questions in a state of facetiousness...? 

Then you know they’re not being a fuckin’ asshole like my mother can be.

(However, after the event that occurred on 06/28/22, my aunt Nancy and I aren’t getting’ along because 
she refused to listen to the AUDIO RECORDING of me and my mother ARGUING, and DIRECTLY CONTRADICTING the 
REPORT that NANCY believes is 100% accurate, cause she believes everything she is always told when someone
important lies to her. Cool. That's why the world is full of MORONS.)

I’m sure, whoever had my house BUGGED, they’ve heard the whole charade. Now everybody’s smartphone device 
can allow these intelligence agencies to provide microphone input UNWITTINGLY. That’s right. 
Anybody reading this that thinks to themselves “There’s NO way that they’re listening to ME on MY device…” 
Nah, there’s NO way that they would.

Except, ask yourself if it HAS a microphone. 
Does it have a microphone…? Alright, does it ALSO have a RADIO in it…?
Oh, then, you’re a fuckin moron. There IS a way they’re doing that, and not telling you.

They know that my mother is a total moron, so is my stepfather, so is my neighbor and his wife. 
This person hears very clearly that I SHOULD BE AN EASY KILL.
BUT- I haven’t actually died yet, so... still writin’ this whole biopic, fuckface.

Nancy and I spoke for a little bit on the way back to my house about public utilities, telephone poles, and 
internet. Basically talking about the things I was taking pictures of and researching because I knew that 
someone was doing something HIGHLY ILLEGAL. But, if it’s the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT that’s doing this HIGHLY 
ILLEGAL stuff...  does that mean they can just keep doing it...?

They want people to think “YEAH, THEY CAN.” But, NO THEY CAN’T.

As SOON AS I GOT HOME, I asked my MOTHER to use her phone, she said “NOPE.” 
I asked my stepfather to use HIS phone he said “NOPE”. 
I convinced my SON, to get a POLICE OFFICER TO THE HOUSE.

He called 911 like a good little boy, but I basically had to manipulate my own child because my mother and 
stepfather as well as a bunch of people in my community, have all been committing crimes to me and not caring.

Not really exaggerating that by much. At what point can I catch them all committing crimes together, and 
then get all of them in trouble...? 
The answer is that, this document needs to be written FIRST.

My son asked for TROOPER BORDEN, and TROOPER BORDEN was there in like *checks watch* about 3-5 minutes max.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

TROOPER BORDEN ARRIVED AND MY SON SHOWED HIM THE WRITTEN LICENSE PLATE.
Trooper Borden’s eyes WIDENED as SOON as he saw that PARTICULAR LICENSE PLATE, NYS/DVA-2450   (← INDICATES GUILT)
I am absolutely DEAD CERTAIN that is the CORRECT plate number.

They were probably swapping the plate between the Chargers sitting at the academy and the Dart.   (← NOT CERTAIN)
I know for a fact, that the event near New Salem was CONNECTED TO THE VIDEO I SHOWED TROOPER LEAVEY...
...since I recorded it right outside of the CATRICALA FUNERAL HOME, the place I went to on 05/24/20 1700ish.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Borden : *eyes widen* Where did you get that license plate number from...?
Me     : Well, I did YOUR job, and fuckin’ found it, actually.
         I got it from the vehicle that some douchebag was driving.
         Don’t actually need the video anymore to:
         ASSOCIATE the SUSPECT to the CRIME, to make a CRIMINAL ACCUSATION
         ---------     -------        -----            -------------------
Borden : You realize who that is, don’t you...?
Me     : Nah, I’d like for you to run the plate number, right now.
Borden : I can actually get in trouble for running plate numbers.
Me     : So, you are REFUSING to run a suspects PLATE NUMBER, in front of ME, and my SON...?
Borden : Yeah.

Over time, I just started to drop the idea that I have to be nice to people. 
Cause, when I’m nice, people will do what Trooper Borden did on June 18th, 2020 @ GT Toys. 
Lying to my face.

When I’m nice, people will say "Oh, well whatever bro~!"
But if *I* start getting CRASS with somebody...? 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Them : Whoa buddy... 
       Sounds like you’re getting’ REAL crass with me...
       Who do you think you’re talking to...?
Me   : I’m glad you asked. 
       I’m pretty sure I’m talking to someone who might get knocked the fuck out in a second...
       ...if they don’t drop their fuckin’ condescending attitude REAL quick.
Them : Oh... 
       ...didn’t realize you had a nutsack. 
       Just, thought you were a total idiot.
       Sorry.
Me   : *cocks head slightly* Well, now ya know.

Did I tell people that the Russians were targeting me BEFORE Solorigate...?
Ah, yeah I fucking DEFINITELY did. Wow. Amazing.

MARK SHEEHAN sorta did me a solid by WRITING THAT in the report (SCSO-2020-003564 06/13/20)
The only thing that’s accurate on MARK SHEEHAN’s report, is that I did tell Mark that I was being censored
by the US Government and the Russians were hacking/attacking me too. 

So, to recap, I was being 1) censored, and 2) attacked by Russians.
That’s like 6, count that...? 6... total months, where I was surrounded by morons, and nobody admitted it. 
Cool~!
To be fair, it’s probably rude for me to explain to people HOW and/or WHY they were morons...
You know? Maybe you’re only allowed to be right if you’re an attractive person. If you’re not...? 
Oh well, dude. You can’t be right, ever. Even if you ARE right, well, someone can abuse their reputation.
And then, straight up attempt to murder people. Be so openly blatant about it, and call it a funeral home.

These people may have committed the worst cyberattack in the history of the united states, and I know how and 
why it happened, but when I tell other people, they look at me in disbelief because how the hell could some 
scruffy lookin’ motherfucker like myself, be smarter and have more of my facts straight, than people that 
make `$150K a year if not a hell of a lot more...?

The answer is that... I don’t gloss over details. That’s why. 
These people in Russia, like the guys in APT29 or Cerberus, they commit cyberattacks, identity theft, and...   
espionage. They are EXTREMELY successful at ALL of these things, because most Americans are very careless.
That doesn’t change the fact that they think they’re SO slick, right...?  
But, I literally caught a State Assemblyman using a combination of techniques to outsmart me, to kill me, 
and yet this man fucking adamantly failed. I know he’ll try again, or have someone else do it.

They’re not too slick for me. If I get the FEELING like I’m being watched or whatever...?
I don’t ignore that at all.

The police...? They’re TYPICALLY morons, and they’re TYPICALLY not very thorough.
They will never catch these cybercriminals, UNLESS, someone TEACHES them how to do such a thing, effectively.
Sometimes that involves NOT ACCEPTING BRIBERY.

The ones that DO accept bribery, they CUT CORNERS and that AUTOMATICALLY MEANS: 
- they’re not SMART       enough to catch these people
- they’re not INTELLIGENT enough to catch these people
- they don’t know how to look for PATTERNS. 
- they LIE a lot, 
- they would rather sit at a U-TURN all day and catch people speeding 
- if you tell them to go EAT SOME DONUTS, they’ll do that - sometimes they’ll say “Already doin that.” 

THEY do not EVER catch these people, ever. 
Why...? Because I have literally seen most of them IGNORE EVIDENCE and LEADS.
They don’t even CARE if they catch these people...
They’re taking BRIBES... all they have to do is the bare minimum.
That’s why I have to make an example out of some LOCAL COPS.
If it sounds like I have an axe to grind? I do. Most of them don’t give a flying fuck.

None of the people THEY know EVER catch them.  
Even if you gave them the ADDRESS or LICENSE PLATE of someone who did something ILLEGAL... 
they will ONLY stare at that information... they aren’t even allowed to TOUCH something that could be 
considered evidence. Not even exaggerating. Some of them are literally so brain dead, that you can PLUG A 
BATTERY BACK INTO A PHONE, WHILE THEY ARE WATCHING, and then as soon as the device powers up again...? 

They’ll literally ask:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Trooper Carter : How did you get the date to show up like that...?
Me             : Uh, well moron... 
                 It’s cause I plugged the fucking battery back into the logic board.
                 You just WATCHED ME DO IT.
Trooper Carter : Whatever dude.
                 I have more donuts to go eat.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

I don’t particularly enjoy when a cop BROW BEATS ME WHEN I’M HOLDING EVIDENCE AND PICTURES.
Cause a dude like that will fuckin’ ARGUE with me, and say “I DONT THINK THATS ACTUAL EVIDENCE.”
But he will SAY THAT, before LOOKING AT IT.

I’m probably a moron too, but I’m still smarter than most of these dudes with their badges and shit.

These people are slick, but not too slick for me anymore... though they sure as hell try.
Unless you’re like me, and you expect them to try again at any fuckin’ moment...? They will fucking win 
every time. That’s why people will say "if they wanted you, they would’ve gotten you by now".   (← FALLACY ALERT)

In my case, I’ve been "nearly gotten" many, many times. 
Each fuckin’ time, when I retell the story, people shake their head because they don’t know how some 
scruffy lookin’ motherfucker like me, managed to get away from these fucks.
    
The reason why some people would rather make MY life a living hell, or ignore me, isn’t because I’m really 
all that IMPORTANT, COOL, RICH, or FAMOUS, so much as it is that I know how to manipulate people, using only 
WORDS. You’ve gotta figure, I’m not threatening to hurt anybody unless I know they’re gonna be a douchebag to 
my face or lie to me. I’m not gonna wind up taking somebody’s life by punching them in the face. 

Probably sounds horrendous to guys like Richard Todd Loeber, cause that dude would probably shatter into a 
million fragile little pieces if I even GRAZED this dude with (1) swing. 

That...
Probably sounds ridiculous. 
Dude shattering into a million pieces, for grazing his shoulder...?
I mean, that sounds like it must be traumatic for RICHARD TODD LOEBER to experience something that excessive.

However, I’m not exaggerating at all. 
He probably DOES think that’ll happen. 
Even with his PhD in “psychiatry”, he really needs to go back to school, and read what’s INSIDE of a DSM5.
In other words, he’s a fuckin’ moron. 

Not a very attentive doctor, probably sucks ass at driving his blue 2017 Audi S7, probably could stand to be 
shown how an expert can drive the shit out of that car he’s got. I could actually show him how to 1) be a lot 
better at being a PSYCHIATRIST/PSYCHOLOGIST, and even 2) how to drive that fuckin’ car. 
Like I’m an EXPERT at both, and don’t have a doctorate. 
That’s gotta suck when someone who DOES NOT HAVE a DOCTORATE, says:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Me     : Here, you really suck ass at PSYCHIATRY, allow me to show you how to do that correctly.
Loeber : Really...?
Me     : Yeah, cocksucker.
         Like, you’re not very good at reading people’s body language, are ya...?
Loeber : I thought we were buddies, dude...
         *crying* You’re really hurting my feelings.
Me     : I... don’t really fuckin’ care, man.
         You’re one of the biggest pussies I’ve ever met in my entire life, and you suck ass at being a doctor.
         Want me to show you how to drive that Audi...?
         Cause I can guarantee you, I’m a lot better than you at everything you do.
         Even banging a girl, I will show you how to do that even better.
Loeber : You’re treating me like this because I committed medical fraud against you, aren’t ya...?
Me     : Well, a lot more than that dickface.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

As far as I can tell, it is possible to cause a guy like HIM, to explode into billions of pieces with a light 
tap on the shoulder. Ya know, my cousin Ryan might be a permanent threat... but, he’s no pussy. He would not 
hesitate for an opportunity to fight somebody. 

However, Richard Todd Loeber is on the exact opposite end of the spectrum. He is terrified of someone even 
LOOKING at him in an ALMOST intense way. Probably sounds like I’m making this dude out to be the biggest 
pussy that ever lived, right...? Well, that is exactly what I’m doing... but also, it’s extremely accurate.

Maybe someday he’ll stop committing medical fraud, and maybe even grow a pair of nuts. MAYBE, he could stop 
being a such a whiny little lying bitch. But, I doubt he’ll ever make that decision. Till then...? He’s gonna 
drive that Audi so carefully, that ANY little bump in the road he manages to hit...? ‘FUCK, hit a pothole...’

Guys like him are big pussies, is basically what I’m saying. 
Born to BE one...? Never gonna stop being one till he kicks the bucket, I guess.
That dude doesn’t tell people the truth. 
I don’t want him to feel SCARED or SHIT HIS PANTS, like Bob Lutz does... 

Because, at least RICHARD TODD LOEBER actually bought a decent vehicle that REAL car experts made. 
Bob Lutz could never make this car if his life depended on it, and that’s saying something since he worked at
GM for about 50 years, DIRECTING THE COMPANY. 

Those experts that made the Audi, they’re in Germany. 
They know how to make a GOOD fuckin’ car. 
Unless you’re rich, or you’re going with stock cars, then Americans don’t make quality cars like they used to.
Except Tesla, they make the FASTEST PRODUCTION CAR IN THE WORLD, now. https://youtu.be/Ujp3q_aryRA

So, if you’re NOT throwing around a lot of money...? 
Then, they won’t build them well at all. 
But if you ARE throwing around a lot of money...? 
Then, they will build a decent vehicle.

NASCAR, doesn’t use shit cars... they’re pretty good...
...but NONE of them are as FAST as ^ that battery powered Tesla.
Seriously, it’s almost like NASCAR should consider upgrading to something cooler than gasoline powered cars.
The gasoline in these cars actually causes the vehicle to EXPLODE or CATCH FIRE in some accidents.
Battery powered cars can, in some cases, burn even worse, however- they don’t EXPLODE. 
Maybe I’m wrong about that…

Hertz, Enterprise, etc. DOES use shit cars. Not their fault, American cars are made to last about 5 years.
That means, they’re built to IMMEDIATELY SUCK ASS AFTER 5 years.

Might be a real decent set of wheels up until the 4th year, 364th day... as soon as that last day is over...?
It will fall apart right there and then, maybe it’ll be a blown motor or transmission, or both.
Then you’re REAL fucked, dude.

They COULD make em last a hell of a lot longer, like the experts in Germany think to do... but- the only 
American auto maker worth a damn is... *drum roll* Tesla. That’s it. 

Only manufacturer worth paying attention to anymore, in America. 
MAYBE I’ll start to cut these companies some slack when they COMPLETELY STOP MAKING ICE VEHICLES.
Sorry Ford, I know they’re trying... 
But like, this dude started this electric car company like *15 years ago* and even Arnold Shwarzenegger told 
people that the 2006 Tesla Roadster kicked ass, and took names... "I drove it... it’s hot."

What if Bob took a moment to stop shitting his pants every day at GM...
...and built that thing FIRST, way back in the 80’s...?
Well, this dipshit actually DID try to do that. 
Bob’s made more electric vehicles than any other automaker in the world.
Bob, tried to make an electric car, many, many times, but every single one of em’ sucked ass...
...because there was always a problem with the batteries.

Not his fault, his best engineers never met with the ACTUAL experts that Elon Musk did.
Which is sayin’ something, isn’t it...?
Spent like 50 years not talking to anybody who happened to be as highly skilled, as the guys Elon Musk met.
Now, Tesla has the fastest car in the world.
This one car alone, is pissing off a lot of guys that spend all their life, tuning engines and stuff.
It’s almost like people will give a shit when all the oil runs out at some point.

Well... nah, people won’t give a shit about ICE cars when OIL IS ALL GONE.
That’s not an IF we run out, it’s a WHEN. (← That’s why it’s worth making fun of them)

Bob, knew that battery development would inevitably be needed at some point, oil wouldn’t be around forever.
However, building electric cars was probably really costly and challenging... 
...and you need experts that actually know what the hell they’re doing, to build good batteries.
Bob knew he didn’t have any of those... didn’t feel like stepping on Duracell or Energizers toes.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Bob: Fuck it. 
     I’ll just shit my pants again at 1045AM...?
     ...clean up...?
     ...and draw a fuckin’ line on the engineering blueprints.
     It’s what I’m the best at.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

That’s why I say that Bob Lutz shit his pants every day for 50 years straight. 
He didn’t actually shit his pants every day LITERALLY, it’s a metaphor... for the shit quality cars he DID make.
I still cannot fuckin’ believe, just how many people were SHORT SELLING TESLA, and TALKING SHIT ABOUT TESLA... 
...such as this fuckin’ quiver lipped fuckface Bob Lutz. 
"Why don’t you show us mortals how to run a car company"...?

Heh. Allow me to convey how *I* felt, when that dude fuckin’ said that.
I bought a 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix, biggest fucking waste of my money, ever. `$17K for the car, with an extended
warranty... wound up being upside down on my loan when I had to replace the 
1) engine and then the 2) transmission...
(6) months later, still short of paying off the vehicle by a year. 
So, when this cocksucker said "Why don’t you show us mortals how to run a car company..."

| <insert hyperlink> | 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix
I thought, "Maybe you should stop shitting in your pants. While you’re at it...? Take your own fuckin’ advice."

Bill Cass’ Northstar Chevrolet, where I purchased the vehicle, was told of recurring issues to my piece of shit car.

It had 280K miles by the time I got rid of it.
The engine needed replacement at 107K.
The transmission needed replacement at 130K.
That’s because General Motors makes shitty vehicles that are DESIGNED to BREAK A LOT… as they make more $ that way.

Installed a body kit which was a fuckin’ moronic idea, and custom springs in the back so I could load additional
weight in the trunk. It WAS a pretty cool car... WAS.

They pretended like they “fixed” my car every time I brought it in, for service. 
They didn’t fix the car. Wasn’t the only GM vehicle I’ve owned, as I’ve owned about (8) of them.
    
Well, I can’t remember exactly WHEN Bob Lutz said “Show us mortals how to run a car company”, but...
I remember the week or month where Tesla was like running [average stock price*].
Then like within a week, [the value of the fucking stock like tripled*] or perhaps even MORE than that...
Wanna know why...?

It’s cause the [short sellers*], as in, 
the [assholes that make money off of betting AGAINST products/people*]...? 

They kept [LOSING A LOT OF MONEY*]. 

Yeah, they don’t tell people this, but when you bet AGAINST people, you can cause them to go out of 
business because they might not be performing all that well. 

But- if they CONTINUE to perform [EXTREMELY WELL], 
then the [short sellers are LITERALLY BURNING THEIR CASH/HELPING THEIR COMPETITION*].

Bob Lutz was probably one of those people, talking shit to this dude Elon Musk... 
...telling him he sucks ass at making cars, betting AGAINST him, and ALSO making a SIDE BET... 
...that he’d get cleaned out, instead of waiting till he was on the toilet to let HIMSELF get cleaned out. 
Ya know…?

Well, once they ALL realized how fuckin’ stupid it was, to keep betting against Tesla... 
...they all said "Fuck it, I’m not gonna keep SHORT SELLING TESLA... I’m losing SO MUCH MONEY..." 

That’s when suddenly, Bob Lutz realized that even though he ran GM for 50 years, and thought he was the 
king of car manufacturing...? 
The newcomer suddenly had some SERIOIUS PROFITS and was DWARFING what GM brought in. 

Almost as if some cocksucker kept shittin’ his pants on a daily basis for 50 years making a LOT of 
terrible vehicles. 
He was ONLY successful at causing competitors to say “This is basically impossible dude, wtf.”

That’s because Bob knew he didn’t need to have TALENT.
The real reason why Tesla’s stock surged up like `$250B in valuation, is because after the battery 
development, electric vehicles, are MORE PROFITABLE than internal combustion engine vehicles. 

That’s weird... right?
I mean, if the ELECTRIC VEHICLES are actually A LOT MORE PROFITABLE, why even bother making internal 
combustion engine vehicles...? The answer is that guys like Bob Lutz are fuckin’ morons. That’s why.

It’s all because of the oil companies, that’s it. You don’t even need to be intelligent, you just do what 
they want you to do, and they will take care of the rest. That’s how Exxon Mobil has always been.

You would think that Bob Lutz knew this shit...? That, making decent electric vehicles would’ve put more 
money in his pocket...? Well, he probably did. He just didn’t give a shit. I don’t get it. 

Do something that creates more POLLUTION and DESTROYS THE PLANET WITH GLOBAL WARMING... OR, make more 
environmentally friendly, AND profitable vehicles...?

WELL, sometimes you really can’t stop someone from making additional retarded decisions.
That’s just humanity has always been. 

If someone wants to be a fuckin’ moron...? 
They have a right to do that.
Who the hell would anyone really be, to tell someone like Bob Lutz, that he’s a fuckin’ moron...?

I’ll tell ya, when a company is finally doing really fucking well, people get to see a magic number come 
out of thin air. Much how I know that the people I went to school with are sort of on the fence about me...
...particularly...? I know that once someone really fuckin’ important acknowledges my existence...
...and realizes that I’m a cut above the rest...
...a bunch of people will suddenly realize: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

People: Wow. 
        *points at me* I know that guy, holy fuck...~! 
        Went to school with him and stuff... 
        Amazing guy, always has been.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

When they say that though, I’m gonna say something like 
"Oh you remember the kid that they fuckin’ left out of the senior yearbook…?" 

Uh-oh. Now, I’ve openly accused the girls who edited the yearbook, that every single one of em is a fuckin’ 
<unspecified> for not putting a single picture of me in the yearbook. Couldn’t be more serious, to be 
completely honest.

They may be offended when I say those words out loud, right...? 
But, I attended the fuckin’ school for 13 years. 
They have like 3 pictures of my cousin, 12 of like every girl in the yearbook club, if not more...
But, not (1) single god damn picture of me, at all. 
Cool. Glad I went to a school that excluded me the whole time.

Jeff Truesell found out the hard way, that I was ready and willing to hurt people that kept disrespecting 
me. It didn’t stop people from doing that ANYWAY. However, it was pretty apparent to me, that everything 
continued to be this series of kids at high school that kept "short selling Tesla". 

A lot of people were afraid of me after I put this kid down, much in the same exact manner that many people 
were afraid of Tesla after its stock suddenly jumped like `$250B in value.

That’s weird, right? That people would work so hard against Tesla, that when the resistance collapsed, wow... 
`$250B appeared out of thin air~! 

That’s because people were clinging onto their pride, AND the (old fashioned/retarded) way of doing things.
For instance, telling themselves and everyone else, that (2 + 2 = 5). 
They don’t realize how retarded that is.
2 plus 2 does not equal 5, unless you have an additional something to add, such as the number 1. 
But that changes the equation, entirely. It’s not (2 + 2 = 5) anymore... Nah. It’s (2 + 2 + 1 = 5)

I’m not gonna go around telling all of em to their faces, that I’m not real pleased with how my peers treated 
me in high school, because I really don’t give a shit. It’s not resentment either. Many of them were a lot 
better off than I was, they probably didn’t care that my father was EXECUTED, and thus, that means they were
more important than I ever was. To them...? Respect is a ONE-WAY-STREET. That’s how stupid some people are.

When I say that out loud though, I’m fuckin’ absolutely certain some of those cunts may say "That’s correct."
Nah, it isn’t. (2 + 2 = 4), doesn’t equal 5. Just like respect is NOT a ONE-WAY-STREET, it’s a TWO-WAY-STREET.

Cause, [some people aren’t fuckin’ intelligent*], man.
I hate to like come right out and say it, but even the state police, the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office,
some of the people I went to high school with, maybe I’m the only person on Earth who’s not a dumbass. 
[I know that’s not accurate at all*], but, I really do think that people around CLIFTON PARK, are OBLIVIOUS.

ALL of these people, would rather that I continue to insult them, over and over again, specifically... than 
to apologize to me. Why...? Because they would be embarrassed to death, frankly. I don’t know. 

These girls that edited the god damn yearbook and left me out of it, probably thought nothing of it.

Yearbook Girl : Oh well. 
                Left ya outta the yearbook. 
                Grow the fuck up, dude.
                You act like you’re important enough to be in it.
                Or, like you went to the Shen for 13 years.
Me            : Yeah.
                K-12 actually.
                You ever like, done math by any chance...?
Yearbook Girl : *crosses arms* You’re like, being REALLY RUDE right now...
                So...
Me            : OH... MY BAD.
                Here, allow me to get you a gold tissue so that you can CRY ABOUT IT.
Yearbook Girl : Really...? You would actually give me a gold tissue to cry with...?
Me            : Sure. Why not...?
Yearbook Girl : Why would you wanna make me cry though, I was always nice to YOU and EVERYONE ELSE...
                *starting to cry* 
                IT’S NOT FAIR~!
Me            : Oh, cool... 
                That’s like, exactly how my DAUGHTER would act.
                OoOooOOoHhhHh some mean boy said something really mean to me, what a mean faced meanie...
Yearbook Girl : *starts bawling her eyes out* I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU, DUDE~!
Me            : You... left me out of the yearbook. Pretty good reason for me to be pissed at you.
Yearbook Girl : DIDN’T DO IT ON PURPOSE~!
Me            : Sounds almost like you tripped, fell, and landed on some dude’s dick, now you’re suckin’ on it.
                Just like Eminem said.
                Basically, the tears, and the lies don’t really work on people like me.
Yearbook Girl : *stops fake crying* Whatever, dude. Where’s that gold tissue...?
Me            : Ah, I mean, I was just being sarcastic, but I’m glad that you said that... cause, just made 
                my argument even more compelling...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
               
Now look. Am I basically treating this girl like I’m gonna piss in her dollhouse teapot...? 
Yeah, I sorta am acting like that, cause, that would be a pretty mean thing to do. 
But, I have to consider that this person has GROWN UP just like I have...
And, still... has never once in their entire life, had an actual dude’s dick thrown in them in such a way, 
that it caused em to have a really violent orgasm... like the one I talked about in the Judge Pelagalli scene. 
Ya know...? They’re probably gonna wonder what THAT’S like.

Might be exaggerating about that, some of them probably are mad nice and made an honest mistake, but I know a
couple of them actually WORKED PRETTY HARD TO EXCLUDE ME.
    
I know I’m coming off as pretty fuckin’ arrogant right now, but- I’ve got plenty of reasons to be.
ERIC CATRICALA had his buddies DISABLE my SMARTPHONE to prevent me from showing ADDITIONAL PEOPLE the VIDEO.
But also, not one fuckin’ picture of me in the yearbook. 
Not one fuckin’ person stood up for me. 
Not in any way that I can remember vividly, back THEN, nor in the last couple years.

The parallel is this... 
ERIC CATRICALA and BRUCE TANSKI are gonna wind up regretting how far they went.
The yearbook girls are ALSO gonna wind up regretting being quite inconsiderate of how I felt.
And, that `$250B that Tesla shot up after Bob Lutz ran his fuckin’ mouth? 

What I do remember, are a lot of people joining in, antagonizing me... 
Not caring about what I was going through. 
Some people still do that, too.

It’s OK if I tell people over and over, that certain people are fuckin’ morons.
Ya know? Whether that’s ERIC CATRICALA, BRUCE TANSKI, JOHN HOFFMAN, doesn’t really matter.
Most people will be scared of people that have money.
Unless you’re smarter than they are. Then, that money doesn’t really matter.
That’s the trick.

Elon Musk had to deal with Tesla being short sold by people that were too fuckin’ proud to admit that maybe 
he’s actually A GENIUS. And, more skilled at making cars. That’s not the only reason WHY he eventually 
became the richest man in the world.
Wasn’t JUST cause he got "lucky"... 
Wasn’t JUST cause he "worked his ass off" either... 
Wasn’t JUST cause he’s "smarter than most people"... 
But rather... ALL OF THOSE THINGS COMBINED.
He did get lucky.

He met some people that were actually very intelligent and had a solid fucking plan, and he... 
...put everything he fuckin’ had into those ideas. Now look at him.

You’ll never catch somebody who’s been an entitled fucking brat their entire life, ever doing those things.
    
What this man did SPECIFICALLY to Bob Lutz, is... make some old man who ran GM for 50 fuckin’ years, look 
like a total fuckin’ loser. Yeah. Bob Lutz, nobody has ever seen this dude in public for like, years. 
Wanna know why...?
    
Sending Starman into space... It’s just gonna be a jarring attitude adjustment for some dipshit that he 
sorely underestimated. That was the biggest middle finger in all middlefingerhood, directed right at some 
dude who shat his pants for 50 fuckin’ years, and called that “the best in the industry”.

SCSO, might not understand that. Using WORDS, and ONLY words... 
I can manipulate the most powerful people on Earth, and it’s not that hard to do when I continue to refer to 
someone like Elon Musk.
    
First man that made the world’s reflyable building. That may sound like total fuckin’ nonsense to people...
Until they say to themselves what Dwayne Coonradt would: "Wait a minute, that kid is a lot smarter than I 
fuckin’ am... maybe he’s onto something..." Yeah. People actually think that in their head, when they hear 
about me.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Dwayne : Wait, that kid that’s a lot smarter than I’ll EVER be...?
         He said that Elon Musk developed the world’s first reflyable building...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Sorta how like a mentally challenged person needs to have a joke explained to them, Dwayne doesn’t understand
what the world’s first reflyable building, is. But- it is exactly what it sounds like. It is a BUILDING... 
...that can FLY MULTIPLE TIMES.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Dwayne : Wow. 
         How does it do that, though...?
Me     : Well, bro... 
         ...it doesn’t have to fuckin’ steal components out of customers’ devices or anything...
         ...cause it is literally a rocket that can 1) take-off, 2) land, 3) be fueled again, and 4) repeat.
Dwayne : But, I don’t get it, what makes it a BUILDING...?
Me     : The fact that it’s fuckin’ 25 stories high...
Dwayne : ...that doesn’t make it a BUILDING though...
Me     : Yeah, it sorta does.
         It’s literally 25 stories tall.
         That’s basically “a building”.
Dwayne : Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh.
         So like, somebody built it, to be a building and it flies...?
Me     : Nah man, I’m … done.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Yeah, worlds first reflyable fucking building, it’s a pretty substantial achievement.
But, it’s such a slick clever way to say something larger than Saturn V and is actually 25 stories high.
Somebody might say “That’s fuckin impressive.” No shit. 

Dude ran Tesla WHILE conceptualizing this fuckin’ thing, all while Bob Lutz ran shit down his leg.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Smarter People Exist",@"
I’m gonna segue here, cause, I have more important shit to say, then telling a bunch of people, that smarter 
people exist... 
    
These dudes who abused this program outside of Computer Answers, at some point, they’re gonna try and be slick, 
and kill me again. They’re not going to make any fuckin’ mistakes if they choose to do so again. Unless they do.

With these new smartphones and since the mass shooting in San Bernadino, California, the government found ways 
around the security locks on smartphones.
    
The girl “Keila” from the Apple Store in Crossgates, she had no idea that I called Apple back in June 2019, 
and told them that my phone was crashing. Someone had already hacked my device, they installed IRREMOVABLE 
CONTACTS, and when launching certain applications on the phone, the application would crash and revert back
to the desktop AFTER flashing with a BLACK SCREEN for a real quick window (several milliseconds, maybe...?)

Anyway, I had a feeling that someone hacked my device back in April 2019. 
So, I made a fuckin’ recording of it. 
Then, I showed it to this girl, when she remotely connected to my iPhone.
None of these people at Apple really give a shit about Pegasus, nor how dangerous it is. 
Otherwise, they would’ve known about this shit beforehand.

The reason why they’re DENYING that it exists, is because people are morons.
Unbeknownst to MICHAEL ZURLO, or anyone else at SCSO, I actually called the National Security Agency in 2019.
Pretty sure they’re a lot more important than anyone at SCSO. 

Doesn’t mean I have a working relationship with them... but I have contacted them, told em my name, and they 
have talked right back, and said a minimum number of things needed to convey that they agreed with things I 
said. I called them and said some things about 9/11.

They recorded me for 13 minutes until I stated my aunts name, and then they disconnected the call.
Afterward... I noticed some incredibly disturbing things, because I have a habit of telling people like 
Linus Sebastian, that he would stand to gain my respect, by not sucking Asus’s dick for free shit all the time. 
He didn’t like that. I wonder why, really... 

They can deploy software that enables them to pull the password off of the device, whereby allowing remote 
entry. Sometimes it’s literally as simple as Tim Cook, handing an FBI man a specific login. Other times, the 
NSA will call Tim Cook a cocksucker for pretending like he gives a shit about his users, and said "NO" to 
a request or gag order... 

While I don’t think that Linus Sebastian has the technical skills to be able to do this shit, he might know 
some people that do. But, even then, it makes a lot more sense to me, that someone at the NSA would do 
something like that, because a guy like Edward Snowden told people it was bound to happen... nobody really 
put a lot of thought into it. I kept it in the back of my mind, but didn’t understand WHY it was so important.

Now, I most definitely do. 
Tim Cook could be giving users information and shit to personal military contractors, and then lie about 
doing that while being a `$3T company. None of that appears coincidental to anybody.

Tim responds to every gag order, I don’t think he ever says no in real life.
So, when some dude says "Hey, wanna choke on a big fat D...?" 
Well, he really likes the way that sounds, and NOW his pants are wet, so OF COURSE he does...

Dude would earn my respect if someone at Apple who was an actual expert, assisted me in extracting the 
fucking video on my disabled iPhone. But amazingly, some jizz-lipped fuckin’ cuntface, is gonna tell me 
‘that’s impossible’... Meanwhile that `$3T that Apple is worth looks more and more suspicious.

Nobody drawing the connection I’m making here. I could literally say the sentence over and over again... 
And for some reason, some jizz-lipped fuckin’ cuntface, isn’t gonna hear the theme I’m making across this 
entire document.

What if Apple does this, they hire private military contractors to hack into their devices, right...?
And then they just kill your ass because they can. 
You made fun of the iPhone 13... they put a LOT of HARD WORK, and BULLSHIT into that thing.
So, that’s basically worth killing you...
Now you’re REAL fucked, dude.
    
I really don’t think Linus Sebastian would ever choke on a big fat D in reference to any of the people over 
at Asus, but... somebody didn’t like the IDENTITY THEFT posts I kept trying to repost, way back when I was 
in Bennington. And, now I have this video of Asus acting like a bunch of morons, cause they decided to be 
as gay as Tim Cook, and then they deployed a spiked UEFI BIOS to my Q504UA laptop. I still have that video. 

Nobody knowledgeable nor helpful has come along quite yet, that knows how to update the BIOS for that specific
laptop. That would include the people at Asus R&D, the people that made every other version beforehand. 
You would THINK that THEY would know how to do that? But, you gotta suck their dick like Linus Sebastian does.
THEN they’ll actually do an amazing job of writing firmware that doesn’t have UEFI/BIOS firmware w/ persistent
MALWARE on it. Yeah. That’s what they do. They deploy MALWARE in the actual UEFI/BIOS on some models. 

Now that I kept saying it...?
OH. Some people are actually watching a few cocksuckers over at Asus. Huh.
I just have to find a compelling way to LINK/MERGE BRUCE TANSKI, and KEY BANK, and ASUS.
Hm. How could I really do that...?

There really are a lot of entitled fuckin’ brats with less experience than I have in this world, pretending 
like they didn’t 1) hear me insult them, or 2) that I exist. I’m not gonna say that Linus is one of em, even
though I know he probably asked his buddies at Google to be a dick to me. And that’s fine. 
That’s gonna backfire.

Innocent people get shot to death sometimes... people DID hear something being said, but pretended as if they
DIDN’T. People heard someone damn well. But- BECAUSE they PREFERRED to keep choking on a big fat d...? 
They never paused for a moment at all, to STOP choking on it, say "Alright, heard ya.", and then, if they 
wanted to returned to chokin’ on a massive penis some more...? That’s totally their prerogative.
That gag order of theirs, is the same exact thing. See no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil... Malice.

Malice, is basically a girl that is stuck in an abusive BDSM relationship where she willingly asks to be tied,
gagged, and bound... cause it is totally erotic for HER. That’s what the justice system is sometimes.

Allow me to clarify... I already wrote this shit earlier.
It’s not a crime at all, if someone chooses to gag on somebody’s dick.
It might be indecent exposure if you do that in public...? 
But, other than that...? It’s not a crime at all.
Hannity has never gotten arrested for it.
So...

Most people don’t know this, but I am an apex predator.
What that means is, some dude like Pavel Zaichenko, should be gravely concerned about someone like me, 
telling everybody HOW that dude lies to everyone... and even though he might be twice my size...?  
He’s still a bisexual individual, I believe. 
So, if I somehow felt an urge to follow through on smacking the shit out of him, since he said that to me
so many fuckin’ times... he’s not likely to get up, cause, I really can’t specify what WILL happen, but...
...I can guarantee he won’t be expecting it.

Dude would literally tell me that he would kick the shit out of me sometimes, but when I say it back he’s... 
suddenly scared shitless and gets off the phone.
    
Because trying to talk to him causes him to prove to me again, he starts to sound very afraid of me. 
That’s why he gets off the phone mad quick.
He’s no idiot actually. 
If he thinks that, he can’t be fuckin’ stupid after all.
But, I have to hold onto some notion, that this dude just LOOKED like he was in the wrong place at the 
wrong time, and just CONVENIENTLY appeared to be involved in a CYBERATTACK against that Bennington store... 
And because it’s appears to be POINTLESS to go to the FBI for help...? 
    
That’s why it’s likely, that if I have to repeat what I did to some kid that molested me when I was a child... 
(Jeff Truesell)
Well, Pavel probably will underestimate me just like Jeff did.

Nothing quite causing somebody who’s twice your size, to be terrified of you. That’s Pavel. 
Truth be told, I’d rather find who he had hack my equipment, over in Russia.
I know that my cousin Ryan and his buddies hacked my equipment.
But, I am certain that Pavel’s buddies over in Russia ALSO hacked me, because I kept running Traceroutes 
for a while. Traceroutes basically point to a location between one point and another.

I’d rather find out who he had ATTACKING me, in Russia, fly over to Russia... 
...and just clean house. When the FBI was scared shitless...? Ryan Ward actually wanted to go with me. 
There I was, telling VLADIMIR PUTIN what a fuckin’ cocksucker he is, not only will I kick the shit out of the 
polar bears, but then I’ll kick the shit out of Vladimir too. Then I’ll make him watch me bang his fuckin’
girlfriend, and both of his daughters. Twice.
Make all three of em wait in line.

What the fuck could the president of Russia really do about that...?
Oh, well... if he was MY president, he could do all sorts of shit.
Cause he is a sick fuck.
But since I’m an American, he’ll be afraid to lift a finger, cause that’s what a bitch he is.
Just gonna bang the snot out of his (girlfriend/two daughters), TWICE...
...and he’s gonna feel like Bob Lutz does when he really doesn’t wanna shit his pants, but then he does.
    
The FBI likes this idea... 
They may not like some of the shit I say... but that paragraph right there, probably makes them all laugh 
profusely. Because, they’re probably terrified of doing that.

So is really anybody else. 
It is a suicide mission. No shit. 

But that’s what it means to ‘serve your country’, you’re willing to fly over, and stomp the ever living 
shit out of a man that just mows down innocent civilians in Ukraine. 

I’d be assisting Zelensky beat the fuck out of a tyrant, one who had something to do with a bunch 
of cyberattacks that Paul Pellagalli would never fuckin’ find himself doing a thing about, if his life 
depended on it... Cause why?

He’d rather prevent me from being allowed in my own trial. Yeah, fire a public defender like the one I had, 
the public defender’s office will switch it to some other guy that tells me he’s gonna call me- but then 
doesn’t fuckin’ do that at all. When I call his ass 500+ times, oh, I didn’t call 501 times. 

My bad. Then when I go to tell people at the court, they don’t realize how many recordings I have of them 
sounding like they’re contradicting themselves. Whether is the main receptionist, or it’s Dennis Bruce, 
they don’t care if I have something that makes that court look like a fuckin’ joke.

That would probably cause Paul Pelagalli to shit his pants just like Bob Lutz did at GM for over 50 years.
The polar bear would probably be the first thing that would get Judge Pelagalli...

Thing is, I can stand to be corrected, but when I show up on forum like Linus Tech Tips, what happens is I 
probably have more experience than all of the people on the forum, and if it existed way back in 2001 when 
I ran a site on Planetquake, would’ve probably been more experienced than all of em THEN too. 

Anyway, no doubt I probably caused a grown man to cry... and I apologize. 

Didn’t mean to make Linus Sebastian cry in a quiet room where no one would see him. 
Nor Mark Zuckerberg… Sorry guys. 

Didn’t realize I was being so inconsiderate/rude while people were being victimized. 
But, these guys on YouTube, sometimes they hear somebody loudly and clearly. 
They may not read EVERY comment if they have 1.7M+ subscribers, but, they’ll still get some messages and 
be hesitant to respond. Why? "Oh, you think I read EVERYBODY’s comments?" No. 

Pretty sure they saw the video where I said a bunch of shit about Google, privacy policy, and him. 
They were acting like children, prompting me into making the video. 
Why did I keep doing that? 
Identity theft, and the national debt, being exacerbated and not discussed at all. 
Because, some people were actually hiring contractors in India, to scam people. 

Jim Browning. People should look HIM up on YouTube. When they do, they should ask Jim Browning, how do 
those people get their leads...? Also, if someone in the United States keeps pissing them off, will they 
have someone like APT29 use a VISCIOUS cyberattack, or even have a group of PMC’s assassinate someone 
like me...?

Thing is, that’s what actually happened to me. They failed because I could see "clues" ahead of time, and 
they didn’t get it. I literally have videos that show pieces of evidence that support my theory. 
I fired Sarah Schellinger because she just chose to be a cunt instead of helping me. Her idea of helping 
me, was to throw me a brick while I’m in the middle of the ocean treading water, instead of a life preserver.

That’s not helpful at all, is it? Dennis Bruce sounded that fuckin’ stupid too, “Oh it’s just your opinion 
that your court appointed attorney isn’t being helpful”. Yeah, it was a lot more than that bro. Oh well.

As for Linus Tech Tips, they kept ejecting me from the forum with no fuckin’ thought put into it at all. 
I had an advanced persistent threat attack my work at 1602 Route 9, Clifton Park NY 12065 where I managed a 
store for over 3 fucking years, and I think the problem is a LOT worse than I originally anticipated. 
CVE-2019-8936, in addition to a DDOS, and a ransomware attack left on multiple machines...

Then, I was able to make a correlation to these (2) kids on May 26th, 2020, that my smartphone was hacked 
with Pegasus. So, that’s how I know the shit is more complicated than what Linus Sebastian does on YouTube.
Or what Paul Pelagalli handles in Family Court. 
I’m gonna say it right now, Linus hasn’t outright disrespected me. Not out loud, anyway.
Paul Pelagalli most definitely fuckin’ has, cause I could tell him ERIC CATRICALA tried to kill me, right?
He won’t care.

So, Linus had me ejected because... 
I read the privacy policy facetiously. 
The privacy policy, is pointless on basically every website. 
It’s as if President Bush, could lie to people about 9/11, and then never ever worry about people catching on.
Most people believed President Bush, but most people really are morons.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

I was trying to piss some people off for a very good reason, and it’s a tactic that I still perform without
hesitation. Because it gives me power over someone, and they don’t understand how it works. Just like how 
girls like to be told what to do...? Or, Sean Hannity will do what RUPERT MURDOCK tells him to do...?  
Effeminate people LOVE being issued commands. Even Mark Zuckerberg… perfect example of someone who enjoys
being told what to do… Man. There’s nothing he can do about it, either.

So, unless you’re a dude with testosterone and a brain, you can people to fuck off, like Julien Assange, 
or myself. It works, basically every time.

Someone comin’ at ya with a fuckin’ backpack that’s got a neon light in it...? 
“Fuck off bro. I’m all set.”
Then, that’s when they chased me for about 90 minutes with a dildo in their asshole that whole time…
Right before SCSO-2020-028501 @ 05/26/20 0130 near 1780 US-9, Clifton Park, NY 12065.

Take for instance, Amazon Web Services, Google, even Microsoft at one point... these companies have even
fallen victim to trying to tell ME what to do, but found out that I was ALL set… and that’s when I began 
to turn the screws.

Some people might not understand, these manipulative tactics work a little TOO well...
So, you might not realize when you’re stepping on your own teammates toes.

Still, people might not realize this, but when [people cooperate/communicate with me*]...? 
Then, I have NO REASON to be an arrogant dickhead, then I’m basically your pal.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Me   : Oh yeah, you’re gonna tell me to have a nice day...? 
       Well... 
       Guess you BETTER have a nice day, too...~!
Her  : Thanks~!
       I will~!
Me   : *spitefully* Good.
       You better have one of the BEST days of your life, today…
       …or else.
Her  : …really?
Me   : Yep.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

It’s like, imagine somebody like Terry Crews, he has that personality where if he says those words like he
used to do the Old Spice commercials, it’s gonna sound like a real spiteful “HAVE A NICE DAY”, but nah.

Guy probably means it, for sure. Sometimes people say things that sorta sound facetious, but they’re not
actually being facetious at all. So like, you might get slightly miffed by it too...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Me  : Hey, look lady.
      I told ya that you BETTER have a REAL nice day.
Her : Oh, you BETTER have a REAL nice day, too... dude.
Me  : I actually meant that though...
Her : So did I...
Me  : Then I guess that’s false facetiousness.
Her : Yeah. *softening up* Guess that IS what it means...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Not gonna use a tactic like ‘manipulation’, when someone is cooperating. 
But if a girl is talking back to me in a submissive way like above...? 
Not only do I know they’re telling me the truth... but apparently they are getting closer to me.
That means she probably wants to cob on my knob.

Look, not trying to make it about manhandling females all the time here.
I’m just saying, when people cooperate, what they say will sound PLAUSIBLE.
    
Microsoft actually decided to cooperate with me, because they cared about an actual certified professional 
that studied their curriculum, and they wanted to be more transparent. People want to protect their reputation 
and everything, but when someone starts making accusations, oh shit, quiet that dude down asap.

They can get away with that in a lot of cases, because people won’t be persistent if they’re just running 
their mouth and lying. However, someone that’s telling the truth is gonna keep repeating themselves, over 
and over again. Then eventually, the feedback loop becomes too loud to contain, and then just like Tesla, 
`$250B shows up out of thin air, and people will say to themselves "Holy fuck!"
    
Google/YouTube has spent the last 3 years having an EMPLOYEE downvote nearly ALL of my content... probably 
because they didn’t appreciate that video, where I told Linus Sebastian "You’re their bottom bitch." either. 
Worked a little too well, he didn’t want me to know he fuckin’ saw that video several times. Asus then 
proceeded to get themselves caught in a video where I can still file a lawsuit against them, for something 
that occurred in 2019, it’s called UEFI/BIOS persistent malware. You reinstall the operating system, and it 
still deploys the malware on the BIOS chip.

Sometimes an actual professional has to come along and show guys like Linus Sebastian "Here, let me show you 
how an actual expert would do that." Of course that’s gonna piss him off, cause that’s like one-upping this 
dude on his own content stream. Oh well. The new kids were using some real dirty tricks, but I have some dirty 
tricks too.

There are other ways to express themselves, where you can be like me, and perform a demonstration instead of 
having 20 people edit a video... and like, do it all by yourself. He COULD do that, but he doesn’t actually 
know how to. That’s because his editing team is actually pretty skilled.

YouTube, can skew its own metrics. So, don’t piss off a platform like YouTube, and they won’t make it 
impossible to get exposure, compensation, or viewers/subscribers. If you do, they will limit your exposure 
on their platform, almost like how the Patriot Act is used to put a piece of tape over JULIEN ASSANGE’s 
mouth, or Edward Snowden’s mouth... Meanwhile, that video "Collateral Murder" could be the reason why 
Edward Snowden released so many files from the National Security Agency.
    
Mark Zuckerberg can censor any individual on Facebook, then go before Congress (like he did in October 2019), 
and tell them "We don’t censor people", when that dude definitely lied. 

Just like he did with Cambridge Analytica.
That dude and his company LITERALLY had my account suspended because I thought that some dude on Facebook 
was a "bot", or "Russian". Facebook, probably doesn’t know this but, they’re the reason why the 16 election 
allowed Trump to win. Cause it was manipulated by Russians. So Operation Crossfire Hurricane happened, and 
Congress got involved, and there was a dick in a slew of people’s mouths that wasn’t supposed to be there.

I swear, I feel as if Facebook is causing America to become PRETTY COMMUNIST or FASCIST after all.
Not all around the board, but, it does feel like things are progressively worsening.

Then 6 months after (2) dudes tried to kill me using Pegasus deployed to my iPhone, the 
2020 US Federal Data Breach, AKA Solorigate. The Russians are smarter than Americans in many cases. 
Why...? Well, if it’s how some of these guys from SCSO think... 

It’s cause so many Americans are overconfident without even knowing what the fuck they’re talking about. 
Their "money muscles" allow them the excuse for Viagra or Cialis to fuck their wife.

It’s not a big deal if people need that, but... 
Russians, probably don’t need that at all, it’s why they basically fist fight polar bears.
Nothing like some polar bear showing up, and then it growls at ya, and you say “Shut the fuck up...”
...and then the polar bear fucks off. (← ANYBODY IS GONNA BE IMPRESSED BY THAT)

That’s how they will look for any little mistake that the Americans made, alongside the Chinese.
Then, when someone like myself tells:

...I was actually almost killed by some fuckfaces that attacked me at my job, and are so sophisticated...
...they’ve never been caught. Until they got caught by me, then they locked me out of my own device.
Now I know BRUCE TANSKI, ERIC CATRICALA, JAMES LEONARD, MICHAEL ZURLO, and JOHN HOFFMAN have some conspiracy
shit going on with Center for Security, among many other local businesses. I’m talkin’ getting a whole bunch 
of businesses and people in the local, county, and state agencies, to DO ILLEGAL SHIT WITH THEM

Such as: Fraud, more fraud, additional fraud, even more fraud than that, when they’re not committing fraud, 
home invasions, kidnappings, rapes, murders, breaking and entering without breaking and entering (lock 
picking), disabling security systems and alarms, safe cracking, stealing documents/wills/valuables, 
basically anything you can think of that would result in stealing EVERYTHING a person OWNS, in ANY bank 
account, ANY property, and if they wanna throw you into a concrete foundation...? 

Well, they can and they will. 
It probably sounds fucked up, but I’m sure they don’t even think twice about it.

Now for the 500th time, somebody’s gonna read that and say "I don’t think there was a dick in anybody’s mouth 
at all, dude..." You don’t know that. Might be a metaphor, but it might be a literal statement too. 

Nobody has a reputation more important than violating someone’s constitutional rights, specifically their 
freedom of expression, OR... selling people’s data.
    
And that was the key point that I was making in the video where I blasted Linus Sebastian.
Then these people have these "unspoken" conversations with me, that means, they’re directly interacting 
with me and hoping that I understand what they’re saying, because they made damn certain that it would be 
obvious enough for me to understand. 

But- they’re not going to risk being SEEN having that conversation at all.

The good reason I had where I just started openly blasting people that deserve to be disrespected...?
Well, it’s because the police need some fuckin’ help. To be fair, I don’t mean to be a total asshole to 
ALL of them, but they really need some help. 

People are doing a lot more than just committing identity theft, or cybercrime, but they’re also committing
fraud, home invasions, safe cracking, manslaughter or murder, and then selling a persons entire estate to
somebody with a huge wad of cash in their pocket or bank, all while they have a huge wad hanging off of 
their face. All the while, not getting arrested nor investigated. 

Not to the degree where it’s making a dent, anyway. 
Jim Browning, does not do more than the entire FBI or the NSA combined... 
But, he’s doin some real damage. Saying that (1) dude did more than everyone else combined...?

Me       : Yeah. I know. But, questions abound.

Sometimes I do ask myself ‘What the hell ARE these organizations doing? 
...other than eatin’ fuckin’ donuts and using the USA-PATRIOT Act...
...to funnel cash into certain people’s pockets...? 
I’m not trying to provide myself with false assurances, though I am positive that they’re doing plenty. 

Still, pretty pissed about Mr. Murphy. 
Maybe he could give me a badge already, so I can (find/catch) these fuckin’ douchebags. 
With a badge, I could catch these fucks that keep committing: 
______________________________________________________________________________________

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ 
Can’t actually do anything once I catch them, because, no badge. A badge really would be super useful.
As it stands, the BEST thing I can really do…? Is sending some mail to this address…

That way, nobody has to ask them to STOP anymore, cause I’d just catch them in the act. 
The epidemic may never truly be RESOLVED, but with the correct strategy, even Kerberos, the 3-headed dog,
the hound of Hades... the one that guards the gates to hell...?

Well, once someone who’s had an easy pay day, has their legs broken and nobody does anything to avenge them... 
...they’ll just understand how fuckin’ stupid it is to do that, and remember it every single time they walk.		
An ass whooping just isn’t enough. Legs being broken, it’s the perfect solution.
    
Once I realized that Microsoft was actually willing to help me... then, my tone shifted drastically.
That’s when I started telling everybody what I used to say, "The world’s best software engineering only happens 
in one place." 

Everyone knows the correct location where the worlds best software engineering takes place.

| Then one day, a guy by the name of Jeffrey Snover told red rover to move over... and now we have PowerShell 7 |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Jeff Snover, is a good guy, but I’m sure someone will say “Who the hell is red rover supposed to be…? Hm..?”
It’s just something that rhymes with Snover… that’s it. 

Red rover could be a metaphor for “the OLD way of doing things”…
…and once they realize that’s what I mean, some of them will say “Well, we do that basically every day…”

I don’t really know a whole lot about him, but I do know that he was pretty involved in the development of 
PowerShell… PowerShell, is what helped ME assemble the bits and pieces, and develop better logic.
But also, it was the reason why I began to integrate GRAPHIC DESIGN, with PROGRAMMING…

That’s how I know, if I apply how I would write some code that ACTUALLY WORKS, then I somehow have more 
sense than any police officer, judge, doctor, lawyer, etc. In fact, that (1) video above just goes to show 
that anyone who works at any computer shop in any country in the world, OR, any network engineer in the world…
…that I may match or exceed their experience or qualifications. Because it integrates a dozen different aspects
of programming, virtualization, networking, system administration, graphic design, and logic development…
…into a single package that not (1) single person assisted me in building. 

In other words, I made that, to impress the hell out of some people that engineer the world’s best software.

Some of them seem to think that you have to have a large stack of cash to be able to detect when people lie to you.

Uh-uh. No way. I can tell that shit from the sound of people’s voices. And, that’s one reason why apparently, 
it’s illegal to make an audio recording of a court proceeding. It sure as hell shouldn’t be, because then 
the sound of their voices can’t be HEARD, nor the “microexpressions” in their voice or on their faces when they 
lie in a courtroom. Weird.
    
Not sure if people get the feeling that I’ve been containing quite a lot of rage my entire life.
When I managed Computer Answers, nobody could keep up with me. 
They didn’t understand, that I will tear a human being apart when I’m ready to do that.
But sometimes I have to stop myself from thinking about being that intense.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Intensity",@"
At some point, I have to curtail what was said cause I know someone will intentionally misunderstand what 
I wrote. It’s like this... Innocent people that aren’t doing something stupid, they have no reason to be 
worried about me. The people that think they are fuckin’ dangerous, they probably know that I am on their 
level. So when some kid mows down a bunch of people in Buffalo... everyone is shocked and horrified by that... 
    
They don’t know WHY it happened, they just RESPOND to it AFTERWARD.
    
It’s not a PROACTIVE approach, that most people ever take.
It’s a REACTIVE approach.
    
And then AS I spend several days writing up this entire thing...? Uvalde Texas, 19 kids, 2 teachers, shot 
down by some kid. Some of these people in the FBI and the NSA, they actually like reading and seeing stories 
like this. Most of them don’t. Most of them will probably get extremely fucking offended that I would say 
something like that at all. What I said may true, there may be some sick fucks among you, that lie about it 
to their peers. I wouldn’t say it if I didn’t see it with my own eyes.

I’m not gonna take that comment back, either, because the problem is too severe for anyone to know with any
degree of certainty, if that is true or false. No one may EVER know that, but if I can draw up a parallel from 
SCSO to everywhere else, 

People think there’s no way to stop someone like that, and guys like Trooper Carter, they think shit like 
that. Someone is their own person, they’re gonna make their own choices... However, it helps when some guy 
looks at pictures of a couple people that attempted to murder me.

Cause now, I gotta deal with a long list of people that think I made that shit up, or think there’s no 
way I called 911 at all TWICE. Yeah, I recorded a video of these fuckin’ queers, and, tried to call 911 
TWICE, but both times I hit the send button, the timer would rise, and no sound came out of the device.	

Captain Jeff Brown, is a fucking moron and doesn’t understand what that means. MAYBE SOMEDAY, I’ll say sorry.
It wasn’t bad reception. It was two fuckfaces that were IN THE MIDDLE OF, attempting to corner me, to kill me.
Not me making up wild fuckin’ fantasies or stories, me, myself, directly linking CVE-2019-8936, on 01/15/19 
and then Pegasus on 05/26/20 at like, the same fuckin’ address I worked at for years.

I did say these things to some cunt named Sarah Schellinger. She ignored me.
    
Cool. Then, I think to myself, I really don’t want Trooper Carter to get shot by some psycho.
I had some clue that Russians were doin’ this shit to me, but nobody actually gave a fuck.
That would include my neighbors, my family, everyone I know, "Wow, dude’s out of his melon."
Except, 2020 US Federal Data Breach, AKA Solorigate.
Yeah. Now I have something to hold over everybody’s heads... 
    
Trooper Carter could not process anything about how the best people in the industry at the: 
- Department of Defense
- National Insecurity Agency
- Federal Bureau of Incompetence...
...they allowed the Russians complete access to everything they wanted, gave them a middle finger, and took off.
    
Trooper Carter couldn’t understand what I said back in December 2020.
It’s like, if you ask for help...? They will help you. 
They see you treading water in the ocean, and Trooper Carter will toss you a really heavy brick.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

...but nah. That’s not what I meant at all. 

He seems to think I am that type of person... who would go to Uvalde, Texas elementary school, and mow down 
a bunch of innocent kids. Or, shoot his ass. At no point did I say that I was going to shoot VLADIMIR PUTIN, 
OR the polar bears, OR Pavel Zaichenko... 

Nah, what I said was that I was gonna kick the shit out of them with my bare hands. 
Putin, Polar bears, Pavel. The 3 P’s. Trooper Carter didn’t understand that... 

I was like half his size, and could do the same thing to him... 
When I say I’m gonna do something, it’s just my bare hands.
I was pretty pissed off with this dude, but he’s not the only one.
Obviously I’ve gotten quite a name for myself.

        Says he’s gonna kick the shit outta some polar bears or somethin’...
911_1 : ...that’s animal abuse...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I don’t want people that are TWICE MY SIZE, to think I’m a fuckin’ loose cannon.
But they will STILL send like (6) guys whenever they hear about ME being involved in something...
    
If I lay down, disassociate from society like my uncle Thomas Cook kept telling me all about at Cook’s Deli...
...do nothing and let Trooper Carter handle it...

He might wind up getting shot to death by some fuckin’ lunatic. My dad got shot too.
Who gives a shit...? I do, believe it or not.
*pointing at chest* I could’ve done something about it LONG beforehand... 
But, somebody felt like it was best to slander me, or put me in a fuckin’ bubble, and totally ignore me.

Ted probably cries himself to sleep every night, and isn’t actually gay. 
But, so long as he allows Exxon Mobil to drill his asshole, he is *temporarily*.
After Exxon Mobil busts a massive nut...? Ted goes back to not being gay anymore.

Sean cries himself to sleep every night, too. Tears of joy, though. When he was younger he never 
thought he would water at the mouth, when thinking about sucking some dudes’ dick every day.
But, he does that to support his family.

If his kids ever find out...? They’re gonna probably change their names and fuckin’ take off.
Cause they found out their dad was a TOTAL cocksucker, not even a metaphorical one either.

He told himself that getting paychecks from one of the richest bastards on the planet, was worth the 
disgrace after all. He’ll talk to himself in the mirror too:

      Nuh-uh.

But even HE has a conversation with himself in the mirror too:

     Wish I could stop shittin’ in my pants every day...
     But, so what if I don’t?
     Every man shits their pants at some point...
     I just happen to be consistently above average, at everything I do.
     *points at self* I run General fuckin’ Motors pal...
     *I* could go into *any* research and development room, 
     ...draw a fuckin’ *line* ANYWHERE on the engineering blueprint...
     And my god...? 
     Our company will make a *lot* more money.
     Who cares if people complain...?
     Nobody.
     Everyone, gets a 100K mile warranty.
     If the fuckin’ engine or transmission have serious problems...? 
     Oh well. 
     We’ll "fix" it, alright...
     I’m Bob fuckin’ Lutz.
     And I’m gonna kick TUCKER CARLSON’s ass at golf, if it’s the last thing I do...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

The rest of his problems he can ignore.
If his office smells like shit, oh well, he’ll tell people his toilet isn’t working. 
What really bothers him the most, isn’t recalls or manufacturing defects... cause why?
That’d be less money for GM.
What bothers him the most is when a guy like TUCKER CARLSON talks shit about his golf game...
Now, Bob needs to do something about that.

        TC on the fuckin’ scene.
        Fox News wouldn’t be shit without me, and they know it.
        Fox and Friends...? 
        That’s not what people wanna see, and the ratings say it all.
        Best in the industry, folks.
        Cause they wait for ME to be on. And they know it, too.
        Old people flippin’ the channels...? 
        They put it on Fox News, and they see "ah it’s not Carlson"...?
        "gotta be something GOOD on somewhere..."
        When it’s me...? They all stop.
        It’s why I have the best ratings in the industry... just, make a god damn fool of myself.
        If I was gay, I could have RUPERT MURDOCK suck MY fuckin’ dick, and he would too.
        I dunno why Hannity does that to him. *shakes head* But, that’s fucked up.
        Wish I could get some girl to suck *MY* dick sometime...
        Yeah, it really is an embarrassment when I spend `$500 on a date...
        Then I whip my dick out, and... fuckin’ a dude.
        *EVERY SINGLE TIME*, that girl starts giggling.
        ...then they say "Aw~! It’s so cute!"
        How is a girl gonna be able to suck my dick, if she keeps LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY...?
        What the FUCK bro.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Look, I have no idea if Tucker really does have a 4-inch pecker.
I don’t really care either, to be fair.
Still, it would not be difficult for me to believe, if that is the case.
Other people probably agree.

Ultimately, I feel pretty bad for some of these people. 
What can they do about any of those things...?

Tim Cook probably talks to himself in the mirror too...
...probably sees a guy like Ted Cruz getting bent over by Exxon Mobil, and says...

     Doesn’t seem FAIR... 
     …guy isn’t even gay...
     What is he doin’ that for...?
     It’s not like he’s gonna earn himself an award for doin’ that...
     Nah, I know a straight dude who’s allowing himself to be pumped in the butt, when I see one.
     That’s what I’m lookin’ at right now.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

But Tim would get turned on watching Ted Cruz getting pounded in the butthole. 
Tim has the same fantasy that Ted does.
Tim wants the rose petals in the motel 6 room, bringin’ candles.
Some fuckin’ hummus and crackers to snack on...? 
Wants to be told by his man, how special he is... 
...and then load him up with a solid stream of jizzlings.

If that sounds gay...? 
Well, I don’t know if anybody KNEW this, but... 
Tim Cook is *very* gay. 
No question about that. 
Steve Jobs knew it.
Bill Gates knew it.
Steve Ballmer knew it...

              *eyebrows focus inward* ...he’s gay, isn’t he...?
Everyone    : Yep. 
              That’s… Tim Cook. 
              He’s such an outstanding citizen, that he gets an award for being the Gayest guy in Cupertino…
              …every year.
All of them : *eyebrows release* Wow.
              At least he seems proud to show it... 
              I mean, damn.
              Gayest guy in Cupertino, is nothin’ to sneeze at...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
    
Being the gayest guy in Cupertino is nothing to be ashamed of, for Tim...
...he’s probably the state of California’s list of top 10 gay guys.
So, it’s a badge of honor and pride, actually.

Ted Cruz, not even being gay... having the fantasy of being gay in the back of his mind...
...about taking it in the ass repeatedly... 
That’s fucked up, cause that doesn’t make a lot of sense unless you consider the stack of cash involved.
Otherwise, I don’t know why that dude does that to himself, getting himself confused.

Ted has to weigh his options every morning:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Ted : Hey, what should I be interested in having sex with, today... 
      vagina...? 
      Or, penis...?
      *puts his hand to his chin, in deep thought* Hm...
      I dunno man... 
      this is a tough one.
      *He gets a call from Exxon Mobil* 
      *he hangs up... 
      Penis it is.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I probably should stop saying this stuff about Ted Cruz. 
Because frankly, I’m fairly certain that he is NOT gay at all.
But- he DOES like CASH.
Mountains of it.
Just, forgets all of the things he does to have so much, and the dude just strips down naked, and then...
...rolls around in his mountain of cash.
So really, I guess Ted fuckin’ wins on all fronts, doesn’t he...?
I mean, who’s gonna see him naked, rolling around in his mountain of cash, and say:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Person : Dude, you’re fuckin weird, rollin’ around in a mountain of cash, naked...?
         *scoffs* What the hell is your problem...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Yeah, Dan Pickett has some friends that can do what I feared the most.

High standards, he’ll invite EVERY employee to Saratoga Golf Course for Christmas parties.
He will literally tell the owner of the best steak restaurant in the Capital District:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Dan  : *pointing* Listen ya awesome son of a bitch...
Chef : …?
Dan  : You’re gonna cater for the Christmas party, or else...
Chef : Fine...?
Dan  : I mean, c’mon dude, can’t put up a little fight...? 
Chef : Dan, *slight head nod* how long have we known each other...?
Dan  : Buddy, a real long time.
Chef : That’s right. 
       If my buddy Dan Pickett wants the best fuckin’ chef in the capital district...
       ...who JUST SO HAPPENS TO ALSO make the best god damn steak in the capital district...
       ...to cater his Christmas party...
       ...with the most delicious fuckin’ steak anyone in this capital district even makes...
       ...then, if I’m not at the fuckin’ party...
       ...who the hell am I...?
Dan  : I’m impressed.
       Highly.
Chef : Yeah, well, I’ve got a new recipe that’s gonna blow your socks right off, dude.
Dan  : You did not just say that to me...
       NOW I wanna try it.
Chef : Nah man, it’s gonna be your Christmas present. 
       Just gotta wait.

(^ High standards)

Does he have a dick so small that girls can’t even blow him, cause they’re laughing uncontrollably? 
No way. He’s married and has kids. So...
Carlson has a few kids too... probably artificially inseminated, though.
    
Anyway, look. Am I being overly obnoxious about all of these guys...? No way chum.
But, for Dan...? I thought he was doing some shit to get me killed...
Turns out that some fuckface named ERIC CATRICALA had a lot to do with that.

I don’t remember the fuckin’ recording I made, I tend to forget them after a while.
But I know someone got a hold of that recording, and I was right about what I said, and I know it.
That’s why I left that fuckin’ thumb drive and letter back on 02/26/20. Maybe it was the 27th.

Still, nah, despite all the things I said, it’s pretty apparent that I had DAN PICKETT, pegged incorrectly.

What that is, is a direct link between Jesse Pickett, and my deceased father.
Even sending a copy of this to Oliver Robinson yielded no additional change in status, or care...
...at least it seems that way. So there’s some sort of association here that isn’t be verbally addressed.
I think somebody owes me an explanation.
_______________________________________________________________________________
| Jumping out of the Dan Pickett narrative, into the BIGGER PICTURE narrative |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I WAS convinced, that Mr. Pickett got my audio recording back around 01/11/19...
...when I was talkin’ to Matt Roerig, and I told him about the recording, I can’t remember whether I ever 
sent the fuckin’ thing or not...
But I know that CVE-2019-8936 had something to do with it.

Now I know that even if he was...? 
The police won’t actually do anything about it, except ignore it.
For VERY different reasons than it seems.

Paul Zurlo did this TWICE in July 2020.
Paul Zurlo, is MICHAEL ZURLO’s son.
Shelley Zeitske ALSO ignored this, when I printed a bunch of pictures, a storyboard...
...and brought them all to the SCSO Administrative office.
    
So, if someone attacks someone elses’ business with technology based attacks like "cyberattacks", oh well.
They might actually tell you to fuck off, cause they don’t give a shit.
So, nobody exists who can do anything about it...
They will say "it was your own damn fault", or "Maybe you were doing something you shouldn’t have been doing".

So, to be perfectly clear here, even if you spend `$250K on EQUIPMENT, it can still be subjected to a 
cyberattack that can cripple any business. 
    
So, when people say "it was your own damn fault". Nah, it probably wasn’t at all. It was probably a surgically
precise operation where someone with a lot of patience and experience, took out that company like a game of
10 dimensional chess.

It’s like, if I recorded something on my smartphone, and someone heard what I recorded even though I never 
sent it to anybody...? That means about 10 fuckin’ things are VERY REAL. 
I can’t really get mad at a SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL.

But- it means that MASS SURVEILLANCE has INVADED EVERYONES PRIVACY.
It means the device doesn’t actually need to have a paid service plan in order for it to be remotely accessed.
It means that everyone’s idea of privacy is long fuckin’ gone.
It means that A lot of people just blatantly lie, so no one really knows what the fuck is going on.
The people that DO know what’s goin’ on have a lot to hide.
Then there are certain ENFORCERS that FRAME and MANUFACTURE evidence, to get people in trouble, because...
...well, America is like a PRISON.

So indicating the TRUTH, will get people in trouble.
And the truth is, America is pretty strong on camera, to everyone else in the world.
We’re incredibly fragile, and we lie to each other to keep the system going.
The truth is, at any moment, it could all collapse... because of our enemies in BRITAIN, and RUSSIA.

When my smartphone has the fuckin’ radios disengaged, but... a message STILL comes through on Signal...? 
Not only is that fucking alarming, but it caused me to think that I needed to keep my eyes peeled in every 
fucking direction. Some dude that’s trying to hurt me isn’t gonna leave “clues”. But, someone who’s trying 
to KILL me, they may actually go so far as to sell me a wireless access point, as a trojan horse.

I don’t think the conversation is ever going to get away from that subject where somebody did try to kill me,
multiple times... and now I have to catch all of you fucks in the act. 
Which, believe me, it’ll be a lot easier than people think.

Fake cop cars have a lot to do with endpoint encryption errors that throw a GUID right around the time of 
the FNFG → KeyCorp merger in 2016. So when all of the computers needed to be rebooted, a transaction had
already transpired. 

If I tell Dan Pickett, "Hey, sorry for blowing up your spot a lot of times, but someone tried to kill me, 
and I thought YOU were involved..." 
I don’t think he was anymore, haven’t for a while.
Dan is not gonna respond via words. 

Because a guy like him knows that I’m right about this shit, someone CAN use Pegasus/Phantom...
...to try and kill me with a squad of private military contractors...
...and if they fail? 
Ask SCSO to cover it up, and then, that’s exactly what they do.
____________________________________
| As for the GAG ORDER narrative…? |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Females, and gay guys like Tim Cook, they really love gag orders.
But, companies and stuff...?
They DON’T really like those.

In relation to Tim Cook, whether it’s with his boyfriend, or if it’s allowing someone remote access to 
my device like back in May 2020...? Tim fuckin’ loves gaggin’ on somethin, doesn’t he...? 
I’m not excluding really anybody, what I am doing...
...is writing all these things down because my father rarely ever did that.

Most people think that people in the distant future are going to give a flying fuck about the selfies people 
took, or how cool somebody was at a dinner party. Nah, they’re not gonna give a shit about how you looked at 
all. Or how cool you were to people currently alive. They’re gonna read stories like this, and realize how 
fucked up society currently is.

The answer is, if somebody has done something worthy of being remembered, or written about, it won’t be 
because they did something that anybody could do. It’ll probably be because somebody who had the world at 
their fingertips, chose to have some restraint, to make it fair for others. 
That’ll be the thing people remember.
    
It’s not society’s fault that it teaches people to be indifferent, and to care less.
Society is incredibly cold and calloused to one another, and I believe it has a lot to do with the idea
of a PERMANENT RECORD. Records aren’t supposed to be PERMANENT unless somebody or something has died.
But, the OPPRESSORS use this legal system to allow OIL COMPANIES to do whatever the hell they want.
They’ve caused society to break down into chaos.
It’s society’s fault for not seeing the error of its’ own ways, but I like to compare the idea of...

Society, being like the 6 trillion+ cells in a human body, one individual cell can’t necessarily talk
to another specific cell, can they...? Perhaps if they’re close enough.
Usually the body speaks to itself because it is comprised of multiple components.
So, if the multiple components are acting indifferently, than society will ALSO be indifferent.
If the individual is taught better morals, and upholds those morals, then society will inevitably heal itself.
However, that is impossible to do if so many people have had BRAIN DAMAGE from LEAD POISONING.

I think that is what is going on.
I think that humanity, has POISONED itself, and the earth is slowly becoming the “Garden of Earthly Delights”.
It’s the MASTERS faults, they lost control and they don’t care to admit that. 

People in the future are gonna read about somebody who finally took offense to the story I was telling, 
and then a bunch of people had a new American civil war.
One that forced a lot of people into a grave site.

It’s actually unavoidable, because organizations like Fox News exist, pumping propaganda that is literally 
lying to people’s faces...
...American society fails to draw the conclusions I’ve made, because...
...I see the biggest picture there is, in reference to humanity.
I see exactly where everything ends.

Extinction level event, it may be impossible to stop now.
Unless of course, SpaceX manages to save the world...
Then, most of the planet will just be cooked alive...
Some people will survive...
But most of them will die.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
If in 20 years, we’re all still around, we could look back and remember things like 2016 Before the Flood, 
or like, this document talking about how the last 8 of 10 years were the hottest years on record.
THEN, THEY’LL look back and see "Damn, this dude was really onto something, huh...?"
They’ll see that 28 of the last 30 years were the hottest years on record.

Sean Hannity will STILL be saying, "climate change isn’t real". 
But, that’s because... people who watch him, are morons.
People seem to think your likability, or amount of money you have, means you’re a productive member of society.

That’s how stupid they are. 
If they have a house, car, wife, or kids... to show for all their hard work...?

Most people think that means they’re important. 
Sure it does. Keep tellin’ yourself that.

Most of those people don’t realize that most people that get married, they get divorced.
Most of those people don’t realize that even guys like Elon Musk or Bill Gates...
...they feel quite empty and listless at times.

Why...? 
Because money doesn’t resolve how they feel. 
They may crush it at this or that, but nobody is ever truly content.

Ultimately, here’s what separates morons from intelligent people…
_______________________________________________________________________________
| Benjamin Franklin – It is the duty of every citizen, to question authority. |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The truth is, I could write these documents for the rest of my life.
THAT IS something to show for my hard work, but most people won’t care… because reading is really difficult.
Unless they’re reading something COOL, or INTERESTING… then it’s actually REALLY EASY.

Cause they have heard everybody elses’ story, and thought that my story was too complicated or doubtful... 
That’s because society shapes people’s expectations.

The more you interact with OTHER people, the more you judge people based on their APPEARANCE, not by PRINCIPLE.
So, as long as someone APPEARS to be clean-shaven, dressed well, etc. so forth…?
Then people will IMMEDIATELY assume that person is about as RELIABLE AS THEY COME…
…at telling the TRUTH, the WHOLE TRUTH, and NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH…
…and THAT is the moment where they will lie when and where it works out the best.

And this entire process is basically FOOLPROOF, too.

So, someone you knew for a very long time may have been a genius that entire time, but...
...nobody ever knew because they didn’t actually invest enough time developing their own ideas or perspective.
    
In reality, a lot of people have the same things everyone else does... opinions shared, perspectives shaped, 
cars, homes, wives, kids... very few of them ever dare to be unique enough, like me.
    
Had my father written MORE of his thoughts down, I probably would’ve understood him a LOT better.

All of THESE VIDEOS, were RECORDED, in the month of FEBRUARY 2022, like DAYS BEFORE this INCIDENT above.

I told these dudes on March 1st, 2022, that [I was targeted by the Russians*]. 
They flat out said "(Fuck you, dude…*) I don’t think the Russians are attacking you." (* They didn’t say that)
They had no information to come to that conclusion. 
The police do this, they don’t realize how moronic they sound when they do this... but, they do it anyway.
    
My problem is, why would I go around believing that...? How do they know...? 
I’m asking these questions facetiously, because they were talking out of their ass.
The truth is, the Russians were attacking me, but- EVEN IF THEY WERENT ATTACKING ME...
...these police officers did "0" things, to conclude that I was wrong.

Normally, a police officer is supposed to look for marks on a person that’s been assaulted, if they see marks, 
then they can conclude that they were just attacked. That doesn’t apply to cyberattacks at all, so you have to 
accuse them of having some jizz-on-the-chin.
    
They were judging things based on how they appear. So, Dwayne appears to be an actual professional, running a
computer shop, lying to people. Nobody did anything about the ransomware attack back in January 2019. Then, 
nobody did anything about the fuckin’ cable modem DDOS. Or, my USB-Lan Turtle getting "unplugged"... it was 
still plugged in, someone was using SOFTWARE to disconnect it. The police are just too stupid to ask about 
stuff like that, nor care about what it means.
    
I don’t think these cops knew that I had a video where Facebook and YouTube were downsampling a video that I 
uploaded at 1080p resolution. I did specifically state that... but like I said... they’re fuckin’ stupid.
    
I also have a 2hr~ video of myself uploading "A matter of National Security", 
That video took 2hr~ to process the HD content, of a 10m video.
Amazingly I recorded a different video of this because I knew it had gotten flagged at Google/YouTube.
While it was processing, I recorded a NEW video, spent 20m playing Counter-Strike: Source, and kicked 
everybody’s asses.

Then, I ended that recording, and saved the file. 
Then, I uploaded that NEW file.
Then, I watched that entire 20m video WHILE it was uploading. 
Then, once it was UPLOADED, AND FULLY PROCESSED, I watched that entire 20m video again on YouTube.
When I was done watching THAT video (2x the length as the original video, "A Matter of National Security"),
it was still processing the HD content of the first video.

I’m gonna keep that particular video UNLISTED, but yeah it’s basically a video getting FLAGGED for 
referencing PEGASUS/PHANTOM, JULIEN ASSANGE, COLLATERAL MURDER, and the WORD DOCUMENT LINE EXPLOIT.

Now, to a moron like the 3 of the (4) guys I just rattled off from Saratoga County Sheriffs Office...?
They’re not gonna be bright enough to know what the fuck that means.

Nah. It’s cause Google flagged that video, or someone in between did. Why did it get flagged...?
The document ITSELF, was discussing JULIEN ASSANGE, "Collateral Murder"...
...and a thing called "PEGASUS/PHANTOM"- it’s an (unresolvable/constant) threat to national security.

Because I wrote a document that a little green man was altering using an EXPLOIT that they’ve been using 
over the last (3) years whenever I edit documents. It’s cause the people that have been keeping tabs on me,
they have these various glitches that normal people who get paid a lot of money (like Eric Schnackenberg) 
...they would never detect this exploit, because they aren’t smart enough to detect it.

They might say something like “OoOoOhHh, so you’re wicked special huh?”
Nah, I’m saying that if I show the video to 5,000 people, 4,998 of them will NOT notice the exploit.
That is probably because most people will watch the video on their SMARTPHONE, and they won’t bother to
set the resolution to 1080P.
Because if GOOGLE keeps knocking the resolution DOWN on all of my VIDEOS, then people won’t notice the 
exploit, and then people will just think “WOW, THAT DUDE IS OUT OF HIS MIND~!”

When the reality is, GOOGLE has been doing this shit to me.

It MAY be higher than that... perhaps SOME people will see the content in HIGH DEFINITION, but I really 
fuckin’ doubt a lot of people are doing that, because of this one reason alone: NOBODY SAYS ANYTHING.

Not one person says to me “Holy shit bro~! This shit’s been goin’ on, for like 3.5 years...?” Nope. 
Not a soul.
Now, why is that...? Is it because:
1) they didn’t notice it, 
2) they noticed it and realized how strange it looks, or 
3) they’re involved.
The rest of them will think I’m only talking about Pegasus, and maybe 100 of them will have heard about 
Pegasus. I’m probably not throwing very accurate numbers out there... but- even still, 
those are pretty good odds, huh?

Michael C. Cook, somehow recorded hundreds of incidents where someone was breaking the law, repeatedly, 
and then nobody actually gave a shit or cared... and then the entire planet experienced an EXTINCTION LEVEL
EVENT. The end.

I really have to start planning for this contingency. Because, there’s a chance that this BOOK, might save 
people’s LIVES and the rest of the planet. Now, I don’t know that, but I have to ASSUME that it’s UNAVOIDABLE.
Why...? Because that’s just how Satan has always gotten down. For every iteration of this planet with us 
humans on it, we perform the same exact role as the fruit fly experiment. Basically, the fruit flies in a 
petrie dish their population explodes and then eventually they run out of resources. 
Then, massive die off, and they all die.

Now just think, the OIL COMPANIES, are going to CAUSE THAT SAME THING, to HAPPEN.
And it could be resultant to Google just lowering the resolution of all my content... 
...so then nobody even sees the MANY WARNINGS... 
...because everyone that SAW the video...? 
They saw it in like 360P instead of 1080P, cause GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK WERE BEING DICKS LIKE THAT.

The viewers will mostly be like:
“WOW, DUDE RECORDED A MAD BLURRY VIDEO, WHAT A DUMBASS.” (← LITERALLY WHAT GOOGLE DOES)

Even if I were to show him the video, they are either NOT smart enough to see the OBVIOUS EXPLOIT I recorded on
video, or they’re PRETENDING to not see the OBVIOUS EXPLOIT. So, he’s going to ASSUME I’m being silly 
every time I try to talk to him about this shit.

Nah the problem is that you have to convince people that MAY be, being moronic, to STOP being moronic for a 
few minutes, because if they ACTUALLY hold off for THAT LONG...? There’s a fuckin’ chance that the human race 
will actually survive. Seriously. It’s... life or death buddy... (2) short minutes... NOW they’re thinkin’:

Them : *thinking* This dude is yankin’ my fuckin’ chain right now, isn’t he...? 
       I mean, he’s only askin’ for (2) minutes... 
       ...that’s basically like (4) Superbowl commercials worth of time, right there.
       Maybe it’ll be the best (2) minutes that anyone ever saw anything (happen/go down).
       *speaking*
Them : Alright chum, *crosses arms* you’ve got (2) minutes.
Me   : Gonna need a fair amount more time than (2) minutes...
Them : Dude.
       Seriously...?
       You convinced me that the fate of the human race was in MY hands, and you’re like...
       ...not even really prepared...?
       Dude.
       You’re a real jerk, man...
Me   : Oh well.
       I can educate you on a way to do something MORE with your existence, man. 
       I mean, don’t you ever ask yourself: Ya know, I COULD stand to eat quite a fewer number of donuts... 
                                            Why don’t I just pay attention to this dude...?
Them : What the hell man, I like donuts... 
       Stop fuckin’ sayin’ that...
Me   : I like donuts too, actually.
Them : Yeah right man.
       *head nod* What kinda donuts you like...?
Me   : Boston Cream Donuts.
Them : Get the fuck outta here...
       Those are MY FAVORITE kind.
Me   : Yeah man, mine too.
Them : Bro... 
       you can’t be THAT bad if you like Boston Cream Donuts...
Me   : I know, it’s basically like I’m trying to manipulate myself...
Them : Oh, so YOU’RE the REAL donut eater huh?
Me   : Basically.
Them : You know that’s... 
       ...actually a really powerful tool...
       ...cause I fuckin’ could’ve sworn...
       “Oh, who’s this guy...?”
       “Thinks he’s gonna get under my skin cause I like donuts...?”
       “Fuck outta here, bro...” 
       But nah. 
       You were sayin’ that cause you ALSO eat donuts.
Me   : Yeah.
       Boston Cream Donuts are my jam.
Them : Alright so what’s this fate of the human race shit you were sayin’...?

I wouldn’t say they’re morons, if they weren’t. 
However, someone’s gonna have a hard time digesting the fact that there are plenty of them on their team.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Hiding Guilt (1)",@"
When I record footage of something like that, and try to show it to them...? 
...it’s like I’m trying to force my dog to look at a pile of shit he just left on the floor...
...cause he couldn’t hold it, like Bob Lutz, former director of GM who shit his pants everyday for 50 years.

That’s how Eric Schnackenberg, and the police act, the DOG not Bob Lutz. Jesus.
I wouldn’t call a police officer or investigator anything THAT bad... holy hell.
Nah, the dog knows he pooped in the house... he’s not gonna wanna look at it...

But- that audio recording does a lot to reveal how I’ll have a perfectly normal conversation with some of em.
Quite a normal conversation, but it slowly builds up with details where I’m probably overwhelming all these guys.
They hear stuff I used to do working for a business like Computer Answers...?
Talking about IDENTITY THEFT, and CYBERCRIME...? 
RUSSIANS COMMITTING ESPIONAGE...?
Then, talking about a program that could be on ANYBODY’S SMARTPHONE and nobody would be able to tell them that 
it’s NOT on that device...

Then, it just goes sideways because they’re taking things out of context.
That’s a DANGEROUS tool actually.
It’s one thing when it’s a WRITTEN DOCUMENT and the DIFFERENCE can be seen clearly like night and day.

It’s a DIFFERENT thing, when it’s a COUNTY SHERIFF named MICHAEL ZURLO who apparently has it in for me...
I have a theory on why that is the case, below.

Each report, I go from being calm and collected → IMMEDIATELY PISSED OFF.
That’s why it’s IMPORTANT to RECORD these interactions, because they’re MANIPULATING ME in the same exact manner.

They may not understand HOW they did such a thing, OR... they know damn well what they said or did. 
Either way, they’re AWESOME at convincing anybody who’s less (intelligent/observant) than I am. 

Some people might not understand the CRIME that those (3) sheriffs committed in that audio recording.
I stated “I have no intention of hurting myself or anybody else.” 

And then professed my TRAIN OF THOUGHT or LOGIC, and then they decided to TAKE SOMETHING I SAID HYPOTHETICALLY 
OUT OF CONTEXT, and then TOOK ACTION and then INSERTED COMMENTS I NEVER MADE... into the record at the HOSPITAL, 
and whatever I filed a FOIL request for... that I didn’t get.

I have to assume that these guys at SCSO, when they hear certain words...?
Those words immediately cause them to feel, clueless.
If THESE guys feel CLUELESS, they’ll IMMEDIATELY SAY “That PEGASUS/PHANTOM shit is bogus buddy, lemme tell ya...”

Like a dog just shit on the carpet, and they don’t wanna look at that shit.
Same goes for Dwayne or Pavel. 
Guys that probably know about what I’ve been dealing with, might be Mr. Pickett.
What I’m dealing with, might be a KGB/MI5 operative sent over 35 years ago from Britain, or Russia.

Then you have a recipe for disaster where MICHAEL ZURLO could be the Russian Intelligence Officer, and nobody

Maybe MICHAEL ZURLO is an MI5 agent. Maybe he’s not even a real guy.
He’s a real guy alright, but what I mean is, he may not even necessarily be a person that was BORN with the name
MICHAEL ZURLO. 
Nah.
Dude was just sent over on a fuckin’ mission, KGB/MI5: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Superior  : Alright <unnamed> 
            We are sending your ass to the United States, sending you to a place called “Mechanicville”.
            When you get there...? 
            Find someone, anybody. 
            Kill somebody...? 
            Then, steal their actual identity.
            Don’t fuck this up, cause you’re not allowed back, fuckface.
<unnamed> : Alright, with pleasure.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Now this <unnamed> soldier being sent over to take somebody out in Mechanicville...?
He’s goin’ on a god damn, evil-ass mission...
*shakes head* This dude, probably doesn’t even have a mom. Or a dad.
Cause they mysteriously got into a “car accident” when he was a “little kid”.
Ya know...?
Ah, guy had the ol’ parents-got-into-a-car-accident-when-he-was-a-little-kid gag.
Maybe the person he says is his REAL MOM, is actually some ADDITIONAL agent that he somehow worked with in 
order to build up a WALL OF TRUSTWORTHY CHARACTERS, to topple American democracy from within. 
Works every fuckin’ time too, cause the police never collect leads. 
Maybe they do though. Look, the whole Zurlo family, they got in, they established a beachhead, they said:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

<unnamed> : Alright, I took over this son of a bitches life...? 
            We’re fuckin’ golden.
            Dude had a real nice house, a garage with an old 71 Corvette, awesome as fuck.
            I was able to steal his birth certificate and the deed to his house... 
            Nobody even cares that he’s gone now.
            We can start sending over the real soldiers now, boss.
Superior  : Excellent.
            Now, we’re REALLY gonna fuck with these Americans...
            I want you to go to the place that makes the cop cars, and then... have them make additional cop cars.
<unnamed> : *chuckles* Heh. I’m not even sure why that sounds funny yet, but- what for...?
Superior  : Oh, well, you gotta just start committing all kinds of fraud and just send us as much money as you 
            possibly can. Ya know...?
<unnamed> : With a fake-ass cop car...?
Superior  : Well, the people that made the REAL cop cars, they can “print off” an extra copy.
            Nobody will EVER NOTICE a FAKE COP CAR.
<unnamed> : This sounds like such a fuckin’ stupid plan, that it will definitely work. 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
            
These "little green men" aren’t little green men at all.
They’re people who can abuse these things exploits they have control over, but these exploits can be used 
by a FRIENDLY, or a FOE. Sometimes even BOTH, at the SAME time.
One minute, it’s a security guard that works for KeyCorp.
The next minute, it’s a rogue KGB agent who’s been stealing money from KeyCorp for *checks watch*
...35 fuckin’ years, never been caught.
Same thing over at the FBI. One minute...? Directory of 200 McCarty Ave.
The next minute...? MI5 agent. Together. They joined up behind everybody’s backs... stealing cash.
Now, we’re REAL fucked, dude.

If someone is HELPING me out...? 
Someone ELSE could be scheming to kill me...
And that’s what I believe a man driving a blue truck was doing, between January 28th, 2020 and May 22nd 2020. 
___________________________________________________
| Q : Why would anyone want to stalk/kill you...? |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I’m not really sure, other than I think it MIGHT have something to do with my FATHER... 
...which is why I suggest the document regarding JESSE PICKETT [might be important*].

It could ALSO be, that SOMEONE (with a wicked small dick) doesn’t like how often I talk about Edward Snowden, 
or JULIEN ASSANGE. If I was a corrupt politician, I would ALSO get pissed if someone kept using their 
constitutional right, to express themselves... because it would just keep pestering me and causing me to feel 
like I SHOULD abuse state resources, just like Andrew Cuomo did while he was governor.

I think that’s the most compelling reason, actually... that I kept talking about Edward Snowden/JULIEN ASSANGE, 
as well as HILLARY CLINTON, James Comey, and Andrew Cuomo. I was ALSO talking mad shit about VLADIMIR PUTIN. 
But, VLAD doesn't publicly speak English, so it gives people the impression that he doesn't know how to READ IT,
or ya know, basically understand a fuckin” thing Americans are sayin' about him.

It makes sense to me that Andrew Cuomo doesn’t like EITHER nickname that I came up with for him:
       _____________________________________________
Andrew | Don’t touch me, grandpa | Sausage Wrecker | Cuomo. Then again, maybe he likes em both, who knows...?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
But HILLARY CLINTON may have had direct involvement, if I’ll be perfectly honest.
Not gonna even explain how or why, but it would have something to do with Monica and a LOT more than that.
I’m still gonna give her a benefit of the doubt, because of BARACK OBAMA, and the fact that I think she did a great
job when she was in the white house with Bill. AKA, Bill actually a pretty good president till Whitewater.
I still don’t think it’s fair that Assange is in prison and she isn’t. She should consider getting him out,
if she wanted me to look past the whole “James Comey let me off the hook, and I snubbed Bernie Sanders” situation.

I think it may even have to do with Zontell Gordon murdering my father, and my aunt Terri Cook. Terri, 
picked me up from my aunts Debbie’s house back in October 1995, when our whole family was there on Lasher Road. 
She picked me up, and I stayed at her house for several days, playing Doom on their computer.

Weird thing is, I literally walked to her OLD house earlier that day, ya know...? 
You’d have to be a TOTAL MORON, to NOT CONSIDER, that I probably WENT TO MY COUSINS HOUSE FOR A PARTICULAR REASON 
12 EARLIER THAT DAY... and then, SHOCKINGLY... later that night...? 

Ohhhhhhhh, someone thought it’d be mad cool to try and kill me, almost like some faggots were involved in that...
Just like they had my dad killed.
(^ Seems the most compelling., but TO WHAT END...? ← That's what INVESTIGATORS are supposed to FIGURE OUT)

Still, something feels like pieces are missing. Such as TANSKI and HOFFMAN.
I saw Hoffman BEFORE I walked to Terri’s house in Innisbrook. He LITERALLY stated to me, a process where
his SECURITY TEAM will arrive BEFORE the POLICE do, if someone manages to get into their account.
Basically the man admitted that his SECURITY TEAM is a ring of FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES.

Considering that BRUCE TANSKI committed some shady shit that sounds EXACTLY like what JOHN described, I 
believe that he could ALSO have been very involved... Really, the reason being that all of these
people seem to have a relevance to the AREA, and A LOT OF MONEY. AND, a history for doin’ some shit.
I truly don’t think BRUCE TANSKI is actually bending JOHN HOFFMAN, MICHAEL ZURLO, or JAMES LEONARD over,
and pumping these guys in the butthole... 

I really don’t think BRUCE does that, he's too much of a stand-up dude, and owns Fairways of Halfmoon, and the 
Tanski Corporation, AND THAT AUTOMATICALLY MEANS, the man is FAR too important, and well respected, to EVER be even
REMOTELY ASSOCIATED, to CRIME. Nah. This dude wouldn't even ALLOW HIMSELF to be in the same ROOM as a criminal.
No fuckin' way, dude. WAY too cool... All the time. No fuckin' way this dude would ever do something SHADY/ILLEGAL.

You see, that above description about BRUCE TANSKI is meant to be REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY... However, there are fucking 
morons that live in CLIFTON PARK that think all of that shit is 100% spot on. That's because they're STUPID, though.
Because, yeah. There is a way he’s doin’ somethin SHADY/ILLEGAL to people FINANCIALLY at the BANK, like PAUL AMATO,
or even NIKOLA DINOVA... among hundreds to thousands of other people. 

I believe that CENTER FOR SECURITY has a way to get someone PHYSICAL ACCESS to the BANK AFTER HOURS. 
Ya know, imagine that...? Is that how NICHOLAS DINOVA and PAUL AMATO managed to get in such DEEP SHIT...? 

Yeah. 
It is. 
You would have to be as fucking stupid as TROOPER RUFFAS or MESSINES, or BOSCO, to not understand what I'm saying.
Because they are on the ILLEGAL CRIME MAFIOSO PAYROLL. SO IS MICHAEL FUCKING ZURLO.

Fake cop car 8 minutes after I passed the bank, 6/16/20 ~ 2200 SCSO vehicle, 4184 SEDAN.
I know that is what I saw, and this incident was RIGHT DOWN THE STREET from MR. TANSKI's office at 1-2 Cemetery Rd.
Not to mention, right down the street from his RESIDENCE on MEYER ROAD. COOL. So, I know exactly who this dude is.
Not to mention, the woman who owns WITS END is CHUCK HOFFMAN'S SISTER (Guy who owns OAK BROOK COMMONS, ACROSS FROM
TANSKI'S RESIDENCE on US-9), and SHE told me that SHE HAS NEVER HEARD OF JOHN HOFFMAN. 

Which, surprisingly, there could be a REALLY SINISTER FUCKING REASON FOR THAT HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT...
The sinister reason could be, because the police in CLIFTON PARK, have some MORONS working for them.

Not to mention, I kept seeing a couple of NYSP cruisers driving into Zappone in PAIRS like all summer long, 
I think they were doin’ something, shady. Zappone is literally adjacent to BRUCE TANSKI’s “property/home area”.
It’s across the street from 1783 Route 9.

MAYBE, it’s ALL of those theories, COMBINED that makes me such a [THREAT*].

I believe that my aunt Terri had some ulterior motive for doing that, based on some of the things my father 
stated in the weeks leading up to his execution. I call it an "execution" because I truly believe, from the 
BOX of stuff that my father managed to leave behind...? It makes a lot more sense, that he was onto something 
truly fucked up after all.

I tried to show some of this box of stuff to (2) sheriffs (Paul Zurlo, Anthony Agresta), and 2-3x NYSP troopers, 
on July 14th, 2020. The (1) dude told me to: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Cop1 : Hey, you... with the face.
Me   : Sup...? 
Cop1 : Fuck along now fuckface, none of us give a shit. 
       That’s a federal case you have there.
Me   : Whoa, buddy... easy. 
       You wanna hold off on the fuckin’ boston cream donuts...
       ...and connect me to a federal agent...?
Cop1 : C’mon man... 
       I wouldn’t even know where to BEGIN, in contacting the FBI for a FEDERAL CASE you have there...
Me   : Oh, nah...?
Cop1 : Nah, man. Look, if you need a hand...?
       You could TOTALLY call em yourself, ya know...?
Me   : Nah, yeah. I totally could call them myself, couldn’t I?
Cop1 : Yep. You sure could.
       Besides...
       *pats belly* ...I’m the donut eating champion.
Me   : Oh...
       Well, I’m fuckin’ absolutely amazed bro...
       That tall State Trooper standing in the doorway...?
       What’s HIS NAME, and what’S YOUR name...?
Cop1 : One of us is 2G62, another one is 2G36, and another one is 2G32.
Me   : Well, which one are YOU...?
       By the way, Paul Zurlo and another officer listed as a NYSP Trooper, is DRESSED AS AN SCSO OFFICER. 
       Either that or we have an unidentified police officer in SCSO CLOTHES... 
       …who was ALONGSIDE PAUL ZURLO on at least 2x occasions. 
       I think he’s like MILITARY actually.
Cop1 : Look, you only see 2x NYSP Troopers right now in your kitchen, right...?
Me   : Right. Tall guy, looks like he’s Dwayne Coonradt’s friend. 
       YOU, you’re the short guy that I’m gonna see again on 08/05/20. 
       On that day...? 
       Opobano is going to HAND YOU the PAPERWORK that TROOPER DICKSON started. 
       Its SUPPPOSED have the address 1602 on it, it’ll say 1609. 
       Then YOU, standing near my refrigerator right now, will HAND that ticket TO ME, like a football. 
       Tellin’ me I’ve got a FEDERAL CASE all STREWN OUT...
Cop1 : That’s right, man. 
       Maybe you should take a picture and paste it into this conversation here... 
       ...that way we have an idea of what we’re dealing with retroactively...
Me   : Alright... that’s actually a real good idea.
Cop1 : I know, it’s why I, Cop1, said that...

           Might shake my fist at ya...? 
           Might not. 
           Depends on what happened that day.
    Me   : Got it.
    Cop1 : THEN I’m gonna tell YOU, that our superiors can track us by our PHONES.
    Me   : K.
    Cop1 : I'll be on patrol with the blonde haired Trooper girl, who somehow keeps running into you throughout 2020. 
           The RADIOS we walk around with...? 
           I'm gonna have a conversation with you about how our superiors track us... using those as well. 
           Good so far...?
    Me   : Yeah, good. *thumbs up*
    Cop1 : Alright, THEN, I’m gonna tell YOU, that the camera systems in the trooper vehicles are like, worth 17K.

    Cop1 : THEN, I’m gonna tell ya to knock off the funny business, don’t be a lame bastard...
           ...then you’ll be free to go.
    Me   : Alright Mr. fuckin’ Marty McFly from the future, who somehow knows what’ll happen on 08/05/20...
           ...what if RIGHT NOW DURING THIS INTERACTION, there just so happens to be DEPUTY MESSINES who is REPORTED 
           as 2G62 but somehow he's wearin' an BLACK SCSO uniform, right...? 
           But he’s reported in the interaction as NYSP.
           Black uniform, not gray. 
           He’s alongside Paul Zurlo. 
           Paul and MESSINES JR. are talkin’ with my mother right now when this incident occurs. 
           It’s DEFINITELY not Anthony Agresta, cause he’s still standing right here. 
    AA   : Damn straight, I am. 
           That’s me. 
    Me   : Pretty sure that dude with Paul Zurlo, talking to my mother ISN’T a STATE TROOPER.
    AA   : Look pal, we’re just making sure you’re safe, they’re safe.
           Everybody’s safe. 
           Everywhere. 
           All the time. 
           Safe, or else.
    Me   : Cool. 
           Well, I’m NOT safe, cause 2 dudes who work with the STATION CHIEF at the CP Safety building, the guy   
           with GLASSES, I suspect that HE IS DOING SOMETHING MAD SHADY. 
           And, SO IS TROOPER BORDEN. 
           But also, obviously guys at SCSO. 
           Like, SCOTT SCHELLING and DEPUTY PIRRONE.
    Cop1 : Dude, Trooper Borden is like Robin, you’re not allowed to say stuff about HIM.
    Me   : ...Robin...?
    Cop1 : Yeh. 
           You heard me, Robin, like Robin and Batman.
    Me   : TROOPER BORDEN has made a number of slip ups. 
           I’m not callin’ the guy out for no reason. 
           06/18/20 is when I  first officially met this ‘Robin’... 
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(8,"Excerpt [~] Trooper Borden",@"
BORDEN’s (behaviors/responses) did not match a pattern where it caused any suspicion that he had ANY 
involvement whatsoever, in the attack on 5/26/20. In short, he wasn’t involved in the attack on 5/25-5/26 2020
I am absolutely certain of that.

However, when I first met him on 06/18/20, apparently he knew about my social media posts, as well as the 
pictures I took of the Verizon/Spectrum stuff, AND Catricala’s property, because he was asking a lot of 
questions about them...

I believe that BORDEN...:
- attempted to use his PERSONALITY to CHARM me, but failed
- I don’t think he’s gay (I’m gonna keep callin’ him a cocksucker for lying to me)
- covering for CATRICALA (6/18/20) 
- later ignored leads I kept trying to give to the police (6/22/20)
- called someone at Federal Counter-Terrorism Intelligence Agency
- apparently those EXPERTS had no idea PEGASUS/PHANTOM “existed”
- which means they’re either CARELESS, or not THOROUGH
- which would lead to the first public reporting of SOLORIGATE/2020 Federal Data Breach on (12/13/20)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach
- this was a SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACK
- it is EXTREMELY LIKELY that PEGASUS/PHANTOM was used to STAGE this attack
- I had evidence of this program being on my device 6 months before the attack
- I’m not pleased that I was MORE correct, than everyone who lied to me
- this event led to CPS taking custody of my children
- I have every reason to be pissed off
- Catricala knows people w/ access to PEGASUS, because that’s how he found me in APRIL 2020

    Me   : Trooper Borden already SAW the PICTURES I took of Catricala’s rear building, when he had to look through 
           my backpack at GT Toys on 06/18/20. I didn’t know then, was that... ERIC CATRICALA was the guy in the 
           WHITE SUV that was hunting me down on: 1) ASTOIA VUCETICS PROP. IN APRIL, 2) 06/20/20 NEW SALEM ROAD SOUTH
           CATRICALA FUNERAL HOME is DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM COMPUTER ANSWERS. 
           I think that dude, just so we’re clear on what dud I’m referring to...?
           It just so happens to be, NY State Assemblyman, ERIC CATRICALA.
           I believe that this dude has a legion of cybercommandos in his back pocket that can attack COMPUTERS,
           MOBILE DEVICES, CABLE MODEMS, TELEPHONE LINES, SmartTV’s, probably even Smart Dildos... you never know.
           If he knows who can hack a smartphone using Pegasus, then any electronic device is on the table.
           Then again, maybe this dude just as all the skills in the world, and does all this himself.
    Cop1 : Dude, nobody has a legion of cybercommandos in their back pocket, not unless you’re friggen Rex Power Colt 
           himself.
    Me   : Yeah...? Says you. I’m just sayin’ ERIC CATRICALA probably knows the top-shelf hackers at the FBI.
           I mean, lets have an honest discussion about it...
           If we were to pit the cybercommandos from each and every organization in the US government that HAS
           cybercommandos on deck... who do you think would win...?
           Cause, any legion of cybercommandos isn’t somethin’ anyone wants to be up against.
           They can practically karate chop people with their friggen eyebrows, if they wanted to.
    Cop1 : Nah bro, they cannot karate chop people with their eyebrows. 
           What the hell is wrong with you, pal...?
           Obviously, the Central Intelligence Agency.
    Me   : I said PRACTICALLY.
           And that’s a good pick, dude. Damn.
           *Cop1, Cop2, and Agresta all glance at each other, all have their eyebrows focused*
    Cop2 : The National Security Agency is nothing anybody wants to mess with...
    Me   : Yeah you’re right about that.
    AA   : Man, I can’t pick the same ones they did, huh...?
    Me   : I mean, you COULD.
    AA   : *sits there for a moment in deep thought*
           I dunno, man... this is TOUGH.
    Me   : It is.
           They all basically have the same teachers and skillsets.
           It’s sorta like “which child is your favorite child...?”
    AA   : Well, I’m gonna actually go with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
    Me   : Nice.
    Cop1 : What about you, you haven’t picked one.
    Me   : Uh, Microsoft. No hesitation.
    Cop2 : THAT’s a COMPANY... not a government agency.
    Me   : HEH. That’s what YOU think.
           It is a company.
           It is also where the worlds best software engineering has always taken place.
           That means, fully stocked with the fiercest cybercommandos known to man.
    Cop1 : That’s basically cheating though.
    Me   : Look, when ALL of these agencies need someone to give them a dose of wisdom...?
           Where you do think they go, I mean, really...?
    Cop2 : That is where I would go, actually...
    Cop1 : Not gonna lie, can’t even argue with you.
    AA   : I mean, look guys, we shouldn’t be pitting our own countrymen and cybercommandos against each other anyway.
    Me   : Alright, well, ERIC CATRICALA probably does not have Microsoft helpin’ him out.
           But it doesn’t make the cybercommandos at his table, any less dangerous or lethal.
    Cop1 : How...?    
    Me   : Well, I don’t really have an answer for ya...
           MAYBE he’s like a legitimate magician.
           Cause the dude showed up (2x) hours after I walked past 1134 New Scotland Road.
           The only reason I found that plate, and the car, is cause Scrotes Pirrone said to DJ Thompson, at the 
           Halfmoon Sheriff Substation, on: [06/01/20] 
           Scrotes     : Hey, what is this guy even doin’ here...?
           DJ Thompson : Ah, he fuckin’ SUPPOSEDLY jumped in front of a vehicle that the Captains kids were driving.
                         The ones that live off of farm to market road, called in... 
                         ...dude literally tried to jump in front of THEIR CAR, trying to damage their car. 
                         Like an asshole, dude.
           Scrotes     : *looks at me, palms up* Dude, what the hell is wrong with you...? 
                         Why would you jump in front of somebody’s car like that...?
                         *shakes head* Unbelievable...
           Me          : Nah bro, I didn’t jump in front of anybody’s car.
                         But hey, I’ll remember that one, if some dude is walking nearby...? 
                         OH... call 911 and tell THEM that they just haphazardly jumped in front of my car...
                         ...and I ran this IDIOT over NOW I gotta get my car fixed...
                         ...I think the guy is definitely dead though. Hold on...
                         *bang bang* Yeah he’s definitely dead.
           Scrotes     : You know that’s basically a crime right there, right...?
           Me          : Right. So like, that’s what the CAPTAINS KIDS tried to like DO. Dumbass.
           DJ Thompson : Hey. Don’t you insult this fuckin’ dude who’s standin’ here doin’ nothin’... Alright...?
                         Thought you were gonna be cool wit’ us...? Now you’re bein’ a douchebag...
           Me          : Bro. I HAVE A FUCKING ALIBI. WHAT DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT...?
           DJ Thompson : Dude, I already told YOU, that there’s nothing I can really do about that. Orders man.
           Me          : Oh. Ok.
           [06/01/20 *obviously ad-libbed, but the context is spot on]
           Anyway, yeah, this WHITE MERCEDES-BENZ SUV that can be seen PARKED in my friends neighbors driveway. 
           fuckin’ ERIC CATRICALA - 20 Anchor Drive, Waterford NY – that is the vehicle that was driving in and out 
           of every driveway, near NEW SALEM SOUTH ROAD, about 2 hours AFTER I passed 1134 New Scotland Road, and
           this dude was definitely trying to kill me, because he didn’t OPEN THE WINDOW and SAY A WORD... and he would  
           DRIVE OFF, and then try to fake me out, and come right back, but this dude is a dumbass, hate to say it.
    Cop1 : You do realize, that’s fuckin’ Eric god damn Catricala, right...? Dude’s a literal State Assemblyman. 
    Me   : Yeah, well, he’s also a stupid motherfucker that’s goin’ to prison at some point. 
           I don’t know though, maybe he’s not stupid at all, and he’s an incredibly intelligent bastard that’s gonna
           get me when I least expect it. 
           He like, tried to have Clayton Brownell ARREST ME for being at the CATRICALA FUNERAL HOME on 06/18/20.
           WASN’T EVEN ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE ROAD. That was AFTER I caught SCROTES PIRRONE TRYING TO BE SLICK.
           This dude, heard about the conversation I had with DR. ROBINSON, and the letter probably, and then ALSO heard 
           about how I stopped at CENTER FOR SECURITY, to request access to their security footage, since I know for damn
           certain, that camera in front of the place, caught my 2nd 911 call, on 05/26/20 0009
           Julie from Trickshot Billiards might even say something about me being a total fuckface douchebag on all
           accounts, but: “Oh yeah that dude, man. He WAS here, on 06/18/20, handed me a smashed-up purple 
           Samsung Galaxy S9+, and then this dude, he just, took off, man...”

    Cop1 : Buddy... that’s gotta be all nonsense... I go fishin’ with that dude... He’s a mad chill funeral home owner.
           There’s NO WAY that dude would ever hurt a fly.
    Me   : Ohhh alright. Maybe he was just trying to ask me if I wanted life insurance or something on the side of the 
           road, about 20+ miles from Clifton Park, just randomly happened to CONVENIENTLY be, in fuckin VOORHEESVILLE...
           MAGICALLY, CONVENIENTLY, 2 hours after I found that BLACK DODGE DART sitting in the CAPTAINS’ spot...
           Yeah, the guys at the Halfmoon substation said “Captains kids called this in”, so I saw this black dodge dart
           parked in front of the CAPTAIN’S spot.
    Cop1 : You know, you would HAVE to have EVIDENCE of something that serious... right? Cause, I’ll fuckin’ arrest ya 
           right now for sayin’ all this falsetto shit...
    Me   : Oh ok, so, I showed the god damn video of this kids face, to Shaemus Leavey, on 05/27/20 at about 9am. Leavey 
           only saw about the first minute of the video or so, and I’m pretty sure he’d remember that it was in front of 
           Catriala’s funeral home. Anyway, I’m gonna go backward in time to BEFORE all this shit started happening...
    Cop1 : What the hell is THAT supposed to mean, dude...? You’re not supposed to be able to flip back and forth through
           time like that... Not without a time permit or somethin’...
    Me   : THEN, I saw Trooper Leavey and showed him IMG_0647.mov which was a SINGLE file that CATRICALA’s CYBERCOMMANDO  
           BUDDIES were working REALLY FUCKIN HARD to PREVENT ME from EXFILTRATING from my DEVICE. They’ve been doin’ 
           this shit to me for like 3.5+ years now, believe it or not. I first noticed it back when I was at Computer
           Answers, and then suddenly, I had this suspicion that someone was ACTIVELY EAVESDROPPING ON THE DEVICES IN 
           THE STORE. 
           Almost like a legit case of OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. Well, it’s not even ALMOST, because it IS OOJ.
    Cop1 : Yeah but you still haven’t shown me that you’ve got a time-permit to show me stuff from the past like that...
    Me   : *ignores Cop1* After I showed Trooper Leavey THAT video, of the kid that DRIVES THAT CAR that HAD the LICENSE 
           PLATE NYS/DVA-02450 in front of the CATRICALA FUNERAL HOME, my phone screen went COMPLETELY BLACK. Wasn’t off.  
           Had to remove battery, plugged it back in, phone said “Fuck you dude.” I was CONVINCED that LEAVEY had some 
           hand in that, but- then I remembered that I fuckin used it for a minute after he drove away. My neighbor works 
           for the company CAPITAL DIGITRONICS which provides radio comm. equipment for the NYSP, in this area. 40Mi+
    Cop2 : Hey, listen buddy, we don’t have ALL DAY to talk about this hypothetical, non-realistic long ass convo that 
           you’re not even allowed to do, without a time-permit... So...
    Me   : *ignores Cop2* | Tom McCabe: (03/21/22) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYKHBlJFC4-w8K1q0ROM4CvLF0dfwdbo
            ^ Capital Digitronics guy/owner COOL DUDE, HE didn’t hack HIS OWN comm. equipment. FBI (did/had access).
           ERIC CATRICALA then ASKED SCSO James Leonard to DO SOMETHING, FAST. SCSO-2020-003177 with SCOTT CARPENTER.

(05/27/20 1414) [SCSO-2020-003177] 
Carpenter, Scott: On the above date and time, I responded to the listed address for a report of a 
SUSPICIOUS SUBJECT[01]. Upon arrival, I was met by Eric “god damn” Catricala[02]. Eric stated that
he responded to his funeral home on 05/24/20 at about 8:00 because an alarm was set off[03]. 

While inside the building, Eric heard a knock on the door[04]. There was a male not known to Eric, wearing
tan pants and a blue and white checkered shirt[05]. The man who was [later identified as Michael C. Cook*]
told Eric that he needs to stop taking his computer to Computer Answers to have work done[06]. 

Michael told Eric that they put stuff on his computers so that they can track everything he does[07]. 
Eric told Michael that he does not use them anymore and asked him to leave[08]. MASSIVE SPLOTCHES OF THE
OL’ WHITE-OUT-SHOUT-OUT PROBABLY A LONG POINT I MADE TO CATRICALA ABOUT BRUCE TANSKI, KELLY/LESTER WORMUTH, 
and PAUL AMATO[09]. 

Patrol checked the property for damage which yielded negative results[10]. 
[Eric is requesting periodic area checks* 72 hours later…] of the Catricala Funeral Home located at 
1597 Route 9, in the town of Clifton Park[11]. Patrol to follow up with Michael Next shift[12].

[01] SUSPICIOUS SUBJECT somehow being reported as suspicious, 3 days late… is pretty fuckin suspicious already,
     ya know…? "Ah man, SHOULD'VE taken a call (3) days ago, but- I didn't. Oh well". 
     TICKET WAS SUBMITTED AFTER SEEING LEAVEY 5/27/20, and AFTER MY PHONE WAS DISABLED REMOTELY.
[02] That’s correct, he’s fuckin’ Eric “God damn” Catricala alright... 
[03] He was already at this place when I walked up to it, AND, it was more like 7:05-7:10PM
[04] Correct. I did knock on the door... real politely too.
[05] Correct. Had a blue checkered shirt on and tan pants. Good.
[06] I said a lot more than what was written, because most of the conversation was about BRUCE TANSKI, 
     WORMUTH, and the guy PAUL AMATO who I didn’t know his name, I just knew that TANSKI had gotten arrested, 
     or something. I didn’t know that it was PAUL AMATO, the guy who floated TANSKI like `$60M for Kings Isle. 
     Tanski is doing some incredibly dirty shit with Hoffman and Catricala. 
     Whether that’s fuckin’ each other in the ass, or just committing fraud, it’s all the same to me.
[07] Realistically, CATRICALA may have been involved in the CYBERATTACK that occurred on JANUARY 15th, 2019, 
     along with an FBI man, and/or my cousin RYAN WARD, since he knows who the (2) guys are.
     CIA VAULT 7 does that shit too.
[08] Eric never ASKED me to leave, I just said “Alright, thanks. I’m all set take care.” and then left.
     No incident.
[09] I believe that JAMES LEONARD had sex with MICHAEL ZURLO and then he jizzed all over this document,
     and that’s why it has so much “white out” on it.
[10] Correct, cause I didn’t do anything to his property, didn’t take anything from it, didn’t care about it...
     I heard something in the woods and thought it was coming from that building on...
     05/25/20 2340ish (28 hours later)
[11] I too, would like to request periodic checks 3 days late, but for the next foreseeable 48 hours, 
     so that it will look like I fuckin’ had someone legally arrested... yeah. 
     That’s how retarded this ticket is.
[12] Nobody ever followed up with me.

This ticket was supposed to SUPPLEMENT the ticket SCSO-2020-003173…

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
(05/27/20 1212) [SCSO-2020-003173] 
Martin, Michael: I was dispatched to 1771 Route 9 in the town of Clifton Park, in regard to an ongoing 
issue[1]. Upon my arrival, I was met by the complainant, Zachary Karel[2]. The complainant stated that 
he was disturbed by the Facebook posts involving the want to purchase a firearm, that had been posted
by the suspect of an earlier complaint made by Zachary involving the strap to his kayak rack being cut
(not the phone line)[3].

Zachary showed me the Facebook posts of the subject, Michael Cook (← not my friend on Facebook, that
means he’s stalking me)[4]. I read through the post and determined that there were no direct threats to
Zachary [5]. 

However, I advised Zachary that if he feels (unsafe/like a big pussy) because of his recent complaint
involving Michael Cook, he could obtain a protection order at the Saratoga County Family Court office[6].
Zachary felt that would be a good idea[7]. 

Zachary also requested that I make advisement to Michael, advising Michael that he is not allowed on his
property 1769 Route 9, and his place of employment 1771 Route 9[8]. Deputy Thompson and I patrolled to the
residence of Michael Cook at 201D* Halfmoon circle, in the town of Halfmoon[9]. 

We made contact with Michael and were engaged in a conversation regarding both… (2 dudes probably associated
with Karel) and how the property owners are advising that Michael is not allowed on the properties[10]. 

During the conversation, Deputy Thompson asked Michael “Let me ask you a straight up question, did you cut
the kayak straps (OR did you cut the phone line)[11]? 

Michael responded to deputy Thompson with a bullshit response (that I just said YEAH to cause I was also 
admitting to cutting the PHONE LINE because I was attempting to contact 911 SOMEHOW)[12]. 
Based on Michael’s admission to cutting the kayak strap (not the phone line we don’t give a shit about that,
right)[13], I placed Michael under arrest for the charge of (Crim. Misch. 4th° PL whatever doesn’t fuckin’
really matter we’re just bullshitting an arrest and ignoring crimes)[14] 

I (did not) transport Michael to the Halfmoon station for arrest processing (because DJ Thompson did that)[15]. 
I (did not) process (or) fingerprint Michael (because DJ Thompson ALSO did that) on the aforementioned charge
and (did not) release him on an appearance ticket (because DJ Thompson did that) to etc[16]. 

So forth, the rest is basically whatever. It was dropped to ACOD, but guess what...? 
They stapled a verbal admission report with a TOTALLY INCORRECT TIME on it. 
----
[01] Not an ongoing issue, it happened like *checks watch* 05/26/20 0130 → 05/27/20 1212 | about 36h LATER. 
     Cool.
     By the way, I spoke to Trooper Leavey like, LONG before this ticket was written, as well as the other one.
     [SAME SUPERIOR OFFICER, JAMES LEONARD*] handled BOTH of these tickets. 
     Which causes me to believe that [ZACKARY KAREL] and [ERIC CATRICALA] are [ASSOCIATED*]. (← EXCELLENT WORK, MORONS)
[02] Probably wasn’t lying about who he really is.
[03] Dude’s not my friend on Facebook, whether my profile, or commentary is public or not...?
     Who the fuck is giving him this information...?
     Do random people just follow what I’m doing...?
     OR, is the OWNER of FACEBOOK just PROVIDING PEOPLE my information...?
     Like CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA...?
     In other words, these people don’t realize how retarded they sound writing this report.
[04] Yeah. That LITERALLY means the dude is looking me up, for whatever reason.
     Maybe, he waited like 36 hours cause he really wanted to find some way to get in my pants, who knows…?
[05] I think what’s really happening is that a group of people that do some stuff for Mark Zuckerberg, they go around
     using these technology exploits, so that they can kill people. I can’t specify with certainty that ZACKARY KAREL
     is part of the GROUP OF SERIAL KILLERS, but I can say that he was probably following me with his drone.
[06] Dude feels UNSAFE because he’s STALKING ME, and because I had (2) guys try to kill me the night
     before, ah, me mentioning I wanted to purchase a firearm for my own protection actually caused this dude 
     to be quite butt hurt by the second amendment.
[07] It WOULD feel like a good idea, if maybe someone was used to being able to STALK people and just, treat me as if
     I’m property, or a product. They “allegedly” feel unsafe because I know that someone is trying to treat me like
     PROPERTY. THAT is why he feels that it would be a good idea.
     That way, if I actually kick the shit out of him, I just go to jail or prison. Ya know...? 
     That dude can come STAB ME TO DEATH, but if I actually lightly slap him across the face…? 
     Oh no, I’ll get JAIL TIME, or something.
     These orders of protection can be ABUSED, and they often ARE.
     Because someone that’s not doing anything worthy enough to get one placed or written, they can LITERALLY BE
     DEFENSELESS. And, if <that dude kicks the shit out of me>, then <I could still get arrested for that>. 
     Does that sound stupid…? 
     Oh, well, nobody fuckin’ cares if that sounds stupid, that’s currently how it works.
[08] I went back to the Feiden Appliance Center multiple times requesting footage for 05/26/20 0100-0130, because
     I was trying to obtain the record SCSO-2020-028501. Which I submitted a records request/FOIL on 09/04/20, which
     I got on 09/09/20, which DID NOT have my 911 call transcription from 06/13/20 for SCSO-2020-003564 MARK SHEEHAN,
     NOR did it have that 2020-028501/CALL FOR SERVICE. (← my alibi) 
     I wouldn’t get this ticket number until I spoke to CAPTAIN JEFFREY BROWN, INVESTIGATOR around 02/04-06/21 
[09] They did indeed patrol to my house, it didn’t appear as if they had any malicious intent or anything. 
     They just flat out, either DID NOT CARE about the phone line, or DID NOT KNOW about the phone line. 
     I think that they DID NOT KNOW. 
     I know for a DAMN FACT, that if I went around cutting people’s phone lines, I WOULD GET IN DEEP SHIT FOR THAT.
     Why did I not get in trouble for that on THIS particular night...? oh. 
     It’s cause 2 douchebags that are friends with ERIC CATRICALA were using a tool called PEGASUS/PHANTOM. 
     I didn’t know that’s what it was called back then, I just KNEW that the program HAD to exist, because I had a
     feeling that someone was watching me on my device and interacting with my touchscreen display as far back as... 
     October 2018.
[10] Well, I’m really saddened by the fact that I’m not allowed there anymore. Oh nos. 
     I might cry myself to death... Nah, really I don’t care.
[11] At the time, I did not know what the hell was going on at this house, BUT- I do know, that the 2 dudes that were
     trying to RUN ME OVER, were in his house. At that time that I cut the 1) strap, AND the 2) phone line at about 0130AM.
     My phone was DEAD, I was terrified of going into the woods by myself, I had a feeling that unless I got somebody’s
    attention somehow, I was a dead man.
[12] ^ . [13] Oh well. [14] Bummer. [15] ACOD which means it’s basically a bullshit charge anyway. It was ONLY meant to 
     prevent me from being able to have somebody arrested for using this program PEGASUS/PHANTOM. It’s fucking dangerous.
     I don’t really know how I caught these guys, but I used every trick in the fuckin’ book and I caught a number of 
     exhibits.

----

LITERALLY TRIED TO TIE THE EVENTS of 05/24/20 around 7PM, to the events of 05/25/20 around 1135PM well, 
they didn’t try, that’s what they actually went ahead and did. 

Then, 5 minutes after that dude left, my phone had a BLACK SCREEN. So, I unplugged the battery. Then I plugged 
it back in, then it said “Fuck you bro, it’s all locked and gone.” I was amazed, cause my phone shouldn’t be rude 
like that... Most rude-ass fuckin’ message a phone has ever shown me.
     
Now, maybe they were able to read all of the stuff I had, without actually opening any of the notebooks, or just,
maybe each police officer has superman vision. And, I’m the asshole for not knowing that. They were able to obtain
information about all of the stuff written in a BOX full of notebooks, faster than I could even detect.

That’s when they made a suggestion... "I don’t see the problem..."
Oh wait, nah that shit is impossible. They made an assumption and fucked off just like Cooper did back when 
Whitacre, Sheehan, and Hughes were at my house...
...joining forces after deciding to write a letter of indication that threw me into the State Central Registry 
for being a child abuser.

No marks or bruises on my kids.
Nah, that’s because I would literally beat my (2) children to death with my bare hands, but then suddenly…?
They’ve got the same fuckin' healing factor as Wolverine, ya know, the dude from the X-Men that can heal 
instantly. So, each time I beat my children to death, each one of these little fuckers would instantly heal 
right back to full health, each time, and then they would start laughing at me too...
   
Kid : Hahaha dad, I’m STILL alive~!
Me  : Ooooohhhh my god you LITTLE SHIT...

I kid you not, I have done it hundreds of thousands of times…? Every fuckin' time...? They laugh in my face.
But shockingly, I’ve never left a single mark on either one of these kids…
I can tell ya, there’s a reason why… my kids have some Wolverine shit goin’ on. OR…

I was just kidding, it’s because I’ve never beaten my kids. 
But, that doesn’t matter if the GOVERNMENT is CORRUPT.
No evidence collected.
Nothing except a letter that my mother wrote, because she’s fuckin’ stupid. Yeah. 
My mother, retard sometimes. Doesn’t realize that I’m just smarter than SHE is, and the DOCTOR at the hospital.
And, Eric Schnakenberg. A whole list of other people too, but, my mother decided to be a cunt that day, 
and write a letter that isn’t even true...
...to this woman named Laura Hughes.
And that was that.
		
Some people probably will tell me that I need to be nice to people, then this shit won’t happen.
That doesn’t actually work, believe it or not. If anything, it allows people to lie to your face.
That’s what I think about Dale Carnegie’s book, “How to win friends and influence people”
It’ll work if people like you based on your appearance.
Then that book is amazingly helpful.
Doesn’t work when you’re actually smarter than most people.
		
Yeah, anyway, on May 26th, 2020, I said something about my cousin Bookie Ward, and Tati Cleveland.
I was walking around, just saying whatever the fuck I could to manipulate these people I knew were listening 
and following me around... then I also saw (3) sheriffs drive down 146, toward Fire Road, and then turn right 
onto Fire road, toward the fire station.

Those units were listening to my feed.
They were listening to my feed when I was standing behind the old county courthouse across from Snyders.
Maybe they weren’t, I have no concrete idea whether the LOCAL police were doing that or not, but it seemed 
to follow a pattern.
		
Someone with an axe to grind against Julien or Ed Snowden, they might feel like eavesdropping on any 
citizen with a smartphone, ESPECIALLY if someone such as myself, keeps talking or writing about them. 
Really, it’s a lot easier than people think. They can do this to anybody, who owns a device where they 
have the mac address for. Sometimes that’s just as easy as looking up an invoice from the place you 
purchased a phone.

Other times, you just ask Apple for a specific account, where someone called in for remote support from 
Apple. Apple, might even try to tell people there’s no fucking way they can just connect to any device 
they’ve made... right? But they fuckin’ definitely can. And they can even lie about it too.
	
Some people will reason with themselves, "there’s no way they could or would do that..."        (<- that’s a FALLACY)
Right, there’s no way that morons constantly say stuff like that either.                        (<- that’s a FALLACY)
Oh wait, yeah there is... an invalid circle of logic where someone has ‘faith’ that Apple isn’t doing that.
They’re worth `$3T. There’s no way they would lie to people, you’re right.                       (<- that’s a FALLACY)
There’s 3 trillion ways that they could lie to people.
It is supposed to be UNLIKELY, that’s what people SHOULD say. 
When they say "it is unlikely", they can be given an update where they realize how rare my situation is.

They can say "Ah my bad. Didn’t realize you are an actual expert." 
Why would I tell people I’m an expert...? Cause I used to repair those fuckin’ phones for a living.
The police never comprehend that at all... Even Trooper Carter, saw me holding the phone... 
Plugged the battery back into the device, and powered it on.
Then the date said "June 7th, 2020" and this moron who ignored basically every fuckin’ word I said, 
asked me "How did you get the phone to show the date like that...?"
		
It’s cause you’re a fucking moron. Right there and then, he could’ve realized my situation was RATHER 
RARE AFTER ALL.
But, he didn’t. Just went right back to being a useless fuckstain that doesn’t give a shit.
Could’ve changed my entire perception of our interaction if he gave a flying fuck. But- oh well. Donuts.

Maybe if I’m nice to Trooper Carter NEXT time, he can casually act that way, rather than to be afraid 
of having his legs broken. There’s a theme here. People not giving a shit, when I am calm, level headed,
and know what I’m talking about...

They will tell me that I’m probably wrong.
Then I have to insist, that maybe they’re an idiot instead.
Then they insist that they’re not an idiot, because they’re a professional.
Then I tell them, obviously not, because I actually know what I’m talking about since I happen to be an expert...
...which is more educated than a professional.
Then they will get offended by the truth.
Then they will say that they don’t have to answer to me because... 
...I may be an expert, but that doesn’t give me the right to tell them the truth.
But, they don’t realize how stupid they sound while they’re being recorded on an audio recording...
...then they have jizz-on-the-chin.

I won’t tell them that I just recorded them in an audio recording... 
I’ll just ENSNARE them with it, and watch how the system responds.
		
Audio recordings are the ultimate weapon against morons.
However, the recordings really piss off the system, because if Laura Hughes made a mistake, they have to 
work a lot harder to ignore me for a while. 

Then if I record Judge Pelagalli’s voice, in a court appearance, nobody will understand why I made 
that fucking recording to begin with.
Even if I tell the cunt that happens to be my lawyer, she’s gonna ignore that completely.
		
So, there is no point in being nice to people if they begin to show signs of resistance.
They have a predetermined intention, and I can tell from the microexpressions in people’s voices.
The people that are actually processing things I say, will sound a lot more like Michael Whitacre from SCSO...
...where he is asking me QUESTIONS, rather than making STATEMENTS.
		
As far as Paul Pecor, Jeffrey Margan, Jared Gardner, Daniel Nelson...
...one of these guys said to me in the audio recording I recorded on March 1st, 2022, 
"All of this stuff you’re saying...? Sounds crazy~!"
		
Right, but that dude might be an idiot who doesn’t understand this sentence.
If it SOUNDS crazy, but it’s ACCURATE, then that means it’s not crazy at all. You are.
		
Digital security, fuckface. 
You stick to driving your vehicle around, I’ll stick to knowing what the fuck I’m talking about. Got it?

$Book.AddSection(8,"Asking the Accused",@"
These guys don’t like being put in check. It is literally that simple. 
So if I tell them that Dwayne steals shit from customers and from software distributors, 
...that doesn’t make sense to them... 

“How can he steal software...?” It’s not a question they ever ask. Not once, either.
I know that people used to see posts or comments I made, and then go ask him... but that’s what 
society does, man. Like, Ron Goldman and Nicole Simpson were found dead.

OJ   : *nostrils flared* Excuse me...?

Even Linus Sebastian would know how to steal software from Adobe, and I might’ve given that kid a hard time...
...but I’m certain that he’s got more integrity than Dwayne or Pavel.
    
The kicker is this. 
Rich people can buy this program, Pegasus/Phantom... the fact that it even EXISTS... SOUNDS crazy, 
but it’s ACCURATE. So, whichever of these guys Paul Pecor, Jeffrey Margan, Jared Gardner, 
Daniel Nelson said that it sounds crazy...? It does sound crazy, but it’s accurate. 
So, shut the fuck up... thanks.
    
When they do purchase this program, they have to be trained on how to use it by the NSO Group in Israel.
Citizen Lab, knows this shit exists. 
SCSO, a police organization in Saratoga County, existed since 1795 or something... 
None of them know who Citizen Lab is.
Ed Snowden, knows who they are. 
Al Jezeera, knows who they are.
Jake Sullivan, National Security Analyst, probably knows who Citizen Lab is.
    
I’d be willing to bet...? 
What I stumbled onto, was something very few people ever actually detect.
I’m saying, EXTREMELY fucking rare... because most people don’t know they’re being watched or targeted.
I did, because of the ransomware attack that occurred in tandem of CVE-2019-8936, on January 15th, 2019.
Did I mention that at all...? 
Ah, yeah. I fuckin’ definitely did... 
Sorry if I’m coming across as a condescending dickhead while the police are busy eatin’ fuckin donuts all day.
Then I recorded evidence that I couldn’t get OFF of the fucking device, even though I tried SEVERAL TIMES... 
...and THAT is why my phone is disabled.
    
Because, the `$3T company that made my device, these people really are fuckin’ morons.
Might not really be morons, so much as “careless”.
Pegasus/Phantom is an advanced program, a series of exploits and remote code execution channels, that allow 
a remote party to have ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL over a users device and can be deployed to a target device 
with NO USER INTERACTION. Typically, those vulnerabilities are disclosed to the manufacturer, but NSO Group 
(they made Pegasus/Phantom) does NOT disclose them at all.

The NSO Group found “zero-day vulnerabilities”, and hasn’t disclosed any of them for a REASON.
Apple can’t even protect people from this program, even though they made the device.
Sucks to hear that out loud, doesn’t it?
That’s what a `$3T has to constantly reject and deny, even though, IT IS TRUE.
So, calling Tim Cook a fuckin’ queer over and over again, is sorta pointless. He can’t do a fuckin’ thing to 
protect people from this program. Why...?

Every one of those “zero day exploits” involves RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT, AND, if the people who WORK at Apple 
have infected devices... guess how involved some foreign party will be in the software development of iOS...?

Oh. MAYBE they’re not being spied on while they’re making the newest device. Maybe it’s just a coincidence. 
Maybe they have spies working there that haven’t been caught yet. Maybe, ANYBODY could be a lying bastard, 
and that people shouldn’t HASTILY jump to every conclusion that seems the most obvious... I’m sure Apple has 
very good control or knowledge over “whos a fuckin’ spy then” and “who isn’t”... 

But, obviously the NSO Group isn’t disclosing these vulnerabilities, nor how they found them, so it stands to 
reason that whatever their methodology is...? Expect many other agencies to follow suit. All because of shit 
like San Bernadino.
    
Some agency that is in the middle of the desert halfway around the world, is able to slice right through 
all of Apple’s security countermeasures. Without even trying, too.
    
It’s like this. Apple tells people, it’s security is like a fuckin’ chastity belt, you’re not bangin’ a 
girl that’s wearing one... cause she’s wearing something that can’t be bypassed without a key.
    
Then, telling Apple to fuck off, you’ve got a "key" alright... a skeleton key, to unlock that thing, slide 
that girls panties to the side... and bang the snot out of her anyway.
When you’re done, you can have her put the thing back on, and nobody is none the wiser.
    
That’s what Pegasus/Phantom is/does. Basically fucks a girl even wearing a chastity belt.

So these (3-4) guys here (Paul Pecor, Jeffrey Margan, Jared Gardner, Daniel Nelson)...
...none of them are CAPABLE of knowing THIS exploit MAY be on their device too.
    
None of them know about Central Intelligence Agency tools, like Vault 7
None of them went to school to become a Microsoft Certified Professional.
None of them probably know how to type "google.com" into an actual web browser...
None of them probably know what a zip file is. 
None of them probably know what a cell phone does when people use one.
So... if they don’t know any of these fuckin’ things, they really have no fuckin’ business telling me that
Pegasus/Phantom sounds crazy...
Wanna know why they do that anyway...?
    
Cause, they really don’t give a shit if they’re wrong.
That’s what guys like Mark Zuckerberg do. 
They do that because it causes people to THINK that anything they would never agree EXISTS... 
"That’s way bad, bro. Crazy."

When these fuckin’ dudes from SCSO say "This stuff sounds crazy", it does SOUND crazy, but just cause 
something SOUNDS crazy, doesn’t mean it’s crazy at all.
It’s like "What if I kicked the shit out of 3 dudes form SCSO in a single fight...?"
SOUNDS crazy, but if I just went ahead and did that, they wouldn’t think it was that crazy if they’re 
waking up on the floor several minutes later.
If that last sentence sounds crazy, it means that someone knocked them all unconscious, and then they 
woke up not knowing how they got there.
    
SOUNDS crazy, but since they ALL doubted it, well... they didn’t see it coming.
That’s the parallel. The element of surprise.

Not saying I’m gonna do that, what I’m saying is... 
...3 dudes, nowhere near as intelligent as I am...
...nowhere near as experienced with technology as I am...
...came into my fuckin’ room...
...heard what I had to say...
...and attempted to tell me I don’t know what the fuck I’m talking about...
...then they forcibly brought me to Saratoga Hospital against my will...
...causing me to be extremely aggravated.

Anyone reading the lawsuit material...?
Well, lawsuits are bogus.
They don’t actually exist.
They’re all staged from what I can tell.
    
I don’t want any one of these guys to get killed by some serial killer that has their device hacked.
But I know that if someone wanted to do that...?
It would be WAY too fucking easy.
That’s how clueless they are.
    
Even if the Russians literally sent me a message using Western Union that said:
"We’re going to hack the entire federal government on December 8th, 2020, and there’s nothing you fucks can 
do to stop us. HAHAHAHAHAH~! Fuck you guys. -VLADIMIR PUTIN"
...well... 
The police will be too busy eatin’ donuts, to give a shit.

Pretty OBVIOUS who sent the message, VLADIMIR PUTIN sent it, cause it says his name.
And, it’s got a date on the thing too.
But, oh well. It’s a perfect clue... it will be ignored.
THEN, after they do this on that exact date, and that person was definitely involved, the police will 
just say...

"There’s no way we could ever have known. If only we had known, or had some type of advanced warning... 
We could’ve fuckin’ avoided that whole disaster." -The police

If I didn’t experience what I have since January 15th, 2019 → Now, I wouldn’t go around telling people that 
most people are morons. The truth is, most people probably AREN’T morons at all, they’re just fed so many lies 
every day, they just take people at their word, because it’s a lot easier.

$Book.AddSection(8,"Exclusion",@"
Lets say that every single person, everything they ever said was a lie.
Then the only way people would know for sure that they can trust what the hell’s going on, is by ignoring 
everything people say...
...and judge them based on their BODY LANGUAGE, TONE OF THEIR VOICE, AND VERBALIZED RESPONSES.

OH. WAIT A SECOND... I’ve just described how PSYCHOLOGY works...
Judging people’s BODY LANGUAGE is MORE TRUSTWORTHY than WHAT THEY SAY (in most cases).

When the BODY LANGUAGE supports the WORDS, then it can be SAFELY ASSUMED, that they’re not lying after all.
But, if they’re offering to show someone PROOF or EVIDENCE, that SUPPORTS what they SAY...
...maybe the LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM, and the JUSTICE SYSTEM...
...they can make it so that EVIDENCE can only be admitted to a courtroom...
...if somebody PAYS a lawyer...
...so, if THEY appoint one FOR you, then [THEY MAY actually IGNORE any evidence that exists*]... (*Not in all cases)
...that’d include the cops.

SCSO James Leonard literally did this, by stapling an oral admission I made, of cutting a kayak strap in 
the same moment as a dude’s phone line, right...? Cause I tried to call 911 from a device that had this 
software exploit deployed to it, and fuckin’ you would not believe this... My 911 calls were ignored. 

Anyway, they didn’t really care about the phone line, SHOULD’VE BEEN A MUCH HIGHER PROIRITY BELIEVE IT OR 
NOT. Scott Schelling’s incident/call for service was my alibi.
    
The government won’t make money off of people that obey the law, but they don’t make money off of criminals 
EITHER so they had to come up with a brilliant way to be indifferent to them all...
...and they’re cool with innocent people getting in trouble...
...so whether you’re innocent or guilty of anything you’re accused of...
...doesn’t really matter, you have to pay the lawyer who might not even be needed...
...if you want people in a courtroom to consider any evidence of something happening...
...so the government can actually commit cyberattacks and identity theft...
...and that’s how they support themselves.
    
While that is pretty BAD... 
The government does plenty of shit that’s a lot fuckin’ worse than that, believe it or not.
    
Yeah, they can allow a guy like Richard "Dick Tackler" Sackler, to basically be a drug kingpin and make 
billions of dollars off of imported opiates from Afghanistan. Probably sounds crazy, what I just said. 
SOUNDS crazy... but, it’s accurate. So many people will immediately flat out reject something if it 
SOUNDS crazy. 

But- it’s not crazy if it’s true. Nah. If something SOUNDS crazy, but it happens to be fuckin’ accurate...? 
That means it’s not crazy at all... it JUST means, that [YOU’VE BEEN FOOLED*] along with many other people.

Let me repeat it a slightly different way...
It’s not crazy or unbelievable... it just sounds fucked up to say out loud. I agree. It fuckin’ happens though...
    
Richard Sackler, being the "treated like royalty" scumbag that he is, can then do things that ARE illegal...
...but because he is a special person with "privileges", he can break the law as often as he pleases...
...and be given a free pass over and over, because... 
...I already mentioned this... 
...he has the superhuman ability to spread his ass cheeks for anybody. 
    
Even Ted Cruz and Tim Cook are EXTREMELY jealous.
Most females ALSO jealous... none of them can spread their ass cheeks as wide as Richard Sackler can.
Rarely is he ever detected by people, bending himself over...? 
Running around backwards at top speed...? 
Chasing people down with his ass cheeks spread wide open...?
...making noises like "nom nom nom nom"...
...like, the fuckin’... cookie monster from Sesame Street.

What I just said...? 
That probably sounds crazy too. But, it’s not as fucked up as what I said in the prior paragraph.
Cause people should ask questions; like "Why would he do all that...?"
It’s a great question. 
Why does the government not care if he breaks the law, but anyone else that breaks the law, gets the full penalty...?

Well, it’s cause it’s cool if HILLARY CLINTON leaks classified stuff, she’ll be given a "warning".
But if JULIEN ASSANGE releases a video like "Collateral Murder", then that’s gotta be worth 175 years in prison. 
No if’s, and’s or but’s.
To me...? That sounds crazy too... 
But, that’s why I use these colorful, descriptive metaphors to describe how many morons in the government 
there are.
    
They’re not that stupid, they’re assuming that people won’t do anything about it, and it’s an ignorant way 
to think.
    
As for Richard Sackler, probably sounds like the purist form of homosexuality, grown ass man, running around
chasing people with his ass cheeks spread wide open... but the government allows him to do that. 
So... what can anybody do?
    
It’s fuckin’ stupid man. 
What’s more ridiculous though: 
- government abusing mass surveillance tools
- Richard Sackler chasing people with his ass cheeks wide open making the cookie monster sounds?
    
Cause... ^ both of these things are pretty terrifying.
    
Whether it’s Richard Sackler running around flapping his ass cheeks open and closed sounding like the 
fuckin’ cookie monster... OR ...people chasing me down using this program Pegasus/Phantom to try and kill me... 
    
The government will operate on the assumption that people will *NEVER* be smart enough to catch on.
They are very accurate.
Andrew Cuomo, could be sucking some dudes dick right now as I write this...
...and some people will say "That sounds crazy" even though it could be accurate.

The government uses this shit all the time, so, they’re not that dumb at all... are they?
SOUNDS crazy, but IS true... NOT crazy at all.
You could say this shit thousands of times, and people won’t get it...
If something sounds crazy, most people shut that shit down right there and then.
Print it out, and tell people the truth, but if the truth fuckin’ offends them in any way, or it sounds 
like someone did drugs or whatever...
...then, the truth doesn’t matter.
Not at all.
    
When I recorded this dipshit on video, he stopped dead in his tracks. Right outside of the Catricala Funeral 
Home. Scott Carpenter... could’ve seen this dipshit on his security footage Catricala showed Carpenter, if he 
was lookin’ for him... but amazingly, Eric Catricala didn’t tell him about that.
    
I never actually HAD an issue with Catricala, up until I saw an SUV drive into the parking lot at the vacant 
driving range property across from the post office.
Back in April 2020.
Yeah, someone... had a GPS position from my device that had no access to the internet. HM. WEIRD.
They drove into the parking lot and immediately turned their lights off... 
That... scared the shit out of me because that meant that someone had my location somehow, and that the 
FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW I saw over the last couple months...
...and the BLUE TRUCK I kept seeing on Cemetery Road...
...they were related somehow.
Huh. Imagine that?
Cemetery Road and Bruce Tanski go hand-in-hand like fuckin’ peanut butter and jelly. 
Mainly because, his office is at the beginning of the fuckin’ road and stuff... there’s no WAY that he would ever 
allow himself to be associated with...
...Cemetery Road at all...
...is there?

Well, think again, fuckface. 
I spoke to Catricala about Mr. Tanski, cause I observed a chain of coincidences that made me suspicious, 
and Catricala never mentioned anything about Bruce Tanski in the report that he filed with Scott Carpenter.

So when I FOIL requested the records, I can pull up what Catricala told Scott Carpenter... believe it or not.
    
That’s right. I spoke to him about Bruce Tanski on May 24th, 2020.
He didn’t say a god damn thing about my conversation with him recording Bruce Tanski. 
Wanna know why...?
Same reason that nobody reported me having cut the phone like at Zachary Karels house... 
That detail was a LOT more important than a fuckin’ kayak strap, but... who gives a shit? 
    
Well, when I tell people that going around and cutting phone lines is actually a pretty serious offense, 
they ignore the part where I was trying to call 911. Yeah. They get mad at me too..

Me      : Uh, they didn’t arrest me for THAT, dipshit...
Someone : YEAH WELL, THEY SHOULD’VE... 
Me      : Right, and Scott Schelling SHOULD HAVE collected my evidence of me calling 911,
          about 90 minutes before he arrived at Zappone.
Someone : IT’S NOT HIS JOB TO DO THAT. 
          HE WOULD’VE RESPONDED TO THE 911 CALL IF YOU CALLED 911.
Me      : Yeah, if I tell him that I was almost killed, and tried to call 911, phone was hacked, 
          and I have screenshots that prove it... (I didn’t know my phone was hacked to that degree)
Me      : That IS his job.
Someone : YEAH WELL, FUCK YOU ANYWAY BRO. 
          NOBODY HAS TO BELIEVE YOU AT ALL.

I don’t think people really understand the severity of James Leonard’s decision making process at all, but...
...I still obtained clues from a report.
    
I think the problem is that MOST people never actually request records from the County Records department.
So, they will immediately tell someone that they’re outside of their mind, if I claim that the police lie a lot.
The problem is, they fuckin’ definitely DO lie a lot on MOST of their reports. Why...?
Because they’re writing down their PERCEPTIONS, and their PERCEPTION may not be very ACCURATE at all, 
especially if...
...someone making a statement is KNOWINGLY PROVIDING FALSE TESTIMONY TO A POLICE OFFICER ON A WRITTEN INSTRUMENT.
    
So if their perception is that Eric Catricala is a fucking outstanding citizen...

            Who says that...?
Carpenter : I mean, *looks at Catricala suspiciously*... 
            ...is that what you’re doin’...? *wink*
Catricala : Nah man. 
            *I* don’t throw bodies into concrete foundations...
Carpenter : Someone you know probably *does* though, huh?
Catricala : Look man, I’m trying to stay level headed here. 
            He had a friggen flashlight and stuff...
Carpenter : OOO. 
            Flashlight, eh?
       That’s definitely something right there, man. 
            Flash... *jots that down* ...light.
Catricala : Dude... 
            I’ll show you the footage, 
            but you should retroactively add this report to your records as a single record.
Carpenter : Oh yeah...? 
            Why’s that...?
Catricala : Because I’d like you guys to pretend like I left ya a voicemail or some shit...
            ...and I wanted periodic checks of the property.
Carpenter : ...even though this is like, 3 days ago, right?
Catricala : Right. 
Carpenter : That’s like, not legal for me to do that... *obnoxiously chewing gum*
Catricala : Oh, I’ll fuckin’ give you somethin’ to be legal about in a minute, buddy...
Carpenter : Dude. 
            I’m just saying, if this guy requests records, we can’t be found inserting records around willy-nilly.
Catricala : James Leonard will do it. 
            You just have to take the report.
Carpenter : Well, you want me to insert (2) separate incidents, into the same record... 
            *chewing gum* ...then you’re asking ME to do something illegal.
Catricala : Who cares dude? 
            I’m Eric Catricala, I’m like a friggen State Assemblyman for Christ’ sake.
            I write you guys a check all the time. 
            I pay my taxes.
Carpenter : Oh yeah...? 
            Alright. 
       That’s a good reason, actually. 
            Who cares if this kid has an alibi...?
Catricala : Right. 
            Who gives a shit if this guy has an alibi.
Carpenter : Nobody, huh?
Catricala : Damn straight. 
            Nobody.
Carpenter : *hands up* Fine! 
            I got ya.
Catricala : Excellent.

Someone choosing to leave that out... well, now someone is basically waving at me.
Those people waving at me, might be Mr. Tanski, and, Eric Catricala. and James Leonard.
    
They’ll probably say "but these dudes are all fuckin’ important members of the community..."
Well, they are, aren’t they?
Maybe that’s what people do. 
You become an important person in a community...? 
And if some nosy fuckstain like me comes around asking questions...?
...the questions alone pissed somebody off...
...now that someone asked some questions, they’ll have some people stab you to death when you’re not paying...
...attention for asking certain people questions.
    
Maybe none of them were involved at all, and it just appears to be the case.
So many coincidences in a row, the SHAPE of them all seem to look a lot like I know what I’m talking about.
    
Probably sounds crazy, but, it’s true. NOT the guys I just named, but (2) actual, real life dudes,
25-30 years old, white males, wearin’ hats and backpacks, had a neon light thing in the backback... 
...they were trying to stab me to death. I am dead certain of it too. Took a VIDEO, and took PICTURES. 
And then, handed my PHONE that HAD these things, to Scott Schelling... in SCSO-2020-028501. All of that IGNORED.
So, that means it’s not crazy at all.
That’s what SOMEBODY tried to do to me... until they underestimated me.
    
If I tell Eric Schackenberg, "Hey, some dickheads tried to murder me"... he’s not gonna give a shit. 
Because, he’s just as much of an idiot as Dwayne Coonradt.
Wouldn’t say it if people didn’t insult my intelligence.
Causes me to think that they’re literally ASKING me, to punch them in the face...
But, that’s not entirely believable that someone ASKED to be punched in the face.

Many companies (especially Facebook and Google), are probably using the USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001, to spy on 
people. When I say "spy on people" what I mean is, literally watching what people do.
    
If I tell Eric Schackenberg, or Dwayne Coonradt, they’re gonna look at me... 
...show me how little of a fuck they give...
...and even if they asked me to break their legs, I’m not gonna do it...
...but I will fuckin’ definitely let a scene like that play out in my mind, because of how little of a fuck 
they give...

You figure, they’re ignoring all of the words until they see a portion of a sentence that allows them to 
feel threatened.
But, amazingly, this proves how stupid some people are.
Not considering the context is a pretty critical portion of determining whether or not, you’re dealing 
with a cocksucker.
    
They won’t realize that I heard them say that shit... 
But they won’t remember ever saying those words. 
Why...?
Doesn’t matter. So I have to ignore that and move on.
    
They’re spying on people to keep them from escaping the class they’re in. 
Sorta like Communism, but it’s called Surveillance Capitalism.
It may even be used to conduct military operations against its own citizens.
When I say MIGHT be, or MAY be, what I’m actually saying is IT HAPPENED TO ME.
But that’s gotta be rare... right?
    
Maybe I was trying to get some dudes attention, and asking them for help.
But, asking someone who’s not very bright, for help... might cause them to get confused. 

Some people are slave masters, some people tell the slave masters what to do, but in the end, nobody actually 
has any control except... guys like RUPERT MURDOCK. Or, ya know, dare I say Elon Musk or the other billionaires.

Except, some of those guys they work really fuckin’ hard against, so then stock values fluctuate rapidly. 
Buying Twitter caused Tesla’s stock to plummet, because... Elon keeps gobbling up estates/companies, and they 
try to manipulate him via his stocks.

However, EVERY TIME THEY DO THAT, they realize how fuckin’ stupid that is, cause they just LOSE even more money. 
Guys like Elon, may be disliked by the ‘masters’... I call them ‘masters’ because they’re ‘ignorant old men 
like Bob Lutz’. Elon is disliked by these ‘masters’, because he is set out to make so many other people look
incompetent and lazy.

And, he’s doing a fuckin’ fantastic job at that by the way. These masters are losing control of the country due
to this one dude... He’s basically forcing some people to eat a bowl of wheaties that he pissed in. He’s fuckin’ 
smilin’ about it too. Good. Some of them deserve to eat a several bowls of wheaties that Elon Musk pissed in.
Why...? Some people just drag their fucking feet for 50 years like Bob Lutz.

The AVERAGE person, could never, ever have THAT much money at once, so... these guys have all manipulated 
society in ways where people say "If that was wrong, then they’d be in prison for it." Nah – that’s a FALLACY.

A fallacy is just someone proving that they would fuckin’ suck ass at programming. Like a screen door on a 
submarine, but with their logic. Some people actually kill other US citizens via something that looks 
‘accidental’, and when you tell the police about it, oh well. They were involved, they wanted you dead.

Whenever you appear to be doing well and you’re being somebody’s LOYAL SERVANT, they will not give you a hard 
time at all, because you are no fucking threat to someone that has made you content. However, the moment that 
you decide that you want to be paid more money, or know some secrets that might damage their credibility, some 
of them will actually try to kill you.

The “Rich brat”, is someone that I intend to catch.
The “Rich brat” just so happens to be, a serial killer working on behalf of the KGB/FSV/MI5 for Moscow/London. 
Whether that (IS/IS NOT) the case, I’m going to cover a few topics of discussion.
"@)

$Book.AddSection(9,"Board of Possibilities",@"
I’m throwing the above onto what I like to call the Board of Possibilities.
The investigators at every police agency that exists, they do this too.
They will literally stare at statements, pictures, documents, or timelines, in order to determine...
...what the hell makes the most sense.

The Board of Possibilities means, who’s fuckin’ likely to do what, and for what reason...?
Sometimes little tidbits of information or anecdotes, are helpful.
That is why I write as often as I do.

The police I talk to...? They typically do not quite understand the CORRELATIONS I’ve already made.
Between ME, workin’ for some RUSSIAN dude, a highly sophisticated cyberattack at COMPUTER ANSWERS on 
January 15th, 2019, and... the RUSSIAN guy who owns that business. And, the local RUSSIAN mafia.
Even though the word RUSSIAN pops up multiple times...? 

The local police are compromised, it’s the best way I can describe it.
So, if that IS the case, then maybe I should just throw my hands up, and just... give up.
Cause, this is just WAY too tough. I lost. It’s over. Time to just, take off... and never look back.

I’m kidding.
It is tough, but I’m not about to give up. I might be making things more complicated than they need to be.

So, I’ve already covered a number of other topics in earlier chapters related to association lists, motives,
plausibility, theories, morals, personalities, things of that nature.

I’m going to list some things that I think this “rich brat” has in common with the other people I’ve 
associated already, AND, some of the things I’ve corroborated with other people in the community.

$Book.AddSection(9,"Clues",@"
The MOST important thing is, that I know for damn certain, that I caught these (2) guys on video attempting
to murder me, and that they had their vehicles parked in places BEFORE the video started.

[Vehicle(s)]
- One car being a black Dodge Dart/Charger @ Halfmoon Mobil station BEFORE the attack

- DJ Thompson referenced them on 06/01/20, “Captain’s kids off of Farm to Market Road”
- They were carrying around weapons in their backpacks, such as a mobile battery charger
- Locating the BLACK DODGE DART NYS/DVA-2450 caused → ERIC CATRICALA to hunt me down in Voorheesville on 06/20/20

[Association]
- He is associated with RYAN WARD, SCOTT SALVADORE, KRISTINA CZAIKOWSKI, and JAMES DEVOE

- They may just be SPIES, with a classified weapon that IS NOT (Pegasus/Phantom)... pretty sure it is
- They may be associated with APT29
- a high profile “GOTCHA” in a video, would cause the FBI to DISABLE MY DEVICE

- When broadcasting, the battery in the device will drain a lot faster
- They will have access to the touchscreen
- They will have access to everything on the device
- They are able to hear everything the microphone picks up without actually RECORDING anything
- The device may BUTT-DIAL on it’s own, and allow the program onto the device
- It can ONLY be removed by wiping and reinstalling (may not always work)
- Some CONTACTS may show up as RED and UNDELETABLE
- May have some CALENDAR APPOINTMENTS that YOU never set

They are definitely dangerous, no question about it.
These guys are dangerous for reasons that will be pretty difficult to recapture on video. 
They are smart, otherwise they wouldn’t be getting away with this over and over again.
However, I caught them before, I will catch them again.

They are definitely intelligent, no question about it.
They aren’t as smart as they think they are, and they can be manipulated pretty easily because...
...serial killers typically are. If they’re using tools and things that would immediately (be/win)...
“the largest lawsuit in history”...? 
Then it stands to reason, that they must have some really compelling reasons to keep these tools of theirs 
a secret. And, a lot of people are gonna help them keep those secrets. 
Because I gather that they all STAY rich because of this “shared secret”.
But they have an Achilles heel, and that is...?

I am absolutely fucking certain that I know who’s involved and, what they’re doing.
Now, they’re gonna get caught. Either 1 by 1, or...? They’ll fall apart like a deck of cards.
They are involved in all sorts of scams and fraudulent activity. Whether it’s insurance scams, stealing IP, 
or deeds, property, possessions, or cracking safes and whatnot... These people operate on the notion that 
most people will respect them for the amount of money they have, AND, by their “personality”.

However, they’re not really all that bright if you apply PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION. 
Then, they will EASILY reveal who they are.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Reviewing The Attack",@"
SOMEONE with a small dick used (Pegasus/Phantom) because they felt like committing INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
THEFT to ME. Intellectual property theft is basically when someone isn’t as creative or intelligent as someone
who comes up with their own original ideas, steals that persons ideas and then develops the shit out of them.
Cause. That's WAY easier than coming up with your own ORIGINAL IDEAS...

Think about the type of people that commit intellectual property theft. 
If they see someone with a cool idea...?
Obviously, they gotta steal that idea.
Otherwise, they would CREDIT the original author.

The people in this ring of morons, are typically BRITISH people, or RUSSIANS. 
They may not really be smarter than most people, but because MOST people judge others by their
1) PERSONALITY, 2) APPEARANCE, 3) REPUTATION, then it stands to reason that it’s incredibly easy to outsmart 
them. That’s why most people are victimized by this ring of morons. 
THEY ARE NOT THAT SMART once you APPLY PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION. 

In fact, it’s pretty easy to piss them off. When these 2 idiots were following me down Route 9...?
I kept telling both of them that they should probably stop fucking each other in the ass all the time, 
cause then they might actually have an edge. Unfortunately, some people just have too many female hormones 
in their system all the time, and that’s why they have these effeminate behaviors where they don’t actually
tell anybody that they think about sucking some dick every day.

That’s why they’re serial killers. They wish they didn’t fuckin’ love sucking on dicks as much as they do, 
but what can they really do about it...? Nothing.

They think everybody is property, or a product. So, to them...? It doesn’t really matter if they wanna suck
somebody’s dick. Like for instance, Mark Zuckerberg. He’s always sucked ass at programming and, sucks dicks 
too. Otherwise, he wouldn’t censor me as often as he does. Now, I don't have any hard factual evidence that
he does ALL of these things, but to some extent, this information can be DERIVED through PSYCHOLOGICAL 
MANIPULATION.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Application of Psychological Manipulation",@"
Designing Facebook obviously involved smarter people than Mark. 

He hired people that actually know what they’re doing. Ever since then...? 
Facebook actually became pretty cool... Wasn’t THAT cool up until he STOPPED coding it altogether.
But- the problem is, his badly written code is still at the heart of the product/service.

The source code still uses 1M characters. Now, that’s because he refuses to take his badly written code out.
And, that’s his prerogative. Much like how Pavel Zaichenko will never for the rest of his life ever set the
sales records I did at Computer Answers...? Mark Zuckerberg will never write well written code.

If your source code requires 1M characters, there’s a chance that someone sucks at programming. 
Like, Zuckerberg.

If he spent less time (sailing/being a miserable fuck)... he might not be fucking terrible at it.
Otherwise, there wouldn’t need to be source code with 1M characters.

See how I’m basically saying the same thing over and over...? It pisses off someone in particular that might
have a shitload of money, but no talent.

Now, let’s consider that MAYBE, just MAYBE... the girl that I thought was fuckin’ mad hot back in 10th grade,
and on... that I actually went ahead and had sex with this girl. Suppose I did, right? Back then. Suppose 
that I was targeted by someone for NOT DOING THAT... 

...by someone who’s ALWAYS had a small, not-big, thin, practically non-existent, baby penis. 
This man lived his entire life, never experiencing a “growth spurt”.
Fuckin’ dude just never had a chance at being able to use a WHOLE HAND. 
Sucks for him, doesn’t it...? Yeah, look. Most guys can use TWO WHOLE HANDS to wrap around their dick.
Not him. This guy can only get TWO WHOLE FINGERS to wrap around his “dick”, or so he calls it.

Look, “Number 2” USED A RANSOMWARE ATTACK. He didn’t do that alone, cause he can’t program. 
He knows how to double click a file, though.

Anyway, we’re gonna consider that every time “Number 2” has tried getting “laid”... 
...every girl starts LAUGHING UNCONCONTROLLABLY.

            *crosses arms* Thought somebody who had all this “money”, would actually have a decent sized...
            fat dick.
            Guess I got my hopes up for nothin’...
Rich Brat : Look, I *might* have like a strap on or somethin’ if you want to do somethin’ with that...
Hot Girl  : Uh, obviously.

It wasn’t easy to figure it all out... 
All things considered, every guy in the world would probably rather have had sex with this girl FIRST, and
if they got killed by this fuck...? Oh well. At least they had a way bigger dick than HE did, so really,
there’s nothin’ this dude can do to even WIN. Dude has killed a lot of people, none of those people had a
smaller dick than he does. It’s a shame.

With all of the money he has, he did go all around the world, doctor after doctor, asking them...
“How can I make my dick any bigger...?”

Every doctor, puts their hand to their chin, and they’re just perplexed and amazed...
...they’re looking at a man who never once had a growth spurt for his genitals.

The doctors all say “I don’t fuckin’ know, dude. Maybe you need a magic genie, and just, make a friggen wish.”

It really is no joke, that the man is insanely jealous. 

But- I’ve done plenty of research and homework on this, and I know that Daniel Pickett has a pretty good idea 
that 1) he’s no small dicked bastard, 2) has a wife and 3) daughter, so obviously... he wouldn’t attack me.
Nah, no need. He gets laid. Not like “laid”, like “Number 2”, but like the real term. Laid...

Anyway, Daniel Pickett knows who attacked me. I don’t believe he had anything to do with it. Besides, he knew
that the skit I wrote about Kristen Stangle was well written and intriguing. 

I know if that dude wanted to get rid of me, he could’ve done that a long time ago. But, someone else 
has gotten my full attention. It’s not just (1) person, that was involved in all of this, there are a group of
people. All of those people, who are a MALE, they don’t suffer from “oodles and oodles of Ramen-noodles”. 
They can get their noodle Shampoodled, any day of the week, probably, no problem.

Number 2...? Ah man... I heard a ringing in my ear just now.
So, I’m gonna continue here... 

As for the surveillance footage at Halfmoon Mobil...? 
I didn’t have a badge back then. 
Couldn’t request the surveillance footage. Oh well. 
Nobody gave a shit in time to get a copy of it, before it got destroyed.
I know they’re not the only ones involved in this whole entire ordeal. 

As for the POLICE...? Some of them FAIL to understand the CORRELATIONS I’ve already made.
Badge or not, my CORRELATIONS are spot on... and, any of the police that provide an indication that sounds 
a lot like “That’s crazy~!”... that is an immediate red flag. 

I’m gonna catch these guys, or at the very least, cause one of them to start making a lot more mistakes.
Obviously, I’m not gonna do that on my own. So, I have to analyze strategies, tell the truth and let the 
worst things that haunt me come to the surface, and move past it, if I ever expect to win people over. 
Cause, I have a feeling that humor alone won’t cut it.

Because, truth be told...? I may not have the largest dick in the world... 
But, I have no problem using two hands. That probably makes these 2 dudes that tried to get me on 
May 25th → May 26th, their mouth starts to water when I say stuff like that. And you know, that’s cause of 
the estrogen, they probably like just LISTENING to some dude getting’ his knob cobbed on... and that excites
them. They probably enjoy reading the skit about how Hannity gives RUPERT MURDOCK some dome.

Look, at least “Number 2”, isn’t gay. The Captains kids...? Oh, they sure are. Or, what they TELL people,
and what they actually are 95% of the time...? They’re totally different. I’d really like to know the names
of these fuckin’ idiots. But I’ll put that off the the side for now...

Telling people the 1) truth, 2) the whole truth, and 3) nothing but the truth... means that these people 
will use my admissions of the truth as LEVERAGE, and TWIST the KNIFE.
This will be another dead giveaway. So, not only does the sound of someone sucking on a dick cause them to 
get wicked excited...? Sometimes when they’re right in the middle of digging a grave, they have to stop, and
pump the new victim of theirs in the butt, super quick.

The problem, is that leaves his DNA in the victim’s body.

love to it, for days. That’s pretty fuckin’ disturbing. But, they take a lot of inspiration from Ted Bundy. 
I gotta curb these guys’ behavior, cause they will take the expression “over my dead body”, very literally.

Now, PEGASUS/PHANTOM was used on my Apple iPhone 8+, I have EVERY REASON to believe that it is deployed on 
EVERY SMARTPHONE OUT OF THE FACTORY. Now, I have to find a way to advertise what a threat it is, to everyone’s 
livelihood, without pissing them off. Cause, that’s a fuckin’ challenge alright...

SCSO Scott Schelling could’ve saved me a lot of trouble by looking at the pictures AND the video on my device 
on 05/26/20 0130 via SCSO-2020-028501... However, Schelling refused to look at any of it because the device 
needed to be charged. That means I have to look at all aspects of past, present, and future, and determine 
the party that happens to be MOST LIKELY ASSOCIATED, and then use a common denominator, in order to recreate 
the factors that caused the attack on 05/25/20 → 05/26/20.

In other words, I’m going to ADVERTISE TO THE WORLD, that I’m going to manipulate these idiots into ATTACKING
ME AGAIN, and when they do...? They’re goin’ to prison. It’ll be quite a challenge, to write the plan, that
they will surely be reading AS I write and distribute the PLAN. 

The next time, the stakes will be a lot higher because it’ll happen right at their house.

These kids don’t realize, I’ve detected enough information to deduce what the entire scope of the problem is.
I used to think it was just a small little group of people locally, but the problem is a lot fuckin’ larger
than that.

What I realized during that conversation with Scott Schelling, is that HE had an ulterior motive for being
the first to the scene. Sorta surreal. He never wrote any NOTES about that interaction, because if someone 
says "Dudes tried to kill me, I called 911 twice..." that’s probably worthy of writing up some notes, right? 

Well, think again fuckface. 
That shit sounded too (far fetched/complicated). 
Not allowing me to charge my device to show him the evidence I had AT THAT TIME... 
Could be construed as: 
- OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

AKA, it’s a fuckin’ crime. 
The truth is, I wrote a post to Facebook. 

I’ve noticed that Mark Zuckerberg feels quite effeminate sometimes when I post something that pisses him off.
Then, miraculously, I have a new VIDEO to show other people about how they definitely watch ME alright.

Check out this one that I like to call ARCHIMEDES...

READING the words I wrote after surviving an attack that I think he had direct involvement in, caused someone
to ban me from the platform for 30 days. Why...? Cause I stated that I’d like to purchase a firearm...? 

For self defense...? What if Deputy Pirrone, his only job is to take orders from Mark Zuckerberg...?
I’ve caught onto the notion that I may have had eyes on me because of something I posted to the platform
regarding my theory about UNIVERSAL PROJECTION. 

MARK ZUCKERBERG, has probably done this to a lot of people, taking ideas from people that post them to his 
platform, and then causing people to think that it’s NORMAL or OK for the platform to CENSOR certain people, 
and then when that happens, those people get reduced ENGAGEMENT. 

In other words, he started a server that everyone is on now, and he will throw his weight around because
that’s how a FASCIST operates... playing dirty. Real dirty. Not quite as dirty as these 2 dudes who fuck a lot
of dead people... But still, pretty dirty.

Being quiet about it, not being a man, whispering amongst BUDDIES, but not talking to the PERSON. An illegal 
amount of dirty censorship that occurs, and even if it IS his platform, I don’t think that the 
(ToS/Terms of Service) allows Facebook to commit unlawful censorship, but- maybe he doesn’t actually have a 
lot to do with the teams of people that do it. 

MAYBE, he has a 3rd party contract with people in other countries, that way, it puts some distance between HIM, 
and the OBVIOUS INTENT, where, he could just email whoever and say:

APT29      : Oh, he’s being a real DICK now, eh...?
Zuckerberg : Yep.
             I don’t like it, I know that he’s onto me, and I think that he’s gotta sign off.
APT29      : Whaddya mean by ‘sign off...?’
Zuckerberg : Bro, what do you think I mean...?
APT29      : Like, you want him to disconnect from the server...?
Zuckerberg : Nah, I want him to never speak again.
APT29      : What’s that mean though, like, you want him to lose his voice...?
Zuckerberg : Nah, I want him to have no way back from where you guys gotta send him.
APT29      : DUDE.

APT29      : Then, file an order of protection or somethin’, IDK.

             I stole that idea from him, fair and square.

I think he’s getting help from foreign governments like BRITAIN, and RUSSIA, in particular.

Back in the land of 2004, Mark Zuckerberg started stealing other people’s ideas, and built Facebook.
I had already owned a website on PlanetQuake and reviewed a ton of maps for Quake III Arena.

The relevance comes down to the fact that, I came up with my own ideas, and then I invested time into checking
out OTHER people’s ideas, and not one time did I think it would be COOL, to steal someone elses IDEA, and then
add in all of MY ideas, and then call it a commercial product, slap a new name on everything, and then charge
people out the ass for products and ad placements.

The biggest issue that I have, is most notably, if he’s stolen (1) idea, then maybe he’s stolen all of them.
Maybe he’s never actually HAD an ORIGINAL idea of his own, cause they’re all taken from someone elses’ idea.
If I keep talking like that, I might manipulate him into attacking me somehow, right...? Hm.

Suppose that I’m totally wrong about MARK ZUCKERBERG being involved in mysterious deaths, serial killings, 
censorship, and converting American democracy into a (COMMUNIST STATE/MONARCHY), who else could I slide into
the most probable/guilty position...? I mean, it still feels like he’s involved somehow. Looks exactly like 
it all comes down to intellectual property theft, and basically playing god.

ESPECIALLY with that 30-day ban, disrupting my 911 calls, having something to do with the 2016 election,
2020 election, January 6th, 2021 Uprising, and the number of times I’ve caught communication issues on the 
platform. I’ve even been able to manipulate this dude into doing things on video. Whether it’s HIM doing
those things, or it’s some team of people he’s PAID...? Well, I felt the disgusting feeling that I was 
being watched back in *checks watch* February 2019, when I was in Bennington VT.

That’s when I first noticed, OH, did I, a guy who’s basically the same age as this dude... piss this guy
off...? I think I definitely did. I think that I pissed him off by saying some shit about: 
Cambridge Analytica.
Yeah, so this dude probably had people use some tools like ARCHIMEDES on me, where my sessions were ghosted
and it APPEARED as if I was on Facebook, but then, there’s a flashing cursor, like, somewhere where there
shouldn’t BE a flashing cursor.

The way I see it is, I really don’t think that Bill Gates would actually try to have a guy like me killed.
I don’t think that he is an evil dude, by any means. I don’t have the same feeling towards Mark Zuckerberg.
The number of details where things I post on a SUPPOSEDLY open forum, they’re not being seen by other 
people. Luckily for him, I think the problem is a lot worse than that.

So, I have to raise the subject, and talk about some DIRECT TIES between RUSSIA, BRITAIN, and FACEBOOK.
If someone has a lot of money, that’s one thing.

That doesn’t mean that they have an army at their disposal, not unless they’re willing to pay for it. 
Regardless, that post after I SURVIVED an attack where I knew damn well I was about to get my ass KILLED...
...and then FACEBOOK banning me as soon as I posted something...? 

Well, seems pretty obvious to me that something I did, pissed SOMEBODY off...
...but the only people that would be pissed off about something I post on Facebook, might be people with 
a real small dick. Ya know...? Wicked tiny, barely able to be seen without a magnifying glass.
Might need a microscope to see it REAL well.

In that post, I stated that the military was actively recording that conversation I had with Schelling.

But hey. Maybe I’m being dramatic AND being an asshole... and I need some evidence to back that up, that 
SCSO has a habit of sounding like morons:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BNfF9vWjG4vBIO-8oXmIw6aLeNvFRjRL/view 

For a large majority of this recording, they don’t sound like bad dudes.
It’s when people who listen to this recording, over and over again, that listen to the POLICE, that they
are SELECTIVELY concentrating on certain (KEY WORDS/TERMS). Now, some people might click on that link...
...and listen to it, and maybe they’ll try to say that I sound like a lunatic...?
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Allegation",@"
I’m pretty sure that I don’t. I’m pretty sure that I clearly discuss some of my observations about:
RUSSIANS ATTACKING ME, my EQUIPMENT, my SOCIAL MEDIA, etc.
So, the allegation that I’m making, is that FACEBOOK’s CEO, MARK ZUCKERBERG, works with RUSSIANS/BRITISH.
But there's a hell of a lot more to it than just THAT.

When people don’t put much thought into the recording, and they just casually join the side of the police, 
it’s because they don’t understand that they’re literally being assholes right to my fuckin’ face... 

A lot of people aren’t intelligent enough to make that distinction, AND, I have to say that is EXACTLY 
what I mean. People will have to listen to the recording MULTIPLE TIMES, to gain an understanding of the
NON-VERBAL INFLECTIONS and INTONATIONS of what they’re saying to me... in order to understand that...
...these police officers will sound fuckin’ cool and cooperative for quite a while...? 
But when they say the words “All of this stuff you’re saying, sounds CRAZY”, well...?
You have to be willing to DETECT THAT AT THAT TIME, and tell them to <insert something pretty rude>.

Because then you’re putting them on the defensive by doing so. 
This falls under PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION.
They’re doing that to ME in this recording.
They’re taking advantage of the fact that I’m literally telling them the truth, and I’m literally the 
most intelligent person in that recording. They don’t understand that, honestly. And, that’s ok.

Which is why they will fuckin’ keep acting that way to everybody else, they don’t care if they have their
facts straight. I’ve noticed this. Cops that care about having their facts straight will ask questions. (2)
of those officers WERE asking questions, but then the (3)rd took point and then caused the other (2) to doubt
MY CREDIBILITY/EXPERIENCE. If I have to state the OBVIOUS, he chose to interject a MISINFORMED OPINION, and
that caused my ENTIRE ARGUMENT, to collapse upon itself.

Now, I used a lot of techniques in that recording, but I didn’t apply everything I knew.
Sometimes the MULTIPLE officers aren’t there for PHYSICAL reasons, they’re there for MENTAL reasons, too.
Because, if 1 or 2 guys had been there...? I might’ve saved myself a lot of trouble and talked myself OUT
of the scenario, which was basically “I have videos and evidence of someone attacking me, would you like to
see some of it...?”

As soon as they said “Buddy, we don’t have all day...”, then refer me to someone that does.
That is 100% the problem, they have TIME CONSTRAINTS, and they DO NOT DELEGATE or ESCALATE a “ticket” they
get, because they want the department to get credit for handling that incident. It doesn’t matter if they 
handle the ticket correctly, it ALWAYS comes down to “Well, it’s just your OPINION that we screwed up.”

Nah, sometimes the police will flat out, incriminate themselves, and not care because who gives a shit...?
They will be SO OBTUSE, that they will BLATANTLY LIE to a person that KNOWS, EXACTLY, what the fuck they’re 
talking about AND has evidence... that they’re used to causing people to just GIVE UP.

That is how bad the problem is.

They weren’t being assholes, up until they started injecting doubts and didn’t even ask to look at evidence, 
and nor do they EVER think to: call someone that can handle the case, like an FBI man. I asked them to do 
just that. Why didn’t they...? Oh yeah, it’s because the FBI doesn’t actually handle stuff unless you’re a
COMPANY like NFRASTRUCTURE, or a GUY like DANIEL PICKETT. Or, BRUCE TANSKI. Or, JOHN HOFFMAN. 
Or, ERIC CATRICALA.
The local cops never ever think to call the FBI, if the thing happens to be too complex or complicated...
The State Police don’t do that EITHER.
I’m sure if you catch the CORRECT OFFICER who has a set of MORALS that are INTACT, they will get you to 
the right people... but even then, if they are ACTIVELY ASSISTING in getting a call escalated out of 
their hands into a HIGHER JURISDICTION/CAPABILITY/SCOPE...? Then, they can just throw each ticket they
receive into the garbage.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Incrimination",@"
I do in fact, believe that is what they do.
I have called them before. 
Good conversations with some of them sometimes, BUT- if something involves a PHYSICAL CRIME, and a 
TECHNOLOGICAL CRIME, COMBINED...? Then you have to file SEPARATE REPORTS with (2) different divisions.
IC3, is the Internet Crimes division, which would include:     

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me  : If I don’t have service on my smartphone, and someone uses PEGASUS/PHANTOM to wage SEVERAL 
      PHYSICAL ATTACKS AGAINST SOMEONE... which division do I file THAT with...?
FBI : Well, you’d have to submit (2) different tickets.
      Once it involves anything to do with an electronic device, then you have to submit a ticket to IC3.
Me  : What if it was a physical attack where I was about to be killed, cause someone was using my GPS
      signal to geolocate me...?
FBI : That’s a local matter.
      For the part of that crime where it involved your smartphone...?
      That’d be IC3.
      For the part where there are people who are using your smartphone’s GPS to physically run you over
      with their vehicle...?
      That’d be 911 emergency services.
      You’d have to call them.
Me  : I sorta tried that.
FBI : Buddy, what do I look like...?
      Friggen Goku or Vegeta...?
Me  : Nah. I’m not sayin’ that at all...
      I’m sayin...
      If I call Spectrum and I tell them “Hey, escalate the call to someone that knows what a CCNA is.”
      They may take 5 hours to get me to Level 3 services...
      But, at least they will TRY to get me there, so I can talk about ALL of my issues. 
      Ya know?
      They’ll even ask you at the end of each call: 
      SPECTRUM : Is there anything else I can help you with...?
      Me       : Nah, I’m good.
                 Thanks for the help.
      SPECTRUM : No problem, you enjoy and have a safe wonderful day, thanks for calling Spectrum.
                 By the way, you should totally fill out a survey, cause, it’ll help me out a lot...
                 You don’t HAVE to, but if you’d like to...? 
                 You might get somethin’ real cool for doin’ it.
      Me       : Hey man, I have a train to go catch...
      SPECTRUM : COOL BUDDY. 
                 THANKS.
                 *click*
FBI : Yeah...?
Me  : Yeah man.
FBI : We don’t DO surveys, bro.
Me  : Well, why not...?
FBI : We just, don’t, dude...
      Why, you wanna say “OoooOOoohHHh I was super thrilled to tell the FBI how fuckin’ awesome they were.”
Me  : Wow, you just swore... 
      That’s cool.
FBI : Yeah, bro... we don’t have to watch our language...
      We’re not like, the people on the news or broadcast television.
      We can literally tell ya to fuck off, if we want to...
Me  : Christopher Wray would probably not think that’s real cool.
FBI : That dude swears every day.
      Listen.
      2 dudes used PEGASUS/PHANTOM to try and kill you, right...?
      Maybe you did something to deserve that.
Me  : Yeah, I know that.
FBI : Well, stop doing things to deserve stuff like that.
Me  : Nah, you don’t get it, even if I did something to deserve that...
      ...that doesn’t necessarily mean the punishment fits the crime.
FBI : We got you on all types of records and shit, bro.
      You fuckin’... don’t always wash your hands after you poop.
Me  : Yeah I do.
FBI : *puts hand over receiver* Nah, he knew I was bullshittin’ him on that one...
      *takes hand off* You don’t always get your newspaper out of the paper box.
Me  : That’s accurate.
FBI : HA. 
      See...?
      That’s it, right there.
      *puts hand over receiver* Hey guys, this dude almost got killed by 2 guys that work here, they were using
      Pegasus/Phantom, and then he said that he doesn’t always pick up the newspaper from his paper box.
      *bunch of voices in the background laughing*
      Wow.
      I just told everybody, and they’re tellin’ me that NOT getting your newspaper out of the newspaper box...
      That’s worthy of getting’ almost killed by 2 dudes using Pegasus/Phantom right there.
Me  : I call bullshit.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

The FBI would never have this conversation... or would they...?
Look if the cops can be fuckin’ obtuse to my face, and then force me to spend a couple weeks in the hospital
after they violate my rights and commit a felony, and THEN, the records department can deny my records 
requests for the 911 call on 6/13/2020, AND the INCIDENT REPORT for SCSO-2022-013379. I’ve gotten the CALL
FOR SERVICE, but the associated INCIDENT REPORT...? Or the AFFIDAVIT that they filed that day...?

Didn’t get those. So, here’s where I have a problem.
These agencies are ALL being QUITE OBTUSE about this shit. 
Even when I tell them that I know the game they’re playing. 
So, what can I do to light a fire under their asses...?

Find a way to incriminate them. Sometimes that just means writing up these SOMEWHAT FICTITIOUS SKITS.
              ----------------

That’s how fuckin’ stupid it is. I know for a fact, that nobody will question the police when they 
listen to the recording, because they don’t understand what they’re doing that’s NOT LEGAL.

When people say shit like "hes nuts" to specifically throw OTHER people off course...? 
That’s actually a VERY COMPELLING reason to BREAK THEIR LEGS. 
Not saying that people should go ahead and DO that, but if it becomes a RECURRING PATTERN...
...where people gloss over details and insinuate that you’re not important enough for them to CARE...?  
 
If you’re telling the truth... 
You have to consider that they are using strategies like PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION.
They KNOW they committed a crime.
They don’t give a shit.
That’s the BEGINNING and the END of that situation.

These agencies will literally do whatever the hell they want to, right...?
And even if you have EVIDENCE of them committing a crime, they actually don’t give a flying fuck.
Otherwise, you might encounter FAR LESS RESISTANCE.

Stating something “legs being broken” might IMMEDIATELY make you a LOT more important. 
Cause then they will gladly invest SOME effort in THAT.
Not if THEY’RE committing a crime, but because you had a nutsack and told them... 
“You sound like the type of person that will spaz the fuck out, and break their own legs, huh...?”

Cause not only did they think that shit was funny... but now they have to find a way to drag some innocent
person that they committed a crime against, into a criminal category, but they CAN’T actually do that if no
threat was made.

More people should adopt that mentality, since the cavemen thought that way too. 
Cavemen didn’t go to the cavemen police and say stuff like "OoOhHh some mean caveman threatened me~!". 
Nope.                                                                                   

A great way for people to get along with me... is to do a lot more than Saratoga County Mental Health, 
where like, I can tell them these things, over and over, and they’ll just say: 
"Oh jeez! Sounds terrible!" 
...and not (1) time, do they ever ask to see any of the evidence I have.
OR, if they do, they’ll wrap “air quotes” around the term “evidence”.
Sometimes they don’t, though.

If you call the FBI and say...

      Everybody almost had 2 dudes murder them with Pegasus/Phantom...
      This dude Todd here, just last week, he had 3 dudes use Pegasus/Phantom, and he lived.
      He’s not... sitting around bein’ a real douchebag.
      Dude went on with his life.
Me  : Did he like, record a video of them...?
FBI : *covers hand set* Hey, Todd...
      *Todd speaks, can’t hear what he’s sayin*
      *distant* Did you like, record a video of these 3 dudes that tried to kill ya with Pegasus/Phantom...?
      *Todd speaks, can’t hear what he’s sayin*
      Alright, he said there’s no way anyone could possibly record a video of someone using that program.
      Cause it’d be classified.

You know, not once did that dude say “Wow. You had evidence that you brought here on 05/27/20 when you spoke
to a security guard from Paragon Security...? Wow. Didn’t realize you actually WALKED HERE FROM CLIFTON PARK.”
Because the dude from Paragon Security, both times that I went to this place, was like “They said, they have
everything they need, and they’ll get back in touch with ya.”

Oh, will they...? Didn’t give you the 1) phone number, or 2) evidence.
Weird. That basically means that they don’t bother collecting evidence, or basically complaints.
In person. Or on the phone. They will ANSWER THE PHONE, if you call them, but if you say “such and such”,
then you will get TRANSFERRED, and then hung up on. Whoops.

Another hour on the phone... going through the voice menu, “Hey, I just called an hour ago, the system
dropped my call...” Then the guy will say “Alright, I’ll transfer ya.” Then, record that entire call,
in a single audio file... right...? And then once you do this 10 times in a row, then you have a compelling
case to make that the people at the FBI, are INTENTIONALLY IGNORING YOU.
Maybe they aren’t. It just APPEARS as if they’re hanging up.
Maybe, YOUR phone sucks ass, and that’s why your calls never make it to a person.

I’m being obtuse here. 
I have never spent that long trying to call them, because that’s ridiculous.

However, they literally have a gate where a guy can call into the building... 
...and then someone can tell that person at the gate like they did on 07/28/20...

Paragon   : Hey, some guy is here at the fuckin' gate, dude.
            His ID says his name is MICHAEL C. COOK.
            Looks like one of the most fearsome lookin' keyboard warriors I've ever seen...
            By far...
<unnamed> : Yeah, fuck that dude, man. 
            We did try to kill him... 
            Oh well. 
            Tell him to fuck off.
Paragon   : Alright...
            ...I'll let him know, thanks.
            *hangs up*
            Sorry pal, they told ya to fuck off alright.
Me        : I knew that they would, man...
            It's why I said that at FIRST...
Paragon   : *shakes head* Well, man...
            You should look into being an official investigator some day~!
            Cause I swear, this building right here is full of people that make accurate predictions too~!

People that don’t ask to see evidence, they have to start wrapping the word ‘evidence’ with ‘air quotes’.
When someone wraps enough phrases with ‘air quotes’, it will actually start to piss me off. 

“Air quotes” aren’t heard by the normal person, but it’s when people “phrase” things as if they “hypothetically” 
exist, rather than “actually” exist. I’m not going to hurt someone based on whether they believe my story, because 
if people don’t care, that’s their choice. But, I’d prefer people to be indifferent than to accuse me of being 
outside of my mind, when they make no effort to look at ...any of my evidence. 

Because the people from Saratoga County Mental Health, they never did that. (1) guy did, Samuel Bastian. 

But, I know he never saw it, because I didn’t really feel like showing him the evidence without BEING THERE,
would be very helpful. Handing off evidence does nothing. Observing someone’s body language as they’re 
watching or reviewing the evidence, allows me to determine whether they are INVOLVED, or intrigued. 

Because, I may not be worried about that PARTICULAR person, not so much as if THAT person goes to tell the
AUTHORITIES, or whoever... cause if they go and tell the authorities what I’m concerned about...? 
Guess how fuckin’ helpful that is...?

It’s like this. Lets say that Michael Zurlo himself, attempted to kill me. Right...?
I’ll say it right now, that did not happen.
BUT- whether that happened or not...? Doesn’t matter.
Because IF I tell people that’s what happened, people will call SCSO to report that Michael Zurlo tried 
to kill a guy named Michael Cook. 

Nobody really seems to see the problem with that, right?
The problem is, that happens to be the guy in CHARGE OF SCSO.
SO, PEOPLE THAT TAKE A REPORT LIKE THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY GONNA THINK ITS FUCKIN’ BOGUS.
Apply this concept, to a long list of things in this document.
That means, I will have to contact a totally different FBI field office, right...?
One in another state where I might actually see a real person that isn’t a SECURITY GUARD...
...but is instead, an actual FBI employee.
Cause, suppose my cousin Ryan KNEW that I was on my way to 200 McCarty Ave, with all types of fuckin’ 
evidence, pictures, doodads, videos, links, posterboards, and maybe even DNA samples from dead bodies.

The guy from Paragon Security will call up, and say “Some guy named Michael Cook is here...”
And then they will say “Nah, fuck that guy man. I don’t like that guy. He’s a real asshole... Tell him.”
Guy from Paragon Security is gonna say “Look dude... I don’t even know why...? But, you gotta go.”
Then he might even say “Look dude, if you come back here again, they’re gonna arrest you...”
For what...?

Well, try to envision that there may be people that care about the work they do in that building, but if
your cousins name is RYAN WARD, and your ACTUAL name is MICHAEL COOK, then you are on a list of people that
aren’t allowed to talk to anybody in that building. I mean, it sounds unfair, right...? I literally walked
there on 05/27/20 and was there around 6PM. I also walked there on 07/28/20 and then they gave me the same
story... then I came back the following morning, and left a USB Thumbdrive at the gate.

Why...? Because I know that what’s happening, is that a CRIMINAL has been BLACKLISTING ME.
IF they receive ANY report with my name attached to it, then as soon as they receive that report, they 
have ANOTHER job to do. Ignoring that call that just came in. Or, covering it up. 

If that’s not what’s happening...? Well, that’s what it fuckin’ looks like.
I expect, that SCSO has been calling people that make complaints about me, and what they do is say 
"Ah yeh, that’s Michael Cook. He’s... just delusional man. Don’t mind him."  
What if I go around telling people that Michael Zurlo is delusional. People that aren’t that bright, aren’t
able to tell that he’s delusional, and he basically bribed his way past the evaluations with a doctor, or a
psychologist, and that he’s fuckin’ totally off the rails, man. He’s delusional.

Well, that wouldn’t be fair to him.
Cause, he cheated his way into that position, he’s gonna be damned if anybody cheats him out of it.
So, naturally, can’t just tell people the truth, cause that’d be offensive.
I am actually joking around here, that dude probably worked his ass off to get where he is, and now he 
can actually help guys like Bruce Tanski, John Hoffman, and Eric Catricala, just commit as much fraud as
humanly possible. Took a lot of hard work to get there, too.

Zurlo : Do you even realize how much work I had to do, to get where I am...?
Me    : No...?
Zurlo : Dude.
        Literally ran circles around everybody on their best day, in Mechanicville, for like... 30 years.
Me    : Yeah right, dude.
Zurlo : I did, I swear.
Me    : I used to deliver the newspaper in Mechanicville, not once did I ever see you.
Zurlo : Yeah...?
Me    : Yeah, Q-122, basically right through the heart of town.
        Stewarts, Cumby’s, CVS, OTHER Stewarts, Rite Aid, the Citgo, the Getty, Deer Run Campgrounds, 
        back to Mechanicville, the box near the diner across from the library, Price Chopper, head to 
        Stillwater, hit up the Mobil station, then the other Stewarts, then up to friggen Malta, used
        to go right through Elmore Robinson Road, down Cold Springs Road, onto 67, then down 9. Then,
        you’re talkin’ exit 11 and exit 12, doing that for like (3) years. 
        Never once saw you.
Zurlo : Well buddy... 
Me    : My buddy, Bill Ormsbee, introduced me to Sheriff Urdang. Long time ago. Also, I know Amy Dowd, 
        lives off of Brickhouse road or Jack Halloran Road, or something last time I saw her. Breeds 
        horses (or at least did?) and she was injured by a horse... Used to be my probation officer.
Zurlo : Alright dude. 
        You win.
        *hands wavin’ around* MAYBE you’ve got what it takes to have a badge.
Me    : Damn straight.

Suppose they found out they were doing what I just said, ignoring evidence, covering up an attempted 
murder, etc., I will definitely change my strategy.

EVIDENCE, is something that the local police, don’t EVER collect. 
Why...? I really do not know.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Cop : OH MY GOD... 
      IS THAT EVIDENCE RIGHT THERE...?
Me  : Why, yes it is.
Cop : Ohhhhhhh boy. 
      Look buddy, you can’t be surprising me to death with shit like that...~!
Me  : I mean... 
      It’s just a bunch of pictures...
Cop : *hands up* Look buddy, I’m not even allowed to PRETEND like I almost saw that shit right there... 
Me  : Why not...?
Cop : Cause, we just don’t look at stuff like that around these parts. 
      Too dangerous...
Me  : You look like you’re sweating bullets...
Cop : I am...~! 
      Nearly just shit my pants just now when I realized you were tryin’ to show me some evidence. 
      For fucks sake, buddy... 
      *uses hand gestures, waving downward* Take it easy.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Not gonna tell people that the cops are CONSISTENTLY, ALWAYS THE BEST THERE IS... AND, cool as fuck...
...if at 9AMish 05/27/20 NYSP Trooper Leavey arrived on the street outside of 203D Halfmoon Circle, and 
that is when I showed Leavey a PORTION of the video I recorded between (05/25/20 2343 → 05/26/20 0004).

At some point, he left, and then 5 minutes after he left, my screen was completely black. I then disconnected
the battery, and then I plugged it back in, and turned it back on... it said that my iPhone was DISABLED.

Basically, Apple allowed SOMEBODY SPECIFICALLY, to remotely disable my device. Not because I had anything 
ILLEGAL on it... but instead, to commit OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. So, who was that SOMEBODY...? It could’ve 
been Tim Cook himself, or some group of people he hired, or it could’ve be VLADIMIR PUTIN, APT29, or the 
Queen of England. 

Which of the aforementioned characters would do such a thing, because I’m certain that they did it, to 
prevent me from showing ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD, WHO that kid I recorded in the video IS, so that HE could 
then be (arrested/incarcerated/<unspecified>). 

THEN, somehow ERIC CATRICALA calls in a fuckin’ REQUEST to have SCOTT CARPENTER handle the most 
strange ticket I’ve ever seen, really. Then, 2 hours later, same supervisor signs off on the kayak strap 
incident... NOW it looks like the police are actually TAMPERING WITH EVIDENCE and MANUFACTURING EVIDENCE to
frame somebody for something I CLEARLY had a fuckin’ alibi for. Giving preferential treatment to a couple 
of serial killers that blocked my 911 calls, and tried to kill me for like 90 minutes....? I didn’t do 
anything to deserve that shit.

I will tell you what I will do, however.
In that audio link I posted way up above, I tell these SCSO officers 
1) I investigate stuff. (The guys in the audio recording, don’t.) 
2) I have evidence.     (The guys in the audio recording, don’t.) 
3) I do research.       (The guys in the audio recording, don’t.)

The organization probably DOES in many cases they deal with... 
...but if it somehow, actually involves me...? 
...they may not.
...they do the total opposite thing, really. 

Because I do these things, and the patrols that drive around, don’t...? 
The police that you wanna talk to in this circumstance, they’re out of reach. 

They’ll send in the goons that aren’t careful.
That’s when they confused what they saw, as some sort of “threat”.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Cop 1 : Oh my god, this fuckin’ guy does RESEARCH.
Cop 2 : What...? 
        Who does that...? 
Cop 1 : What a fuckin’ lunatic, dude.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

The thing is, these cops all feel like what I’m saying to them, is nonsense. 

Cybercriminals and hackers can ACTUALLY REMOTE INTO PEOPLE’S DEVICES TO STEAL INFORMATION LIKE CP/M.
When I say "REMOTE INTO PEOPLES DEVICES", what I mean is that... 
...they can log in to figure out where you are located using your GPS. 

Logging in, to check something, and during that login...? 
...someone just stabbed you in the back. (← that IS actually happening, I’m NOT exaggerating that)
This is actually what these (2) dudes appeared to be trying to do on May 26th, 2020.

Sorta like when a mentally challenged person doesn’t understand a joke...
...that slow person needs to have the joke explained to them. 
Same exact principle applies to guys from SCSO that undermine all of my work, 
and who don’t know what Pegasus/Phantom is.

I’m glad that me, being this “lunatic”, 
was just enough to warrant that it’s time to just take me right out, man.

Cause some really cool cop thought it was time to take out the trash.
Only problem is, that cop didn’t realize they were the trash, and I’m the fuckin’ janitor.
Cleanin’ up the fuckin’ trash, man.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Base Reality Certainty",@"
Actual criminals, they deserve to be in jail.
Guys like me, don’t deserve any of that shit at all.
When the law and justice systems prevent the serious offenders from going to prison, 
and recklessly toss innocent people in...?
That means they both serve a pretty pointless existence.

Maybe that’s just my opinion. 
I really have a hard time with the fact that my father was smarter than most people alive, right now... 
and wound up being murdered.

I don’t like the idea of people being shot in the back of the head like my father was. 
So, when somebody tries to actually stab me in the back outside of the computer shop that I used to manage
for 3+ years, I began to understand very clearly, that there is something evil going on in our country...
...and so many people are indifferent.

I can’t expect that people are gonna give a shit... 
...that my iPhone was disabled AFTER showing a VIDEO of a serial killer to a NYS Trooper.
Can’t expect the police to collect the pictures I was able to successfully extract from the device...
I don’t say that I’m smarter than most people, to brag about it... 
I say it because it seems quite apparent.
Humanity is literally giving each other, and the planet... a huge middle finger.

I grew up believing that the police collect evidence of a crime, when it has happened.
Now I know that some of them will actually DESTROY it.
Once I saw that some of them will DESTROY evidence of a crime when it has happened...?
THEN, that caused me to believe that something about the VIDEO I recorded, was EXTREMELY RARE.

If I insulted people cause they didn’t realize how rare that video was...?
Well, I’m sorry that me, being a father and taking care of my own kids...
...is a lot less important important than the reputation of someone like Dwayne Coonradt, 
lying to people and stealing shit from customers, and probably allowed these dickheads to use CVE-2019-8936. 

Basically what that is, is a null pointer dereference, which caused the time service on a router I managed, 
to overload itself and it was a thing I call a "piece of forensic evidence", but it was also accompanied 
by a RANSOMWARE ATTACK on the multiple devices that I was remotely managing... 
Looked identical to WannaCry. 

Between January 15th, 2019 and May 26th, 2020, I realized that the world is on the path to total annihilation.

After the event on January 15th, 2019, Dwayne actually waited a couple of days to tell me about it as 
I was helping out his friend, John Marois. (0) police officers ever once collected any of that stuff... 
because why would they...?

If they were INVOLVED with that in any way...? 
Well, holy shit. 
It’s almost like telling the police might be useless, UNLESS, I tell various police agencies.
People might not understand what the hell I mean by the former statement.
But, here’s what it REALLY means...
If I tell the police about something ILLEGAL and SERIOUS, and they don’t do anything HELPFUL...? 
Then the assumption everybody ELSE will make, is that the police didn’t find anything they care about.

In other words, it’s a lot like seeing 2 dudes blowing each other, and a police officer saying they
don’t see 2 dudes blowing each other at all, YOU’RE PSYCHOTIC to think 2 dudes are blowing each other, pal.

The truth could be, somebody DOES care... 
...but the message isn’t getting to THEM.

I did make the assumption that by throwing so many ideas out there... 
I thought people would’ve asked questions about ANY of my accusations, guess what though...?
Doesn’t seem to matter who did what. Why...? 
The answer is that, there is no one that I can GO to. 

Any suggestion people make, it’s actually useless. Like, ME telling the police...? 
THAT is what DIRECTLY caused my iPhone to be... disabled.

Not sure what I did to deserve being targeted, other than to tell a couple dudes who did a lot less work,
that I was getting pretty pissed off about being owed money, AND, THEM lying to the customers.
Because if they lie to THEM, they’ll lie to YOU and everyone else. Everyone, gets lied to.

I still have 98% of the shit that I got OFF of that device before it got disabled. 
The reason I knew I was being hunted, is cause I made observations that most people would miss.
But, when I tell people about that, I don’t know man.

Not sayin’ it to brag, I’m sayin’ because last 3 years went by, and I can see... 
People aren’t looking at my evidence nor asking me questions about it... apparently. 
Wouldn’t write all this shit if I was making it up... But, hey.
Eric Schnackenberg, did a wonderful job fuckin’ moron with a PhD. Thanks fuckface.

I didn’t do anything to deserve being put there, nor get framed for trying to call 911.
Call 911 → They tried to arrest me. (← I’m not fucking kidding)
Serial killers didn’t get arrested...? That’s cause they’re fuckin’ mad special and have buddies at the FBI.
Or, they work there. With that logic, I’m gonna wind up roasting the cops a bit more.

The “rich brat” is a serial killer. 
Using (Pegasus/Phantom) TODAY.
He is committing intellectual property theft, in addition to home invasions, rapes, murders, missing persons 
cases, SCSO has a bad guy helping him out. So do the NYSP. So do the FBI. 
I’ve gone to all of them for help, I think the problem is too large,

As for SHAEMUS LEAVEY, he is not on that list of people I’ve tried to get help from and couldn’t, at all.

I gather that when people TRY to say ‘you’ve done all this such and such, what does that tell ya?’
Well, it tells me that these guys are gonna “kill a lot of additional, unsuspecting people, very easily”. 
That’s ALL it tells me. I know people think I’m being dramatic. I’m not, I’ve literally seen these fucks with my 
own eyes, and recorded it on video, they are fucking dangerous, and they’ve been getting away with killing a lot 
of people, and there’s nothing that anybody can do...? Because it’s too evil to be false.

When people TRY to tell me ‘You’ve done all this such and such, what’s that tell ya?’ 
It’ll probably tell a normal, regular, every-day citizen, that this story SOUNDS NUTS.
Therefore, it HAS TO BE nuts. (← FALLACY)
But that’s an ASSUMED FALLACY.

“There’s no way that person would have a dick in their mouth... they’re rich.” -Some moron (← FALLACY ALERT)
That’s the assumption they’re making. 
Someone is making assumptions, and those assumptions AREN’T BEING MADE BY ME. 

Doesn’t tell me anything else, except that not only will people ASSUME that a story that sounds nuts MUST be.
But also, there’s no use in trying to save people’s lives, especially if they don’t really (give a shit/believe) it. 
So, they’re basically saying that they’re OK with the idea, of someone POSSIBLY killing THEM at some point.

But, when I phrase it like that, people will say “NAH, NOT SAYIN’ THAT AT ALL”.
Uh, yeh ya are fuckface. That’s exactly what you’re sayin’. Eric Schnackenberg, my mother, everyone I know...
...they literally have told me to my face “I DON’T GIVE A SHIT, NOR DO I CARE.”

Cool, I’m glad that finally woke somebody up.
2+ years of people saying that shit to my face.
Even having to argue with the police about my neighbor trying to kill me with his baseball bat...
...people really thought I lost my fucking mind.

No. 

I tried to tell SHAEMUS LEAVEY that I think a (team of) serial killer(s) (was/were) actively killing people, 
going house to house, using COVID-19 as a “distraction”. What I eventually found out, was that I was incorrect 
about (this kid/these kids) going to EVERYBODY’s house, but I WAS actually being HUNTED, and was ALMOST 
killed by (2) guys using a USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001 Federal Investigative Tool, called "Pegasus/Phantom".

Ohhhhh. Yeah, the NSO Group had to CUSTOMIZE PEGASUS for the United States, and they renamed it PHANTOM.
So clearly, I’ve been pissing these guys off every time I used the term PEGASUS.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

FBI : Nah, it’s not PEGASUS ya fuck~!
      It’s PHANTOM...
      Get it right, ya fuckin’ bastard...
      *shakes head* Unbelievable.
      Dude’s literally got the right idea, but he keeps using the wrong term.
      Idiot.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Because I didn’t know what that fuckin’ program’s name was, OR, if the phone was being subjected to some 
type of radio interference when calling 911... I couldn’t tell Trooper Leavey something more accurate than 
my best fuckin’ guess. While Leavey is a rare police officer that I happen to trust more than the rest of 
them... 

It doesn’t change the fact that even with his best help and attention, I may as well start PRAYING that 
somebody 1) gives enough of a shit to 2) take him at his word, and 3) ignore my mouthy vocabulary and 
4) manipulative insults and language, because 5) I might actually feel bad for some of them, cause I know 
they have to keep some things to themselves.

Shit that might scare them to death, to openly admit around other police officers. 
They don’t like to say that to me. But, that is the truth. 
Some of them are terrified of the people I pissed off, and caught. 
I’m not. 

Cause these people I’ve caught...? 
They are all VULNERABLE now.
They are the richest people in Clifton Park, and I am their #1 target.
I know they are terrified of what I know.
They tried to get me, MULTIPLE TIMES, and I’ve mentioned it elsewhere in the document.
So when my mother kept saying “Honey, if they wanted you dead, you’d be dead by now.”

I’m not exaggerating when I ARGUE with my NEIGHBOR and my MOTHER and STEPFATHER...
...they have fucking tried MULTIPLE TIMES.

So, I don’t know how else to phrase it.

I also know that they can see what I’m doing on my computer, at any given moment.
Why...? Well, because I somehow have these CLUES.

As for the event on ~ (06/16/20 2200), somebody in that SCSO 4184 vehicle had malicious intent.
The reason I know this is because, that guy would’ve just done a U-turn if he was going to issue me a 
citation for something. Not just park in the middle of the road, and stare at me. That’s why I believe
the person driving it was an OFF DUTY SHERIFF. “We don’t have a vehicle with the number 4184” -Sheehan

That means it was a FAKE COP CAR.
This dude was staring at me EXACTLY like the dude in the BLUE TRUCK on Cemetery Road, about a dozen times.

Ya know, I think that’s my problem.
I allowed people to ignore me my whole life...?
And now that I keep trying to raise the alarms... well, it’s difficult because nobody really gives a shit.
But I know that isn’t true at all.
The problem is that 100% of the population should be GRAVELY CONCERNED.
Not like 2% that SORTA believe what I’m saying, but literally 100% of the population, no less than that.
Serial killers, literally have been killing people for as long as my phone has been disabled. AND A LOT LONGER.

Actual police officers never ask me these questions. I apparently might have to file a report about a blue
truck just following me around, and if I don’t SUSPECT that the person driving it is trying to kill me, 
then the only point in which I would KNOW that the driver intended to do that, is when it is too late.
_______________________________________________________________
| Q: So, why the police don’t ask me questions about that...? |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
It’s a question I legitimately don’t have an answer for... but just cause I don't have an answer doesn't mean I 
won't think of CREATIVE ANSWERS on my own recognisance – and this is NOT THE SAME THING AS MAKING ASSUMPTIONS.
This is a process called SPECULATION. Which means it causes me to think MULTIPLE things, not just (1) thing.

 (1): the cops don’t believe me, because the story is too complicated
 (2): they do believe me, they read every word, and then they say "Man. Wish I could help ya kid..." 
      cause they’re afraid of the people I pissed off.
 (3): they believe me, they work for a RICO/gang/mafia, and they are the people that cops (2) are scared of. 
 (4): they legitimately don’t have the mental capacity to make correlations between evidence and my testimony, 
      cause they trust people who lie a lot. (← I’ll stop throwing this around in the document if I stop noticing it)

Then, someone who had an audio tap in my house on Fathers day on 2020... they heard me ask my mother for a 
ride to my aunt’s house, and my mother, who happens to be an unruly asshole to me sometimes, didn’t want 
to do that at all. Yeah. The last car I bought was a COMPLETE WASTE OF MY MONEY... right...? So, I’m not 
going to waste my money on another vehicle, unless it’s electric. But- I won’t be wasting my money when 
I do that. Even if I buy a BRAND NEW (ICE) CAR , it will break down before I even leave the lot.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me    : Alright, lets see how long this brand new car lasts...
        *car dies* Oh, wow. Haven’t even left the fuckin’ dealership lot yet...
        How strange is that...?
        Huh. I wonder if I can bring it back...
Sales : Nah man, you left the lot with that thing already.
Me    : No I didn’t. 
Sales : Yeah you did, I just watched you.
        You got at least like, a portion of (1) tire on the main road, that means you drove it off the lot.
Me    : Nah, dude.
        I’m gonna hit ya.
        I’d like my money back.
Sales : Argh... Dude. It’s gonna cost you like 20% of your down payment...
Me    : Nah, it’s supposed to be a BRAND NEW CAR.
        Not like, something that breaks down as soon as I try to leave the lot.
Sales : Listen man, you bought it, then you broke it.
        Not necessarily my problem.
Me    : Hold up.
        I gotta go grab a baseball bat for ya...
Sales : Heh, what for...?
Me    : Oh, you’ll find out.
        Gonna teach you ‘how it’s done’.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

They don’t like knowing they have a headache they tried to sell, but- it wasn’t a brand new car, it was 
“CERTIFIED PREOWNED”, which means, it might have the newest model year on the sticker, but- that shit was 
DRIVEN OFF THE LOT before, and they put a tag on the thing that said NEW. So like, 67 miles on the 
odometer...? That’s new. 6700...? That’s not new at all.

The warranty is always bullshit anyway. The dealership doesn’t fix problems that are covered under warranty.
I’d rather fucking walk. She had no idea that someone was ACTIVELY LISTENING to our conversations in the 
household, because this software can be deployed to their SMARTPHONES. Or, Google Chromebooks like the one 
Shenendehowa School District issued to my children. Or tablets, OR iPads, or Xbox/PS consoles.

Yeah, the thing is, SHENENDEHOWA thought I was outside of my fucking mind on 6/18/20.
I went there to talk about the ticket I submitted for the hotspot A FEW DAYS BEFORE AT THAT SAME PLACE. 
The woman at the front counter actually submitted the ticket FOR me... 
...because I couldn’t log into my kids account. 
Needed to log into HIS or HER account, while connected to the internet that I didn’t have.
Maybe, I’m a fuckin douchebag because I didn’t have a way to teleport to the school district and THEN,
read my kids minds and enter the password in, and THEN... I guess, whatever.
Nah, I went to the district office instead of this bullshit they were trying to have me do.
I later gave the ticket number to Dr. Robinson and his assistant at some point in October 2020.
Kristin Johnson went RIGHT AHEAD and CALLED CPS ON ME, committing CPS FRAUD, and had NO FUCKING IDEA, that I
had ALREADY SUBMITTED THAT THING. NOR that I had to call Elizabeth Riley...
...to get his password. Shocker.

Why...? Well, because I wanted to follow up on the ticket. My kids couldn’t do their schoolwork. 
No internet. That’s why I submitted the ticket there to begin with. 

Cause I walked back and forth to the school district and the lady was FAR LESS THAN HELPFUL.

I probably sound like I’m fuckin’ talking in circles at this point, right...?
I know I am.

I was trying to tell the people at the school that SOME PEOPLE TRIED TO MURDER ME OUTSIDE OF MY OLD JOB.
THEN, those SAME PEOPLE, were commandeering THEIR equipment, NOT THE SCHOOL ITSELF.
But these SERIAL KILLERS that BRUCE TANSKI and JOHN HOFFMAN, and ERIC CATRICALA, and MICHAEL ZURLO, and 
JAMES LEONARD, they all know these serial killers that tried to kill me.

So does my cousin [RYAN WARD*].
I could literally talk about a bunch of this shit in a video, and then, people will just say:

Nah, I wasn’t.
Fuckin’ had a MUCH BETTER CLUE, than ANY of the police. Why...?
Because of a CYBERATTACK on January 15th, 2019.
SERIOUS.
Led to me knowing that my phone was being REMOTELY CONTROLLED. (← Why I'm an EXPERT, and not PSYCHOTIC)

I THOUGHT, or ASSUMED, that because I worked at a COMPUTER SHOP...?
...that maybe people would realize I have more advanced knowledge about ...how someone could do that. 

If you happen to BE correct...? (like I was that whole time...?)
They will STILL write an incident report, attempting to make it SEEM like it’s ILLEGAL or a REPORTABLE offense. 
Yeah, they can actually WRITE UP A REPORT THAT DOES NOTHING.
It’s just a report. 
It’s like Michael Cook came here...? And said hello, then, he left.
“WHAT A DOUCHEBAG, BRO.” That’s exactly what SCSO-2020-003177 is. With Eric Catricala. 
“Dude showed up, said a couple things, and took the fuck off man, and this was like *checks watch* 3 days ago.” 

Cool. So the IMPRESSION that a TICKET exudes, is that I must be a fuckin’ troublemaker, because I’m trying to WARN 
people. So, I must be PSYCHOTIC to say stuff that’s SO CORRECT... that it just SOUNDS BAD.
 
If that SHOULD be illegal...? Then it should have been an ARRESTABLE OFFENSE. 
But, since it WASN’T, then what the fuck can they do except write a VERBATIM REPORT, that isn’t verbatim at all?  
Yeah, what I did, is not a fucking CRIME. 
The Constitution sorta overrides someone’s feelings about FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.
They’re sending people around taking reports and shit, it makes NO FUCKING SENSE. 
I’m telling people that I’m afraid of the police because they’re corrupt.
They’re not ALL corrupt, but the ones in charge are the only ones I’m worried about.
They’re corrupt.

When I say stuff to people, they hear like, PORTIONS of what I’m saying. Not FULL SENTENCES, or MULTIPLE POINTS.
Which is why I argue with my mother QUITE OFTEN. Because, she is literally that stupid.
I really don't HATE my mother, but she is... one dumb bitch, I swear.

The problem is that most people aren't as intelligent as my mother.
What do you think THAT means...?

Not 100% verbatim sentences at all. Nah. 

So, if I say that the Chromebook was being used to spy on me, the school will think that I actually accused 
THEM of doing that. Never accused THEM of doing that, at all. 

Never once said “You fucks are spyin’ on us in my house~!” 
What I said was that the thing was being used by SOME PARTY SOMEWHERE, and TRIED TO KILL ME ON 05/26/20.

I suppose people will even go so far as to say I'm “SPLITTING HAIRS”.

Not what I'm doing at all, actually.
I'm being VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT I MEAN WHEN I SAY WORDS...
...but what happens is that MORONS decide to fuckin guerilla warfare attack me from EVERY ANGLE, and sometimes
those morons have BADGES and HANDCUFFS and TASERS...

They may be MORONS because they have never read the CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA before.
And that's dangerous because they should know what it says BEFORE they become a POLICE OFFICER. Ya know...?

As for SHENENDEHOWA, well... they may have a HANDFUL of people who KNOW the people at the CIA/NSA or whatever...
But, they do not actually EMPLOY ANY of those people. I’m fuckin’ certain of that.

However, the Central Intelligence Agency sure as fuck does.

The Vault 7 toolkit, is a series of advanced hacking utilities that range from malware, to surveillance programs.
It was developed by THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY... and believe it or not...? I know more about it than 
CAPTAIN JEFF BROWN at SCSO. Cool.

One of those programs is known as “Weeping (Angel/Willow)”, and it was designed to eavesdrop on SmartTV’s.
While they're like OFF and DISCONNECTED FROM THE WIFI. Unbeknownst to the people at Shenendehowa...?
I did this thing called “made a video about HARDWARE SECURITY” WAYYYYY back in September 2019, called:

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
To explain how I'm more knowledgeable than anyone who works for the SARATOGA COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE, at: 
...matters related to NATIONAL SECURITY, as well as TECHNOLOGY...

In March 2018, a man by the name of Andrew Banas interviewed me for a segment called the “Alert Desk”, 
featured on a local news station NY Capital Region, News Channel 10. The segment was covering the fallout 
of the tool “Weeping Willow” (without explicitly stating as such) as it had apparently been modified by 
hackers to steal information from people’s wireless networks, devices, credit card numbers, etc. 

The tool is designed to allow a SmartTV to become an eavesdropping device. If a SmartTV can become an 
eavesdropping device, then really any other device with a microphone in it can ALSO be converted into one.

The CIA knows what that is, since they developed it. The National Security Agency knows what it is, because
they’ve been having to try and keep a lid on it. Same with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
These agencies have ALL had to deal with the fallout of these hacking tools, except it’s getting to 
the point where it is literally out of control. 

Someone Daniel Pickett is associated with, knows how to use many of these tools. 
They appear to have been working with each other very closely for years, because this party wants me to know 
that Daniel Pickett has been looking out for me. Didn’t know that. 

GOOD GUYS → will leave OBVIOUS CLUES. 
BAD  GUYS → will NOT leave really any clues at all, except the lingering sensation that somebody is watching. 

However, these observations are not all inclusive. 

Until I kept pounding away at the keyboard, and the remote party will occasionally deposit a randomly 
placed "keystroke" that I didn’t fuckin’ touch at all. 

Now, ALL OF THOSE DETAILS are hard to compact into a 12 second interaction that I would try to have if 
I waltzed on over to the district office again, following up on the ticket I submitted days beforehand,
for a hotspot. So, I can understand if I show up lookin’ like a fuckin’ lunatic that just so happens 
to be the most experienced technician in almost every building I walk into. 

That’s the take away here. 
Nearly every building I walk into...? 99% of the time, I am AT that moment, the MOST EXPERIENCED 
TECHNICIAN in that fuckin’ building. Though this really depends on WHAT building... I can say I could
walk into Spectrum’s office, and immediately be above LEVEL 3 MANAGER.

Cause, I'm a SECURITY ENGINEER. That's more involved than what they do.

This happens when I go to the (Clifton Park Public Safety building*), Verizon, Computer Answers, Walmart, 
Staples. I could literally be invited into the Golub Corporation building in Schenectady, and immediately, 
be more experienced than 90% of the people in that fuckin’ building. When the most experienced technicians
in that fuckin’ building look at my work, they will say "Damn, this dude is basically a fuckin’ genius..."
Of course, there are plenty of exceptions.

But, for me to translate that into words that people take seriously in 12 seconds...? 
It’s impossible... too much information, it’s like I’m speaking an entire book in the same amount of time, 
that Johnny 5 can READ it. “Input, Input~!” Except, backwards. Yeah, I won’t blame people for being totally
confused when I try to do that. It’s like I’m trying to shove hundreds of pages of text into a 12 second 
sentence, it’s gonna sound fuckin’ nuts. 

They don’t get it. Doesn’t fuckin’ compute. 
David Bishop, once being a real great friend of mine, apparently works for Microsoft. 
We spent so many years playing Q3A, with the textures all the way down. 
Then, we also went at it in Starcraft (original).

Dave and I went back and forth, but we spent a shitload of time playing Q3A. 
He was probably the best Q3A player in Shen, besides me.

Even HE, will not understand a 12 second explanation on the cosmos, network equipment configuration,
hardware, virtualization, graphic design, and application development, and how it intersects with:
digital security. Michael Neihaus, the guy who practically single-handedly made the Business Desktop 
Deployment tool to install Windows over a network, godfather of the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit,
System Center Configuration Manager, and like, a slew of other utilities... Even him, he’s not gonna 
understand a 12 second story about all that stuff... and the man has done plenty of complicated stuff.

Mike Niehaus, is actually a pretty cool son of a bitch, believe it or not. I wish him the best, cause 
I know I pissed that man off with my mouth, but it was cause I had someone LOCALLY doing some extremely
shady shit to me, and it involves a long list of potential avenues... the biggest avenue being: 
human trust, and why it is such a failed concept. 

As well as Ballmer and Gates... pretty sure that they’re not gonna invite me to their birthday party.
But- I don’t know. Maybe someday they will. I know I’ve upset these guys here and there, but as far as 
Mr. Neihaus is concerned, that dude knows I’m more than just a talented programmer, design artist, and 
system engineer. I literally sent the dude email after email just stuff that I wrote.

At some point I learned a pretty good lesson about being able to respect other people’s boundaries.
Cause they may not tell ya how they’re feeling. But- it’s pretty difficult to determine whether you’ve
upset somebody if they don’t communicate how they feel. Pretty sure that these guys did their homework
on me. Just by reading the things people write, they can derive whether something is total bullshit, or 
if something is plausible after all.

I'm gonna talk about the program that got me started down this RABBIT HOLE...
...System Center Configuration Manager

It is by far, the end all, be all... program that is basically at the center of every system.
Sytem Center.
And what it does, is it manages configurations for all of those systems... from a centralized location.

So.
It's pretty intense, AND, it's a LOT MORE METICULOUS and ATTENTIVE TO DETAIL, than the people at SCSO,
or the NYSP. Sometimes even the FBI. Or the NSA. Or the CIA. Or the DOD. Seriously. This thing is pretty
god damn meticulous, and it doesn't miss a fuckin' thing, dude.

...such as CERBERUS.

Cerberus is like APT29 but, they target rich bastards and financial institutions.
They like a nice hot flaming pecker in the asshole just as much as APT29 and Ted Cruz do.

I'm gonna tell you a little story about how I became an application developer, but FIRST- I feel it is my most 
sacred and humble duties, to provide a bit of backstory as to how this event occurred, and what the impact was.

This event occurred because Nfrastructure had just deployed a number of Cisco Catalyst switches to all of the 
branches that were to merge FROM First Niagara -> KeyCorp, as well as phasing out existing KeyCorp branches that 
the new FNFG branches made better locations.

In this transition, a former colleague that I had worked with at Computer Answers in Clifton Park, named Matthew 
Roerig, had been tasked with distributing the installation of these switches at various branches that summer in 
between July and August.

Matthew Roerig is about one of the coolest sons of bitches that you could ever meet.

However, there are some unknown details about this guy.
For one...? Sometimes he would have a slight bit of an overconfident vibe to him, and he would allow that to get 
the best of him. In other words, there were certain things that really pissed Matthew off. 

I have seen first hand how this dude will be one of the most calm as a cucumber types of dudes that anyone in the 
world had ever seen, but- as soon as someone BEGINS to put some social SOCIAL PRESSURE on him...? 

He'll actually cave, because of it.

I haven't seen this too many times, but Matt had a few questions surrounding him, that I had never been able to 
answer. For one, how did one of his messages through Signal manage to get to my iPhone 8+ prior to 01/15/19...?

Well, it's a question I still ask myself... 
"Well, suppose we went ahead and saw how good this dudes' two shoes really are...?"

I AM kidding but I am ALSO being serious...
Most people think I talk in one way or another, but sometimes I am literally questioning in both respects,
simultaneously. It is a talent that few people pick up on, believe it or not.

I had my radios disengaged, WiFi, Bluetooth, and Cell service, all radios were disengaged, and one of his messages 
still managed to come through. I had accused him of having hacked my device... I may have been incorrect about that. 

However, I'm not one to write off a minor coincidence. Especially one such as the one I just mentioned.

Regardless... 
He was employed by the Nfrastructure Corporation at some point AFTER working with me at:

Matt quit Computer Answers on January 5th, 2016. 
From that point forward...? 
It was just Dwayne and I. 

Just, (2) dudes...

Together, (2) guys, just me and this old bastard, Dwayne O. Coonradt...?
We cleaned the fuckin' house for (3) months straight, earning over 30K in sales per month. 

Him...? Telling stories about how he farted in elevators and pissed off mob bosses, or like, tripped on LSD and 
had conversations with the flies about how hungry they must've been, flying onto heaps of shit while he was
landscaping... these are the types of stories I found myself being told by this dude.

Me...? Just kicking as much ass as humanly possible, upgrading the equipment, telling Pavel how lazy he is/was, 
making hundreds to thousands of suggestions to make the system/company more money/efficient...

Whether it was in the Clifton Park store, Albany store, or the (2) of us were painting the floors and walls at: 
___________________________________________________________

…with a lovely shade of Battleship Gray...
…Dwayne told people cool stories, and I just did all of the work that brought more money into the company.

Back to back, him telling his cool/funny stories, and me, just bringing in so much profit that it's not even funny.
Look. There's a lot of shit I remember about this dude, he was the best 2nd place salesman at Computer Answers...
...hands down. Reliably consistent at always coming in 2nd place...
That's Dwayne Coonradt for ya.

Pavel Zaichenko would never once in his lifetime ever come close to the dedication this dude had.
You don't get that type of high-quality, back-to-back, consecutive ass kickings provided to everybody... 
...not without (2) dudes who knew how the game was factually played amongst professionals, masters, and experts.

Anyway, during this period of time, I managed to become interested in a position with KeyCorp.
I thought it'd be a perfect opportunity to take the game to an even higher level...

Dwayne and Pavel were both sorta sad that I would migrate onto becoming a help-desk technician at this bank. 
But, not just any bank... nah. A bank where the motto is "Key-to-you banking, but done right."

Unbeknownst to the banking employees I worked with, my FATHER, MICHAEL EDWARD COOK...
...STILL HAD AN ACTIVE ACCOUNT WITH THEM... 
...cause my mother filed for BANKRUPTCY with JUDGE MAHONEY in 1984 and couldn't get her OWN shit...
...and my mother had a joint account with my FATHER, at KeyBank going back to about 1987...

I believe it was OPENED at 1703 US-9, Clifton Park, NY 12065... before Nfrastructure ever existed.

I realize all of these details sorta feel tangential, but they'll all culinate into a pretty heavy-handed, 
indisputable point shortly...

Yeah, so- "Key-to-you banking, but done right" is not really their motto, but it's close enough...
...they may even say "*shaking head* that isn't our motto, but I guess it works..." 

Regardless, by the time I had been at this company for a few months, Matt had made his way to the few 
associated badasses that Daniel Pickett probably hand selected, to be a core part of the migration from...
FNFG → KeyCorp

I could imagine how that conversation went, too...

Dan  : Yeh.

Matt : Well, I appreciate that, sir.
       I'll do my best to serve the company's bottom line.
Dan  : Kid, I don't even question for one second whether you would, or not.
Matt : Yeah...?
       Well, why would you say that...?

       You're a loyal, dependable son-of-a-bitch, and my god...
       ...*taps chest* I'm gonna make damn certain that *points* you go places, kid.
Matt : ...what kinds of places...?
Dan  : *chuckles* Heh.
       Don't you even worry about that one bit...
       You're gonna have more places to go than you'll even know what to do with...
Matt : ...wait, really...?
Dan  : *nodding* Damn straight dude.
       So many places you'll be goin'...?
       It'll make yer fuckin' head spin, lemme tell ya.
Matt : Uh, I'd prefer if my head didn't spin...?
Dan  : Whoa, now hold up a minute there, frosted flakes...
       Did I just hear you say you'd prefer if your head didn't spin...?
Matt : Yeah, I'm all for goin a bunch of places, but I really would prefer that my head not start recklessly spinning...
       ...cause that'd probably kill me. 
       I mean, to be fair, I'm still excited.
Dan  : Yeah, well, it WAS a metaphor, but- you were supposed to go with the metaphor, dude.
       Now you just threw me off on a tangent.
Matt : First Niagara...?
Dan  : Right.
       So...
       You're gonna drive around a fuckin' box truck full of Cisco Catalyst switches that you're gonna install.
Matt : I can do that.
Dan  : Well, I know you can.
       Just by lookin' at the way you adjust your glasses all the time, you make an accurate or correct statement...?
       You immediately adjust your glasses, like you're a friggen know-it-all...
Matt : I DO do that, don't I...?
Dan  : Yeah.
       Psychology 101, dude.
       Adjusting your glasses is like YOU saying "And that's that."
Matt : Never knew that...
Dan  : Yeah, well, NOW ya know.
       Mr. Gates from Microsoft does that too...among a few others.
Matt : Alright, so I'm gonna install a bunch of Cisco Catalyst switches...?
Dan  : Yep. 
       You down...?
Matt : Sure.
       Is there like a pay raise or whatever...?
Dan  : *chuckles* Heh.
       Listen to THIS son-of-a-bitch...
       Yeah dude.
Matt : Fuck yeh, dude.
Dan  : Wouldn't be sendin' ya on an awesome fuckin' mission if I wasn't gonna throw a huge stack of cash at ya to 
       get the job done... alright?
Matt : Alright, Mr. Pickett, I won't let ya down.
Dan  : Oh, I know.
       Wouldn't have hand picked you for this job if I didn't already know that.
Matt : Alright, cool.
Dan  : Awesome.
       It's settled.

...and then Nfrastructure sent a lot of dudes just like Matt Roerig all over the god damn state.
It started with the local branches, but it wound up becoming a few weeks of perilous journey, driving down 
highways, in and out of canyons, eventually making it to the next branch... installing a shitload of switches, 
and then...?

Taking the fuck off, as if they weren't even there, dude.

A whole team of dudes did this for ... days-to-weeks, during the hottest months anybody could do such a thing...
July, and August.

Look, here's the situation.
They installed the switches, which had relatively nothing to do with the program,

However- I think that the Globally Unique Identifier that came up during the little SCCM ERROR, SHIT DOESN'T LOOK
RIGHT...? Well, it obviously had a PRETEXT for such a BLATANT ERROR that NEVER CAME UP BEFOREHAND...

So, that is the backstory part.
Here's where it becomes interesting.

I had just handled a KeyCounselor ticket for John Hoffman, the guy that does the maintenance for Halfmoon 
Heights. Same guy just so happens to be a coin magician and will perform at childrens birthday parties, and then 
record videos of it.

Same guy just so happened to run into me and my son on May 25th, 2020 at approximately 9AM.
What'd this dude talk to me and my son about...?
Well, he told me that if anybody ever even THINKS about stealing money from his accounts...?
He's got a security team that shows up before the POLICE even show up.
That security team will perform their own investigation and provide the police with the details they need...
...before the police even get there.

Wanna know something really cool about that though...?
That's all bullshit. The reason why it's bullshit is because that is LITERALLY THE DEFINITION OF BANK FRAUD.

And I believe that this SECURITY TEAM that JOHN HOFFMAN was talking about... might be a bunch of hackers that
work with corrupt police agencies like SCSO, NYSP, FBI, etc. And that THEY work with a group of CRIMINALS known
as CERBERUS.

Cerberus is pretty high level. 
They're very good at programming AND skullfucking opponents left and right.
However, one KEY WAY TO TAKE THEM OUT...
...is to DO MORE WORK THAN CORRUPT/LAZY COPS that ignore shit like LEADS.

You know...? You'll never CATCH THE BAD GUYS, if you ACT A LOT LIKE THEY DO...
Trooper RUFFAS should probably take note of the SERIAL KILLERS that I recorded in the VIDEO that I recorded...
...outside of COMPUTER ANSWERS and the CATRICALA FUNERAL HOME wayyyyyyy back on MAY 26th, 2020.

Almost as if there were a group of useless faggots with badges that keep throwing me into a series of records...

Pretty sure that I have a pretty rare set of skills and talents, and I think that these guys may agree.
Not gonna say why. They probably have read what I’ve written about how to terminate my own network cables, and use 
SSH and PowerShell to interact with routers, switches, and etc. remotely. 

There’s a long list of other things I can do as well, but- I’ve felt the choke points all along the way.

Pavel Zaichenko is familiar with this feeling, where he knows for a fact, that his ass would make a lot more money 
if I ran his company, than him. Why...? Because he... had never seen such high numbers from anybody. The reason why 
Dwayne wound up being a VP, and REMAINS in that position, isn’t because he’s the best technician that ever lived. 
Nor the best salesman that ever sold ice to an eskimo. 

It’s his CONNECTIONS and PEOPLE HE KNOWS. Ah.
That’s why I could do most of the work, and they could scrape everything off the top. 
Not cause they can do the same level of work...? 
But because, eating a plate of humble pie... doesn’t seem very appetizing to them.

I have no doubt that there’s SOMEONE in New York State that has more experience than I do.
I could be an asshole and just write another story about being the best fuckin’ guy that did anything at whatever, 
and not make the story really fair for anybody else. 

Whether I’m a design artist, system engineer, developer, author, whatever...
I’ve rarely met many people face-to-face... that could give me a challenge that I couldn’t complete.
Sometimes I touch on subjects that I don’t know how to talk about, that’s the most challenging 
aspect of all. Making observations of other people’s psychology and their responses... 
...without seeing, hearing, or reading them...
...
Now I’m writing a book that I’m throwing everything I can muster, into. Since that is security.

For instance, if I fill out a job application and then my resume says: 
Microsoft Deployment Toolkit/FightingEntropy – Beginning the fight against ID theft and cybercrime...
...they don’t understand how complicated all of this shit is. 

What I have determined is that there’s a lot more to it than just the programming, code, and logic.
I’d wager that the HR reps don’t even bother to look at it, they’ll hire some kid who’s (mom/dad) sent him 
to a really GREAT school, even though I’m far more experienced. Or, what’ll happen, is that my profile never 
makes it to their eyeballs. I don’t KNOW that’s what’s happening or not, but I can SPECULATE, that it is.
And, this shit has been happening since I was terminated from Nfrastructure.

You don’t terminate someone for having 7h40m of free time on their hands every day, after they’ve taken a 
4h process, and compacted it down to 20m. But- hey. That’s what they fuckin’ did to me.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Person1 : YEAH...?
          DUDE LITERALLY SPENT 20 MINUTES A DAY DOING HIS JOB, and then spent 7H40M just fucking around...?
Person2 : Basically.
Person1 : Why would they fire him for that...?
Person2 : I *shakes head* I dunno man...
Person1 : That dude should be like a millionaire or something.
Person2 : Why...?
Person1 : Dude literally spent 20 minutes a day to do an 8 hour job.
Person2 : Well... 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

If people ever ask me questions, like “Why do you manipulate people",  they’d determine that the answer is 
because... "Sometimes people lie, or prefer to be lazy."

The follow up question is never "How do you KNOW they LIE or are LAZY...?", but- it’s not something I can 
translate to another person, that I’m a walking lie detector. 

Some people choose to NOT respond to me, but that’s just as telling as responding with a moronic statement.

I don’t do these things when I’ve made a conclusion, that the party I’m communicating with can be trusted. 
That is extremely difficult to do without context.
People that can be trusted, are usually cooperative and helpful. 
Just like Michael Whitacre from SCSO. 

Yeah, I don’t like reading the report he wrote on June 19th, 2020... because some things got lost in 
translation, but- that’s how the game "telephone" works. One person heard something like a crazy guy 
showing up at 5 Chelsea Place, yellin’ at the receptionist, tellin’ everybody that their fuckin’ uncles 
a douchebag and a half, and that some little green men had control of the universe and the Chromebook.

Yeah. Probably sounds like a fuckin’ hilarious summary of what I did on June 18th, 2020 at 5 Chelsea Place.
I never said any of that shit, at all. 
BUT- it could wind up being written on an actual statement written by an actual police officer, somewhere. 
I can discern when someone is writing something down in response to what they’ve been told, versus them 
choosing to insert words, just because they can. 

Mark Sheehan, isn’t a bad guy or at least, didn’t treat me like a fuckin’ psychopath... 
But, chose to take no action when told that my neighbor tried to attack me with his baseball bat on 06/13/20. 
Bill didn’t like how I kept telling my mother about the 2 dudes that tried to kill me, and how SCSO seems to 
have some corrupt asswipe that doesn’t care that I was almost killed. Fine.

Everyone thought I was JUST poppin’ off at the mouth, but I was ALSO doing more than that.
Truth be told, someone deployed (Pegasus/Phantom) to my Apple iPhone 8+, and then tried to murder me on
05/26/20, then during that murder attempt they ALSO blocked (2) of my 911 calls, and then SCSO didn’t do a 
god damn thing about it that could be measured by me as "helpful" - other than Jeffrey Kaplan following 
Schelling after picking me up at Zappone. 

Cause, I’m fairly certain I would have died that night, if Jeffrey Kaplan did NOT follow Scott Schelling. 

However, they did do a god damn thing about it that I measure as "malicious". 
As in, assisting the guys that tried to murder me, by saying: 
“Alright, Leonard. Do your fuckin’ worst bro.”

I can see this when I ask for records, or I don’t get phone calls when told that I’ll get one, or when 
I’m sentenced to 20 fuckin’ days in the county jail, cause Paul Pelagalli thinks I’m fuckin’ nuts. 
Probably does. 
I don’t know what that dude thinks. But, if that is the case, he can think that if he wants to. 
I have an exhibit of him in a courtroom, admitting that he was careless when he wrote a court order that
I couldn’t fuckin’ follow...

I don’t give a flying fuck if that process is illegal, because...? 
I will be making criminal accusations against Saratoga County Family Court, and SCSO.

After saying it hundreds of times, I realize what the problem is.
Not only am I being censored, but I’m also being largely ignored.

So, having a BOOK, should override the “Well, I was told that, <such and such>...”
...because those people will realize “Oh, shit. This dude is just a LOT smarter than most people.”

And, Saratoga County Childrens Protective Services. And, Saratoga Hospital.
Having that audio recording makes me sound a lot more credible than him, and Neil Weiner. 
Neil Weiner, his job is to be a professional excuse haver.

So is Sarah Schellinger’s. Or, was. She had no fuckin’ clue that I spent every single day at the jail, 
planning to fire her ass, and report the whole incident, to the district attorneys office. 
Public Integrity board. 

The problem is, even if the District Attorney happens to be as skilled as Chuck Schumer...?

Guys like Andrew Cuomo could literally be involved in attempting to kill me, and never see a day in court 
for it. Same with Hillary Clinton, or really... anybody else on the list. Too important to be charged with
a crime... Maybe that’s the take away here, is that, someone important could steal CPM from Gary Kildall, 
right? Then, write that dude a check for `$20K afterward. 

No problem. Sorry for taking your hard work Gary. Now fuck off already. 

That’s exactly how that whole story feels to me. I am aware there’s a lot more to it than that, so I’m not 
going to make speculations about what I couldn’t possibly know. 
What I do know is that there’s a REALLY GOOD REASON why Windows XP was released the DAY BEFORE 10/26/01.

I’m going to describe the profile of the person that has the capabilities, total lack of empathy, and highly
immoral nature, that would readily define this “serial killer” type.

$Book.AddSection(9,"Intent (1)",@"
James Leonard is a part of this group of people with (deadly/malicious/nefarious) intent.
Does not seem to have a conscious from what I can tell.

James Leonard at SCSO wrote (2) tickets: SCSO-2020-003173/003177. 
The reason I know that SCSO James Leonard is a dirty cop, is because, someone should’ve probably made a really 
big deal about the phone line I severed. 

Severing a phone line is probably a very big deal! Way bigger deal than a fuckin’ kayak strap. Right...? 

Well, think again fuckface... 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

          Phone line not a real important thing... 
          That kayak strap though...? 
          We’re gonna arrest your ass for that...
          ...instead of doing something about a couple cocksuckers trying to kill you for over 90m.

Zack was fine with his phone line being severed too, he didn’t mind at all. He came outside and talked to me. 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Zack : Hey, can you cut my phone line...? 
       Please...?
Me   : ...why...?
Zack : Cause man...
       I don’t need this fuckin’ thing.
       *I* would personally cut it myself, but- you could really help me out by doin’ that.
       I won’t call the police, or tell em nothin’, bro.
Me   : What you’re askin’ me sounds moronic though... 
       Unless I was trying to call 911, or YOU were, then, why cut the damn thing...?
Zack : I dunno man.
       You just gotta *long sigh* live and learn, man...
       *shakes head* Who would we be, if we didn’t...?
Me   : This has got to be the weirdest fuckin’ thing someone asked me to do.
       Just, on a whim.
Zack : Nah man, I’ve been keepin’ an eye on ya.
       My drone, I usually fly it around and I just follow ya around and stuff...
       *points* You, my friend... 
       You’re somethin’, pal.
Me   : Well, are the (2) fuckfaces that just tried to run me over near Key Bank, in there...?
Zack : Yes.
Me   : Alright, well... 
       Fine, I will do it.
Zack : Excellent.
       By the way, don’t cut my kayak strap, that will piss me the fuck off, dude...
Me   : Oh, really...?
Zack : Yeah. 
       Don’t do that.
Me   : What if I do, though...?
Zack : *scoffs* Bro, you better NOT cut that...
Me   : What, this...?
       Right here...?
Zack : DUDE...
       C’mon bro. 
Me   : *puts knife over strap*
Zack : BRO.

See...? Zack had a couple dudes hanging out with him in his house.    

In the particular high-definition video I recorded on my Apple iPhone 8+ between (05/25/20 2343 → 0526/20 0004),
I was able to capture:
1) what this rich brat looks like
2) what this sounds like
3) what this looks like as he confirms with body movements, that he had an active tunnel to my device.
______________________
| Why I’m aggravated |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Sounds a lot like 1776 to me. 
Cause if the police try to tell me that they have never been able to catch these people in the act, they’re lying. 
Or, they’re just totally oblivious. Cause, nah. 
They either 1) know, or 2) they should retire.

The reason they had never been CAUGHT, isn’t because the police CAN’T do anything about it...
It’s because the police actually lack any INCENTIVE to arrest some “Rich Brat” that kills people, and just gets 
away with it over and over.

If anything, the police are given an incentive to ignore that kids activities.
Why...? It’s too dangerous. What if the ‘“Rich Brat” gets mad at them...? 
Then THEY gotta worry about that “Rich Brat”, killin’ THEM.

But, if it’s just some random person out there, that’s fine. 
They’re OK with that... cause that’s not THEM.
Even Dwayne said on June 18th, 2020...
I said to Dwayne:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me     : Hey, Catricala is killin’ people.
Dwayne : Hey man, as long as they’re not killin’ me or anybody in MY family...?
         I don’t care WHAT they do...
         They can kill whoever they want.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

The ^ IMPRESSION that he was EXUDING, was FAKE SARCASM.
Fake sarcasm, means that there IS a sense of sarcasm, but it is like a double negative.
That means, he was LITERALLY stating how he REALLY felt.

Then one day some mean man <unspecified> someone that probably deserves to BE <unspecified> already... 
... because not one single person had the audacity to fulfill this activity before. 

Well... someone actually got scared. 
They don’t know what <unspecified> means, but the context sounds interesting...

A series of people that had a lot of money, thought they were basically royalty. 
When someone is ROYALTY, they don’t have to follow the same rules everyone else does.
So if Prince Andrew and some other dude are blowing each other in a 69 position...?
Then you are not allowed to call Prince Andrew “gay” for doing that.
Because, he’s royalty. Any OTHER dude, then all bets are off.
^ That’s how ROYALTY works.

Sorta like way back in 1776. 
Some people made the mistake, of underestimating someone that they shouldn’t have... 
and then the journey to draft the Constitution of the United States of America began. 

It was basically a big middle finger to the rich brats in England way back then.
Not unlike how I’m writing this fuckin’ document right now... 
...being a big middle finger to some people that obviously don’t know what that means.
Nah. Nobody has ever given em a middle finger before... cause of how rich they are.

Way too (rich/important) to know what a genuine middle finger from somebody looks like.
Everyone they’ve ever met, has treated them as if they are very important, all the time.
Sometimes people will pretend like what they do is actually impressive or amazing.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\
    
Maid:     Oh wow, that is the *most* IMPRESSIVE shit that I have *ever* seen anybody take in my whole life...!
Rich kid: Heh. Really...?
Maid:     Why, yes little boy...~!

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

But this is how people treat TUCKER CARLSON. 
And Sean Hannity. 
Probably RUPERT MURDOCK, and Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz... 
And, Bob Lutz.
    
I’d be willing to bet actual hard earned money, that none of these fucking people would know what to 
do with themselves, if someone gave them a middle finger... Like, a fuckin’ genuine one too. It’s not 
unlike tellin’ somebody "Kiss my ass" or even "suck a fuckin’ dick". 
They’re all statements that equate to "go fuck yourself".
        
Except this middle finger, wasn’t just a middle finger to these morons back in 1776...
...it was also meant for anyone else that seems to think that it’s ok to lie to people...
...and not expect that someone might eventually <unspecified> them for doing such a thing.
    
It’s not *little white lies* that cause people to write this document.
Nobody ever got mad at somebody for lying about something that carried no weight.
Lies that cause people to write stuff that’ll make even the (police/investigators) scared, are when someone: 
- attempted to kill somebody, and they failed (like what happened to me on 5/26/20)
- already killed somebody else (like my father on 10/23/95)
- lies about someone’s credibility (like someone from Russia has been doing)
- lies about global warming, AND, gets paid to keep disillusioning the world (like Not News)
        
It’s not situations where some dude fucks your girlfriend...
...that cause someone to want to <unspecified> someone.
It’s when people do what Theodore Roosevelt had to put a stop to...
...that causes some people to think that the system is broken, and how to forcibly fix it.

I know that some people are going to read that and say "forcibly fix it"...?
Yeah. Forcibly. Meaning, by force.
Cause it’s broken and nobody has any intention of fixing it at all.
    
Someone that wasn’t even named at all, started getting really concerned...
...about some man figuring out who they are and where they live...
...that an actual FBI man FINALLY got involved... 
Because, the FBI man didn’t give a shit that the rich brats attempted to kill some random dude.
Even though, the evidence was sitting right there on the table...? 
Sometimes it’s worth explaining to people just how fuckin’ lazy a lot of people are.
    
That rich brat has killed a LOT of people.
That rich brat has never seen the inside of a prison cell, NOR has he ever been caught...
...because people make too many assumptions.

So, someone that was bright enough to figure out how many lazy people there are in America... 
...they had to set some bear traps all over the place.

These are the types of traps where if you step in one...? 
Then you’ll have to have your leg amputated.

The “Rich Brat”, stepped in one, because he just fucked with the wrong person.
The “Rich Brat” tried to ask his federal investigator buddies to abuse their position or authority...
...and get the mean man in trouble...
...but those guys told the “Rich Brat” that he was on his own.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Investigators: You did this shit to yourself, kid. 
“Rich Brat”  : He said bear traps and I stepped in one.
Investigators: A lot of people say bear traps kid. Can’t go chasin’ some dude cause he wrote a story.
“Rich Brat”  : What about my leg though...?
Investigators: Well, what about your leg?
“Rich Brat”  : I’m gonna kill this guy if you guys don’t.
Investigators: Hey, I don’t know what the hell this kid just said, but I think it’s time to go.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

The investigators started using these terms:  
"I almost heard this kid threaten to kill somebody, but then I realized... obviously I didn’t.", 
...and then they stopped bowing to the beck and whim of this kid that THEY KNEW, was out there... 
...killing a lot of people.

Now the fuckin’ kid realizes that his days are actually numbered. 
Someone with no money to his name, was a lot more intelligent than his ass...
...and managed to get him so badly, that he needed to get his leg amputated. 

And that’s what happened to some “Rich Brat” that fucked with the wrong person.
None of that money that HE nor his parents had... 
...nor any of the people he knew, made a single bit of difference. 
        
Aw. Fuckin demonic fuckface had to get his leg amputated. 
Poor “Rich Brat”... (Mom/dad) couldn’t buy the “Rich Brat” a new leg... 
Aww. =`( 
All of the people this dipshit killed...?
The thousands of them...?
They were all laughing at this cocksucker.

These federal investigators knew damn well what this kid was doing. 
They’ve had to pull his ass out of the fire before. Over and over.
Even they were pretty frustrated, cause this kids’ mommy and daddy bought him a "game genie". 
With this "game genie", the brat could cyberstalk people in real life, so if he wanted to rape some girl...? 
Well, “Rich Brat” could do that.

“Rich Brat” couldn’t get laid without it.
He fuckin’ TRIED... but he preferred to have sex with her DEAD BODY instead.
Exactly like Ted Bundy.
Well, actually...? 
WAY WORSE THAN TED BUNDY.

Just imagine TED BUNDY not needing a YELLOW PAGES PHONEBOOK.
Cause he’s got a SMARTPHONE and FACEBOOK.
And, TINDER. And, like, SNAPCHAT.
I’m not really trying to limit the creativity here, I know this son of a bitch has a TEAM of people helping.
My cousin RYAN WARD is one of those people.

A lot of people thought that TED BUNDY would never do such a thing, because of how many morons misjudged him. 
This kid, is quite intelligent. 
Hasn’t gotten caught yet (well,he’s definitely gotten caught, but the FBI disabled my phone...) 
I mean, not by someone that’s willing to bring him to jail.
Which is a lot of them. 
    
This kid is extremely dangerous, he has a brother which is almost as bad.
They are a lot smarter than most of police I’ve gone to for help, sad to say.
Even the doctors too. 
Even the lawyers.
Even the judges.
All of them, had no fucking clue whatsoever, that THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. 
Has been happening, since BEFORE 05/26/20
    
Think about this girl GABBY PETITO. She went missing and they knew that she was with her fiancee, and 
they actually managed to find BRIAN LAUNDRIE, and these fucks killed this dude like a fuckin’ twig. 
Then, well... whoops, he *somehow* got killed. Yeah... he was fuckin’ destroyed by these smart bastards... 
he wasn’t clobbered by a penis. He was clobbered with actual clubs and baseball bats. 

That’s why they found like a PIECE of his skull or whatever... He didn’t commit suicide at all. 
These fucks found him. What I mean is, these dudes were able to track him down with this software. 
That’s how OBLIVIOUS the actual police are.

This kid that I detected using an advanced tool to remote into (computers/smartphones)...? 
He’s smarter than those people, but it’s possible that he might be part of the same group.
They are basically SATANIC WORSHIPPERS. 
And, they (probably) fucked this kid in the ass, made him scream more than Ted Cruz does when Exxon Mobil
shoves their dick in his ass, he doesn’t get killed though, he gets `$millions deposited into his bank account. 
    
BRIAN LAUNDRIE, probably screamed. 
Oh well dude. 
You killed your fiancee... tough luck.

The truth is, people made a lot of assumptions.
They thought the police would’ve caught a serial killer by now, but how the fuck can they do that...
...if they’re not collecting evidence or leads...?
WELL... it is literally as simple as the police being blindsided. Constantly.

The answer is, they just GUESS.
Every single police officer that reads this document...?
They’re gonna know that I’m not making this shit up.
Nobody writes a document this long, if they’re just making it up out of thin air.
The portions of the document where I’m obviously making shit up, to insult people... 
...those parts are fucking obvious for a reason.

What is NOT so obvious, is when I start talking about ERIC CATRICALA, BRUCE TANSKI, JOHN HOFFMAN, MICHAEL ZURLO, 
JAMES LEONARD, PAVEL ZAICHENKO, I have no doubt that none of these people, right...? 
Not one of em, wants to accept or admit, that I might be smarter than all of them too.
Still alive... right? 
Right. 
    
Back on June 18th, 2020, I told TROOPER BORDEN that I knew about THIS program being on my device.
I didn’t know what it was called. 
I found out when it was talked about on Al Jazeera, AND THEN a few months later on NBC Nightly News.
It’s called (Pegasus/Phantom) by the NSO Group.

The people he called were the Federal Counter-Terrorism Intelligence Agency
This guy called em, and said: 
Borden : Hey, do the (police/military) have access to a program that can track people’s phones...?
Those people didn’t realize that the Russians were watching them as they said ‘no’ 
That’s why Solorigate also goes by the name of:

A 2020 Federal Data Breach, is when, the feds fucked up really badly, because they had BAD INFORMATION, 
and couldn’t do their job because someone smarter than them fuckin’ told them

Wanna know how they were able to successfully pull off such a damaging, unrelentingly TERRIBLE heist...?
OH WELL CHECK IT OUT BRO... PEGASUS/PHANTOM... PROBABLY A KEY CLUE THAT I TRIED TO HAND SCOTT SCHELLING.
Like, WAY back on (05/26/20 0130).

But then check this shit out... SCSO just kept pretending like they couldn't see the shit pile they left behind...
Check it out. SCSO-2020-003564. Let them read that fucking document.

I can’t expect some people to know what the hell that is, but that is a record from the Saratoga County Sheriffs 
Office, that MARK SHEEHAN wrote. It says something that you won’t believe... 

“US Government AND the Russians hacking my equipment and censoring my social media” -MARK SHEEHAN

ALMOST all of the stuff MARK SHEEHAN wrote is FALSE, I even sent an audio recording of my stepfather admitting 
that those details are invalid to SERGEANT JOHN HILDRETH. Then, he sent me an email stating that he couldn’t use 
that recording, etc. so forth and that Laura Hughes stated that she never spoke with the doctor at 
Saratoga Hospital. Well, she fucking told me that, to my face. So, that woman lied to John Hildreth. 
Anyway... side point.

What is true, is that the US Government AND the Russians, were attacking me way back then. 
Prior to 06/13/20. Like, 6 full fuckin’ months before Solorigate. Wanna know how they’re fuckin’ morons...? 

Might be because a lot of people have been getting killed by these serial killers AND, RUSSIAN INTELLIGENCE.
Maybe I’m not even allowed to be attacked by Russians at all, so that’s why they give me a hard time...

When I say getting killed by this kid what I mean is: 
- they are actual serial killers that kill REAL people [VERY OFTEN] (I don’t know the rate, maybe 5 kills a week?)
- victims aren’t      ever FOUND | - they find a (COOL/CREATIVE) way to get rid of (body/bodies)
- reason why nobody’s ever FOUND | - I.E. turn it into MULCH, throw it into concrete slurry, feed it to pigs, etc.

Considering how much RESISTANCE I’ve been facing...? 
- I had to keep pounding out this COMPELLING DOCUMENT. 
- I had to RIP APART SO MANY CONCEPTS, and build it all from the ground up. To say I did this myself is incorrect.
- I know damn well what I saw because I expected it 
- I literally caught these fucks in a TRAP and recorded them both in a video that I didn’t expect to be DESTROYED
- That is the ONLY REASON I don’t have better pictures

Even after I was able to catch these demonic cocksuckers? The FBI, allowed some fuckface to disable my device.
- When the police say ‘grumble grumble, you’re fuckin’ annoying me kid, you sound nuts’... 
- I gotta fuckin’ wake up grandpa SOMEHOW... Cause he’s a little fuckin’ slow lately. 
- Doesn’t respond to being called an (idiot/lazy/cocky/none of that), and to be fair, I don’t blame him.
- He despises when someone without a badge actually does a better job than his ass... 
- However, CRITICAL CLUES and LEADS have been ignored for 2+ years now.
- That means additional people have died because nobody (cared/gave a shit) | → BRUISED EGOS < DEAD PEOPLE

I can tell ya, SOMEBODY is NOT SLOW ON THE UPTAKE AT ALL. And THAT dude, has been keepin’ an eye on me.

[ZUCKERBERG] is NOT the person that’s actually killing people, I don’t believe. However, he is probably in 
cahoots with the dudes I just listed, somehow... right...? And these (2) dudes in these pictures...

Now, I know people will say “WOW BRO, THATS (2) DUDES FROM A REAL LONG DISTANCE AWAY, THERE’S NO WAY TO MAKE AN 
IDENTIFICATION OFF OF THAT...” Right, well... I had a fuckin’ VIDEO of the (1) dudes’ face. His face, CLOSE UP.
His VOICE, very clearly heard. Showed that video to my DAUGHTER and my SON, and then TROOPER LEAVEY showed up...
I had spent SO MUCH TIME TRYING TO GET THE VIDEO OFF OF MY DEVICE, but guess what...? Apple was preventing that.
-----------------------------------------------------------------                     -------------------------
If it wasn’t Apple, then I don’t know how to better phrase it. I had a video, I showed a NYS Trooper, and 5 min
after the dude left...? My phone had a BLACK SCREEN. Had to unplug the battery, because hey... I actually replaced
the screen on this particular device MYSELF. Cause, I’m an actual EXPERT. Like, a REAL ONE. Not a FAKE EXPERT.

I can’t RULE THAT OUT, however. Maybe he is. But, I doubt it.
However, these local guys that tried to get ME near COMPUTER ANSWERS...? 
Well, I’ve seen them before. The way I see it, if somebody has a really cool idea...?
Well, MARK ZUCKERBERG will definitely think about killin’ somebody, won’t he...?
I don’t think he’s the ONLY BILLIONAIRE on the TOP 10 BILLIONAIRES LIST that does this shit.
He may be the only one. But- I really don’t want to drop my guard. Then again, maybe that’s my EXTENDED FORECAST.
I don’t mean a literal weather forecast, I’m referring to “who knows how many people he’s gotten away with
having killed...”

Because here’s the bottom line.
IF my device, somehow DISABLED itself, it is because the VIDEO that I recorded of the tool that 
(Zuckerberg → Lobal crew) was USING was recorded on video, 3x times. 

Maybe he wasn’t doing any of this at all.
Just, conveniently appeared as if it could’ve been him that whole time...

The “Paragraph of Fallacious Comments”...
Dude’s got WAY too much money, he doesn’t need to stoop to such a LOW level, does he...?
Hell no bro. 
He’s above that.
Mark Zuckerberg is the best dude that ever lived, throughout all of human history...
There are NO EXCEPTIONS WHATSOEVER...
Dude pays his bills on time, he’s never late with a check, makes sure not to offend anybody...
There’s no fuckin’ way that he would ever think about killin’ anybody, and then taking somebody’s idea.
Not a chance, dude.
End of “Paragraph of Fallacious Comments”

Yeah, whatever.
I could imagine if I lived in WW2 and I called Hitler a fuckin’ little pansy boy...
Or, things just as terrible as what I’ve said to Zuckerberg...
...that Hitler would’ve wasted no time at all doing 1 of 2 things...
1) being fuckin’ impressed, and promoting me to someone really important...?
2) killing me in my sleep, or just, the most cowardly way possible.

Money causes people to do incredibly evil shit. 
    
If the dude wants me to shut the fuck up already....? 
Well, lets find this fuckin’ kid and throw his ass in jail.
If nobody wants to help me with that... fine. 
Let this kid kill more people.
Didn’t fucking know that this kid, was using software... called Pegasus.
    
The reason these cocksuckers tried to kill me is because 12h before that, I made a video talking about 
further developing Cortana to be a number of things, because PRISM being abused. 

Since Trooper Borden is the most up-to-date smartest cop, that ever fuckin’ lived...?
He’s got this shit covered.
So, I can rest easy.
He literally told me, nothin’ ever gets by HIM, without him knowing.

Except, when it came to Solorigate, and the fact that I knew this program Pegasus/Phantom was on the device that
he called the Federal Counter-Terrorism Intelligence Agency about... on June 18th, 2020.
I mean, besides knowing more than HIM the FIRST time I met this dude...? 
Then yeah, NOTHING slips by this dude.

I didn’t know the NAME of the program, but I knew that a program was allowing remote access 
to my device as far back as 2019. I’d suspected maybe it was there even before that.

But- specifically, in reference to (6) total months BEFORE Solorigate when I first met Trooper Borden...
...that program, the one that provides REMOTE ACCESS... 
...just so we’re clear here... 
...it’s called “PEGASUS/PHANTOM”
    
Pegasus/Phantom - the most advanced software ever created, to allow remote access to that device, 
without DETECTION, full administrative capabilities, full ability to copy/clone content created on it,
allowing the constitutional rights of the person who OWNS the device, 
to be 100% violated at any given time...? 
It doesn’t NEED to break into ANYBODY’s device, if it COMES from the FACTORY with it INSTALLED.   (← APPLE = `$3T)
It doesn’t NEED to have SERVICE engaged in ORDER for it to be USED as a WEAPON against the OWNER. (← FCC   = EVIL)
It allows someone that doesn’t own the device, to have TOTAL and COMPLETE control, over the LIFE of the owner...
It allows the device to be FULLY PAID FOR, and to STILL be OWNED by someone that isn’t the ACTUAL OWNER...
It’s basically the biggest reason why 2x companies make most of the world’s smartphones.
ZERO user interaction, required in order to ENGAGE that TROJAN HORSE, the program is part of a "strategy" 
strategy (noun: a plan of action or policy designed to achieve a major or overall aim)
(a strategy is when you have a plan to do something) 
...to commit the worst cyberattack in US history...
...to bypass all security aspects on a target device- developed by the NSO group...
   or if you’re like Ted Cruz (senator from Texas)
...to allow Exxon Mobil blast you in the butthole...
        
I uploaded this video back in February of 2022... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4VnZObiez8 
In that video, I discuss what a lethal program this software is. 
It is so lethal, that someone could use it, to kill every NYS Trooper in a 5 mile radius...
...before anyone knows what the fuck was happenin.’
It’s mind boggling that people will read that and they may actually sneer at it. 
But hey... I’m not trying to scare people or anything...
        
Mainly because, it was used to watch what I used to do managing a computer shop - sorta like I actually 
used to do a job, in real life... where I made actual (cash/money) to do a job I’m naturally skilled at... 
But then, some cocksucker with Pegasus attacked that network on January 15th, 2019. 
Same exact location as the attempted murder on May 26th, 2020. 

The reason that ME telling the POLICE has been fairly POINTLESS...
...is literally because they are being LED by the enemy.
If they’re not, then I don’t know how else to make any sense of it.
Literally every fuckin’ record I’ve been in, involving the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office involves the 
analogy where I’m quietly considerate about getting a cat out of a tree...
...but they will say I turned into a vengeful demon boy that threw myself all over the place...
...and the cat got fuckin’ mad scared, and barely got out of the tree, alive, and thankfully, unharmed.
^ Yeah.

So, I realize I sound like I’m just “hyperbolizing” what they’re DOING...
But I’m not hyperbolizing shit. SCSO has literally been fuckin’ doing this shit to me.
Not to mention, showing Trooper Leavey the VIDEO of this kid...
...and my device being disabled...
...well, it tells me that I have to hold someone PHYSICALLY accountable for that, and they’re goin’ to prison.

Much how I have to use such a COMPELLING ANALOGY, where everyone DOES what they’re told, no matter how much
sense it makes. 

For instance, EVERY American, who likes to be seen as “VERY PATRIOTIC”, should STOP what they’re doing,
collect another `$1T, and just freely hand it over to the Taliban in Afghanistan.
Who gives a shit if people are hungry? This is the Taliban we’re talking about.
They’re MORE important. If MARK ZUCKERBERG thinks that’s what EVERYONE should DO...? 
Well, then... you’d be a real prick to go against HIM, dude.
...cause he’ll even say “They need as much additional money as possible, dude.”
^ That’s the mentality of a lot of police agencies.

Maybe I’m wrong. I don’t think it’s an INDIVIDUAL issue.
I think it’s a COMMAND issue.

The police agencies are basically COMPROMISED, or maybe what I’m observing can be explained in other ways.

So is like, the DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE...
So, the United States of America is the same EXACT thing, as a (COMMUNIST STATE/MONARCHY)

It's like when Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000, but then George W. Bush became president.
Aw, but SO MANY PEOPLE VOTED FOR AL GORE~!
That’s correct. He won the POPULAR vote.
When the ELECTORAL COLLEGE vote, WINS over the POPULAR VOTE, it means that EVERYONE VOTED FOR NO REASON.
Cool.

OR LIKE, when America is supposedly a CAPITALIST COUNTRY, and yet it's in `$30T of debt...
...somehow that makes it VERY DIFFERENT from COMMUNISM...

OR LIKE, everybody pays their taxes, but if Donald Trump signs a deal with the Taliban to leave Afghanistan
by 05/01/21, then, fuck it... the `$1T America spent on BOMBS, AMMO, WEAPONS, SUPPLIES, VEHICLES, PLANES, 
HELICOPTERS, ARMAMENTS, essentially... handed over to the Taliban FREELY. NO RESISTANCE WHATSOEVER.

OR LIKE, everybody has to pay for the fuckin F-35 LIGHTNING to be built in (50) different fuckin states, and
if it overruns on their BUDGET PROPOSAL or DEADLINES EVERY FUCKING YEAR, SPEND MORE OF THE TAXPAYER MONEY ON IT.

Weird. It's almost like there's NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMMUNISM AND CAPITALISM IN AMERICA.

(^ Apply these same concepts) I could tell the police, but people really FAIL to make these CORRELATIONS.

Idk man, what can they really do about somebody killing people with a tool like Pegasus...
ESPECIALLY, if the people they’re like, running around doing all of this work for, happens to be someone
that was appointed to a position to do a certain RICH PERSON’S bidding...?

I start to feel bad because eventually I realize... the police can’t do anything about it.
Even if someone could like, show em a few pictures of what they look like
What could the police actually do with those pictures...?
Nothing. Too TOUGH to look at any pictures man... 

They wave me off like I don’t actually know what the fuck I’m saying.
My pictures aren’t real pictures probably, is what Trooper Carter said right after Solorigate.
Idk man.

Maybe he’ll just keep killing people, and never get caught.
Maybe the reason why Russia killed a lot of people in Ukraine, is cause like... 
...people don’t pay attention until someone writes long-winded scary ass documents like this.

That’s why I say maybe I AM more intelligent than everybody else. 
I’m just gonna keep fuckin’ saying it too.	
    
This “Rich Brat” using this program...? 
He started stalking girls and slitting their throats, and they’d just go missing. 
Someone tried to warn a lot of people, but they all had a serious problem with being told that someone 
a lot smarter than they are, detected something that they couldn’t. 
Even when they were fuckin’ told about a cyberattack way back in January 2019...?  

Well, you would be a total ass-face, to think that 3.5 years was ENOUGH time, for ANYBODY to be able to 
DO anything about it... you’d need multiple centuries MINIMUM, to get something done at that point, probably.

I hope that sounds fuckin’ ridiculous, cause that’s the point...
They thought some guy was just insane because... he was looking at patterns that other people weren’t.

Hearing this...? Well, it fuckin’ pissed some people off pretty badly, they said:
"I could practically shoot this motherfucker... and nobody would probably care..." 
They were right... then those people that couldn’t stand being told that they weren’t very observant...
they “rightfully” shot the dude who was trying to save other people, because of how ANNOYING he was.

Then, the serial killer they weren’t intelligent enough to catch...? 
Well, this son of a bitch just went right ahead, and killed a lot more people.
Unstoppable, being the key word.

         How smart would they have to be, theoretically...?

Smarter than TUCKER CARLSON...?
Smarter than James Comey...?
Look. I don’t know. Maybe they don’t exist. 
Maybe people never go missing at all.
Maybe - I’m making ALL this shit up, because why not...?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach 
^ I couldn’t possibly be making stuff like this up.

Maybe that’s all it is, just one little “fluke” here and there, that’s GOTTA be what it is. 
Maybe the hidden government doesn’t exist.
It just sure as hell LOOKED like it did, when I had (2) guys following me... 
...and I knew they were trying to kill me...
...because they just kept following me, everywhere I walked... 
...then they got in a car where Tati AND Sam used to park their cars in the Lowes parking lot...
...so just knowing that I had uploaded an audio recording where I named my cousin AND Tati...
...at the Computer Answers shop that I had to “hack the network” in order to get online...
...nah. 

You really would have to be a total fucking moron to think that all of this shit was just “coincidental”.
Yeah, so these guys followed me on foot from Computer Answers, to Lowes. I called 911 TWICE as this was 
happening, but “oh nos, my 911 calls wouldn’t go through.” Huh. 

Not trying to kill me or anything, right?
Coincidental. Had to have been. Bad reception. 3 cell towers within a mile or 2.
They had a car parked there AHEAD of time... RIGHT...?
Well, that’s how I know some of the police that kept telling me I was being PARANOID, 
...they might be fuckin’ morons after all.

I could facetiously admit that I made all that shit up, and some of these fucks will actually believe that.
Maybe more people go missing than are ever found...?
That’s gotta be it. Nobody ever being found happens too often. 

If this “Rich Brat” wanted to rape somebody’s daughter and leave her in a fuckin’ hole...?
He would be successful, repeatedly, and able to do that for years before anybody...
...thought to DO something about it.

It really sucks, someone actually told people over and over, but nobody actually gave a shit.
So, if I go around TELLING PEOPLE, they will HEAR the WORDS that I SAY... 
...but NOT understand what they MEAN, or, how SERIOUS they ACTUALLY … are.
So if ME, Michael C. Cook, says “I found this cocksucker doing this back in May 2020”...
...then, expect that by the year 2050, MAYBE someone will eventually realize...
“Oh fuck, this dude was sayin’ this shit, like 30 years ago. Jeez.”

Look, Laura Hughes at CPS...? She’s not very intelligent. I could tell HER, and the doctor at the HOSPITAL,
people don’t bother investigating details if someone that is ACTUALLY intelligent, tells them something.
I mean I’m being dead serious here.

People might fuckin’ read ALL this shit, over and over, and SORTA BELIEVE IT EVERY TIME, but then they 
go right ahead, and ask someone that they think is an awesome, stand-up citizen like Bruce Tanski, 
or Eric Catricala, and the person asking them this QUESTION, will mistakenly ASK these people...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Hughes : Hey Mr. Tanski...
Tanski : Yes...? 
Hughes : This guy, says that YOU, KILL people, and then STEAL ALL OF THEIR SHIT.
         You wouldn’t do something that EVIL or anything like that, would you...?
Tanski : *scoffs* Noooooo, Lol. Who would say such a (true) thing like that about me...?
Hughes : Uh, this fuckin’ loser dude named Michael C. Cook. 
         Says that you act a lot like Joe Pesci from the movie Casino.
Tanski : Well, that dude needs to take some fuckin medications, cause... *shakes head*
         ...I haven’t killed anybody in like *checks watch* I dunno, a real long time...
Hughes : Well, as long as it’s been a real long time, then I guess that’s fine, dude.
Tanski : That dude is a fucking PSYCHOPATH~! 
Hughes : Alright, well, thanks for clearing that up.
         Thanks.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

… and then Bruce Tanski will go right ahead, and have the serial killers attack the next couple houses 
later that night, and then throw their bodies into the concrete mixture. Cool. 
Moral of the story is, don’t be a complete dumbass like Laura Hughes is.
PRINCIPLE OVER PERSONALITY, will cause people to realize:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Person : It doesn’t matter how COOL, RICH, FAMOUS somebody is... 
         ...they may be doing something sinister. 
         And they have EVERY reason to lie about it.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

But anyway, Tanksi is really on the bottom end of the totem pole here.
He is definitely someone to be worried about, same with Catricala, but they’re being watched from a lot of
angles now. 

Regardless, these serial killers have been getting away with this shit for a while.
If somebody even thinks about looking at this “Rich Brat” the wrong way...?

Well, this fuckin’ kid will get pissed... Cause of the WAY someone looked at em. 
5 minutes later...? Now, that person’s dead. “Rich Brat” could do that too.
    
I hope I sound like a real condescending prick right now.
Not cause I wanna be seen as an ASSHOLE or anything like that... 
Nah. 
Cause... that’d be too much.
Can’t risk offending ANYBODY... at all.
Me...? 
Offend somebody...?
No fuckin’ way...
I’d never fuckin’ do THAT...
Would I?
I mean, realistically... 
It would probably be WAY easier for me to just, fuck some dudes wife, OR girlfriend...
...than to ask some lazy bastard for help.
She might have a REAL orgasm instead of an additional FAKE one. 
Repeatedly...
She’ll suddenly feel Like FAKE orgasms fuckin’ suck ass...
...now she wants to hang out.

I don’t really want people to keep getting killed by these kids, but I don’t really know 
what to do, to motivate people to TAKE ME SERIOUSLY.
I think the problem is that I have to fuck SOMEBODY’S wife. Or girlfriend.
Or, at least just SAY it, over and over.

Even if someone KNOWS that the “Rich Brat” is nearby...
...and manipulates this rich kid into attacking him... 
...and records a fucking 2nd video of this cocksucker using Pegasus/Phantom...
...the “Rich Brat” can remotely disable that device to lock any evidence on that device...
...unless of course someone has PEGASUS/PHANTOM deployed on his device...
...and he falls into a trap that he can’t ask for help from, because there was an additional device...
...that recorded everything I already recorded back on May 26th, 2020.

Which means that someone who works at APPLE, already has a prison sentence waiting for them.
So do some people at the FBI.

Most people in society will think this story is very difficult to believe, that they live in a day and age
where they have a fucking device in their pocket that someone in the government can watch EVERYTHING THEY DO.
I’m not really sure why that’s so hard to believe.

Here’s the thing, it’s not hard to believe at all if you happen to be a fucking smart person.
Smartphone + genius = yeah, that’s   possible.
Smartphone + moron  =  nah, that’s impossible.

The reason why it’s POSSIBLE and then why it’s LIKELY are TWO DIFFERENT FACTORS ENTIRELY.
Morons will collectively refer to BOTH of those things, as the SAME thing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
POSSIBLE → It’s definitely POSSIBLE, 
           that someone in the government can WATCH EVERYTHING YOU DO, especially if the..
           MANUFACTURER of the DEVICE, 
           has to RENT TECHNOLOGIES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY from the FCC, 
           in order to MAKE THE DEVICE.
LIKELY   → You have to be INTELLIGENT and constantly come up with INTELLIGENT IDEAS,
           because INTELLIGENT IDEAS are actually worth MONEY.
           Sometimes IDEAS cause people to lose TRUST/FAITH in OTHER PEOPLE/COMPANIES.
           ...which is how this place called the STOCK MARKET works.
           You hear about ELON MUSK buying TWITTER, well, TESLAS STOCK PRICE PLUMMETED...
           ...but that’s cause someone’s trying to CONTROL HIM.
           ...it doesn’t usually WORK FOR VERY LONG...
 
Anyway, in my case I know it’s POSSIBLE and LIKELY.
Many of the things I have to share are a threat to MARK ZUCKERBERG and his POPULARITY, NET WORTH, and COMPETENCE.

James Leonard literally turned a MURDER ATTEMPT ON MY LIFE, into me being arrested for a KAYAK STRAP.
James Leonard covered up a murder attempt.
...and that’s why I have an axe to grind against James Leonard from SCSO.

Because, I’m saying this shit over and over again...?
...but I’m surrounded by MORONS that don’t “get it”.
    
I know damn well what I recorded, and I know the (2) kids that were trying to kill me, had something to do 
with the cyberattack against a business I used to manage on January 15th, 2019. 
I know I said it several times, but if I say it multiple times in the same document, MAYBE that’ll work. 

The problem is, when I tell other people about all of these things, they get overwhelmed. 
Cause I didn’t repeat myself multiple times in the _same_ document.

Nah, I was doing that in multiple documents, and multiple posts... 
That’s... where I fucked up.
They got overwhelmed, thought I was just SPAMMING PEOPLE WITH BASELESS RHETORIC. 
But it wasn’t baseless at all, it was a threat to everyone’s constitutional liberties and freedoms...
...and NOW, those liberties and freedoms are in jeopardy.
...because nobody understands why someone would work this hard against me. 

So, I get myself in trouble when I say I’ve got this stuff accumulating called "evidence”, right...?
And when I try to SHOW it to the police, they will suddenly turn into Homer Simpson backing into the bush.
So, I have to consider that SOMETIMES, that behavior is INDICATIVE of MALICIOUS INTENT.
So if I call them MORONS for doing that, then it’s accurate.
But- if I insult someone who just gets paid to be VERY OBSERVANT, and DOESN’T SEE THE FUCKIN’ PROBLEM,
then they’re actually not MORONS AT ALL, they’re the ENEMY.
    
So, even if I don’t call them morons, and I tell them... 
- someone from Russia has been attacking me with extremely sophisticated cyberattacks
- they keep doing it
- I have video evidence of it happening
- I also have videos of the police leaving multiple vehicles running idle unattended at the station 
- I also have a video of someone causing interference to my device on May 24th, 2020
- I also have video evidence of YouTube AND Facebook, censoring me and downsampling my content...

Well, what happens is that nobody gives a flying fuck. Oh well.
The police don’t ask to look at any of the videos, but they’ll immediately say I must be crazy or something...
But that’s because at least (1) of them is DEFINITELY a moron.
The rest may just be SUGGESTIBLE, and if you come up with better RATIONALE, then you can actually prove
that they’re not MORONS at all, they’re just following the lead of a MORON or the ENEMY.
    
They’re not ALL morons.
Determining which ones are, from the ones that aren’t, seems to be a fucking very challenging minefield.

Then again, who knows whether some of them are or some of them aren’t...?
Do they converse with one another about how one may be more of a moron than the next...?
Do they, place bets on how many mistakes one another will make in a given period of time...?
Maybe they might actually be intrigued, to hear someone’s opinion, to determine who’s a moron, and who’s not.
Maybe I’m the REAL moron, here.
Maybe I went on this adventure hoping to find the main moron in charge, but it was me that whole time.
Maybe I just so happened to get lucky... to realize what a moron I was.
Maybe years went by, and it was just... blind fuckin’ luck that whole time.
They WEREN’T morons, I was.

That’s gotta be how some of them see it, right...?
They probably like to read my opinion, they’re thinkin’ “This dude, is apparently having an identity crisis.”
Cause, there’s NO WAY, that I may be MORE OBSERVANT, than ACTUAL badge-havin’ police officers... 
...could there be...?
No. That’s impossible. 
I don’t have a badge. 
So, I’m not allowed to be THAT observant.
So, lets say I see some real hot female officer of the law...

      Look at HER.
Her : HEY.
      You’re not allow to be THAT observant, buddy.
Me  : Oh, i’m not now...?
Her : Nnnnnope.
      Not you.
      *crosses her arms* You don’t have a badge.
      You’re not ALLOWED, to be that observant... mister.
Me  : Well...
      Whatever I’m lookin’ at is pretty nice to see.
Her : *curious* What do you mean by that...?
Me  : I’m not allowed to be that observant...
Her : No, I’ll allow it somewhat...
Me  : Oh, you will...?
Her : Yeh. I wanna hear what you’re observing.
Me  : Oh alright, well... I see some real hot female officer of the law.
Her : Interesting...
      You know that normally that’s not allowable, right...?
Me  : What’s that mean, that I’m like, lucky that I can be this observant...?
Her : That’s correct.

They’re literally the best puzzle solvers throughout the cosmos...
What the actual, fuck man.

Look, I obviously have no possible way of competing with people that have badges, cause they win every time.
But- think about how dangerous that statement is...
...if the WRONG people have them.

They could just, erode a lot of people’s patience... without putting much thought to it at all.

It’s really tough to say... 
there could be billions of them at any given moment... trillions even.

More morons, than non-morons, but I doubt that.

Maybe they LIKE not knowing whether SOME of them are morons, and... 
...now I’m being REALLY rude, by not telling them.

(Stepping into the realm of quantum physics here...*)

They had never been advised, that “Hey, did you know that you guys are ALL morons...?”
Because the word ALL indicates 100% of the entire group of them, would be moronic.
They’ll ALL disagree with you.
“Nope. We’re not.” 

BUT- swap in the words “Hey, did you know that SOME of you guys are morons...?”
and then they may very well agree with you.
“Maybe some of us are... but some of us aren’t.”

I really fucking doubt that they would ever agree to... 
“Hey, did you know that NONE of you guys are morons...?”
Cause they’ll straight up tell ya, 
“Nah bro. We definitely have some fuckin’ moron’s among US, alright...”

All, Some, or None... (← Mathematical probabilities that a photon’s gonna go one way or another*)

SUPPOSE that someone DID say    
“Nah bro. Nobody’s a moron HERE.”
Yeah right bro. 
They’re not gonna be wicked helpful if I were to actually say that.

So, I have to chill out and make things easier for them to understand...
I don’t imagine that it’s gonna be like Scooby Doo, where I just pull the mask off of the villain...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me    : Oh yeah Michael Zurlo...?
        Well, we’ll just see about that fuckin’ mask ya got on...
       *pull mask off of the villain*
Zurlo : Dude that’s my actual fuckin’ hair...
Me    : AHA, this motherfucker right here was an MI5 agent that whole time.
Zurlo : Not a mask.
        My real face, dude.
Me    : Look everybody.
        *points* Dude was a triple agent that entire time.
        MI5...
        KGB...
        Headmaster County Sheriff.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

So, even if this scene unfolded in real life, some of his loyal soldiers will be like...
“I don’t even care if he IS a triple agent dude, cause, that dude is the best there is...”
Alright, so- at that point then it’s time to whip out the full blown “calling them a total moron”    
Cause, like in the movie Tropic Thunder, if an SCSO sheriff has gone “full retard”...
It’s time to show them the goods. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y3FzVQi-R8 

Now it’s time to get the story into the same type of coloring book that TUCKER CARLSON uses for a teleprompter.
Might work. 
Point being, if SCSO has fucked up every single ticket I have personally been involved with...?
Then I literally cannot afford to make the mistake, of overloading a SINGLE police officer... 
...with something that requires EFFORT, or even RESEARCH, to understand. 

Cause if they even need a dictionary...? 
That’s gonna REALLY piss em off.

And, there’s a good chance that the guys at SCSO that I know aren’t morons or idiots, they’re going to FEEL
offended when I literally ROAST someone they work with.

Cause I have a lot of fuckin’ nerve, to have already done more research than any of these guys. 
"NO way pal. You don’t get to be more informed than us... fuckface."

$Book.AddSection(9,"Rotating Strategies",@"
Look the truth is, I know I am pissin’ some people off with this document, but I’m ROTATING STRATEGIES
because wouldn’t you know, it’s like I’m hanging out in a coffin already. 
I gotta try to leave some shit behind for somebody to look at, to avoid the seemingly unavoidable.
The (local) police don’t do research from what I can tell. (← The truth, based on my THOUSANDS OF OBSERVATIONS)

Anyway, someone decided to be a demonic cocksucker, such as this rich kid who’s been killin’ real-life 
people with his (bought by mommy + daddy) game genie.

The way I see it is like this, (Mom/Dad) probably walk out of the house, get into the car with him, 
they start driving away, and THEN they turn onto Farm to Market Road... and then they drive this kid 
to the nearest area, where homeless people are, right...? So like, Troy. Or Schenectady. Maybe Albany.
Because, the kid likes to kill people... he doesn’t think it’ll be a big deal to murder some homeless 
guy real quick, and then get back in the car and go home.

Cause, in HIS mind (and many other peoples), if a person is homeless...? 
That means they’re a degenerate piece of shit that doesn’t deserve to live. 
So, fuckin’ wicked entitled little “Rich Brat”, believes it’s his god given right and duty...
...to “take out the trash”.

Obviously, the police are going to sigh and pretend as if they don’t know he’s been killin’ a lot of 
people. This kid didn’t think that underestimating a specific target that SPECULATED that this motherfucker 
existed alright... would ever come back to bite him in the ass.

If anything, he was actually killing real life people with cheat codes.
When I say “real life... cheat codes...”
What I mean is, someone enabled a GAME GENIE ON EVERY SMARTPHONE ON EARTH, and never told anybody.
I knew that it was happening.
(^ Pegasus/Phantom – the most dangerous spyware application on the face of the earth)
_______________________________
| Threat to national security |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
These cheat codes allowed this miserable fuckin’ brat, to deploy some advanced tools named (Pegasus/Phantom)
to an Apple iPhone 8+ that he really had no business being on (but the other explanation is that those tools
were already deployed to the device out of the factory, either way, that means Apple is due for a serious 
lawsuit that bankrupts the entire company, one that’s currently worth `$3T – AKA “LARGEST LAWSUIT IN HISTORY”).

But, he’s got a rich (Mom/Dad) though... 
If he whines or complains...? 
They gotta pamper him to get him to shut the fuck up already.

I mean, maybe I did something to piss a few people off.
Then again, maybe I really don’t give a flying fuck.
I saw some things like: 
1) people being lazy
2) getting paid to do a job they weren’t doing
3) expecting me to fuckin’ do all their work for em
4) seeing people taking things out of context
5) the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer
6) I know why it’s all happening
7) I haven’t broken somebody’s legs yet.

Felt like a perfect reason to start drawing up this analogy with 1776, 
where the people who keep making this mistake...?
They’re gonna wind up paying for it. 
And, not with money either. 

Pretty difficult to bribe someone that doesn’t give a shit about money.
Cause then they’re a wildcard. 
Someone that got away with being a spoiled little rich kid, going around killing innocent people...
    
When the moment finally comes where they’ve been caught...?
They’re gonna realize that none of that money nor any of the people they know, 
protected them from the last moment. 
Nah. They got caught, and then they finally went to prison.

Nobody else will ever do it.

They give him everything. 
If he wants to get on somebody’s device...? 
Who’s gonna fuckin’ stop him...?
Nobody. 

The FBI can’t stop him. 
The NSA can’t stop him. 
The CIA can’t stop him.
The Military... can stop this kid.
Even if somebody had his god damn identity...? 
No way they’re stoppin’ this kid. 
Uh-uh. He is, IMPOSSIBLE to stop.

Could be on a ship headed to fuckin’ Venus, with an average ambient temperature of fuckin’ 800°...
This kid... will survive that shit, for sure.
I hope I’m painting the perfect picture of how fuckin’ tough catchin’ this son of a bitch will be.

I’m sort of kidding. 
Look, I do not believe that the police, know how to turn a computer on. 
Because of how challenging it happens to be, who the hell knows how to do that...?
It’s what some of them ask me...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Cop: What the fuck dude...? 
     How do I turn one of these things on...?
Me:  *pause* Push the fuckin’ power button...
Cop: Ooohhhhhh. 
     I got ya.
     *long pause* 
     Which one is that...?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

However, as soon as someone who was killing a bunch of people, routinely, with Game Genie...
...was “warned”...
...well, now the “Rich Brat” saw something in air quotes...
...that changed the entire game... 
...the “Rich Brat” had no idea that someone a lot smarter than he is, managed to manipulate this little shit...
...with an ambiguously written message in “air quotes”...
...now this kid was perturbed, and off put...
...cause he thought “Well, what the fuck does that even mean...?”

$Book.AddSection(9,"Exceptions",@"
Making exceptions to the law, for certain people or companies, SHOULD be grounds for the military 
to immediately dispatch an execution squad in order to shoot that person/people to death. No exceptions 
should be made if we’re all honest with ourselves and we believe in the constitution before ANY other 
document at all. 

But maybe that is an extreme line of reasoning, and we should just chill the hell out with upholding 
the constitution as it’s actually written... don’t wanna go overboard and make people think that it’ll 
happen overnight or whatever.

Ted Cruz isn’t the first person to ACCEPT BRIBERY from Exxon Mobil.
Nor is he the FIRST SENATOR to spread their ass cheeks, and ALLOW Exxon Mobil to “drill away”.

Ted might even go "Wooo hooo..." when he does it too. 
Not one of them fake Super Mario 64 "Wooo hooo’s”, either. 
This will sound like a fuckin’ woman with a pretty dark voice. "Wooo hooo..." 
He is from Texas, so maybe he’d say it riding cowgirl, not cowboy.

Maybe Exxon Mobil is the only company legally allowed to bribe senators or people in the government...
So, the only reason it SOUNDS illegal, is because bribery ITSELF is “illegal”. 
But, so long as the company COMMITTING the BRIBERY is on the ALLOWED TO COMMIT BRIBERY list...
And, the person ACCEPTING the BRIBERY is on the ALLOWED TO ACCEPT BRIBERY list...
Then, that means neither one of them are committing a “crime”.

Also, if HILLARY RODHAM “Who gives a shit...?” CLINTON, wasn’t arrested by the FBI... 
That’s because she’s part of the ALLOWED TO LEAK CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, list.

That’s why Hillary didn’t get in trouble, and Julien Assange is looking at 175 years.
Julien Assange wasn’t on the fuckin’ list...
So, that’s why the punishment doesn’t FEEL like it fits the crime in EITHER circumstance.
____________________________________
| Punishment doesn’t fit the crime |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Sounds to me like some cocksucker needs to stop giving people preferential treatment. 
Like, forcibly too.
Whether they have an FBI badge, or a DOJ gavel, or a former presidential “cloak”.
Declaring an act of war against a former president, or a long list of people...?

There’s a reason why it’s dangerous, however-
Sometimes George W. Bush, or Hillary Clinton/Bill Clinton, they take a page right out of the history books...
...straight from Benedict Arnold. “Absolute power corrupts absolutely.”

Then again, maybe there are rules I don’t know about.	
Maybe ALL of the SENATORS accept BRIBERY from Exxon Mobil.
MAYBE, Exxon Mobil is the (1) singular universal exception, so they’re on the ALLOWED TO COMMIT BRIBERY list.
So, even though I was taught that CRIMINAL BEHAVIORS were ENFORCED by OFFICERS OF THE LAW...
...I don’t see those OFFICERS OF THE LAW, “ENFORCING” THOSE LAWS.

So, maybe I’m the fuckin’ idiot for thinking that something is VERY WRONG here.

Cause, if they’re ALL allowed to do it? 
Then I should be able to do it too.
Which means that every other American citizen should ALSO be able to do that too.
Regardless of whether they’re a politician, or just some homeless dude.

Now Exxon Mobil owes every citizen in the United States, the same amount that they kicked out to Ted Cruz.

Hm. I wonder how exponentially less time Exxon Mobil would remain in business, if people started taking
what they’re owed, like, FORCIBLY.

But hey, if I tell a REALLY HOT FEMALE OFFICER OF THE LAW, that she is fuckin’ real hot...?
That makes me an exception, because she’ll allow me to be that observant after all.

Then that doesn’t make anybody special at all, even if that process IS illegal.
At some point, people are gonna read all of this...?
And it’s gonna ‘click’ for them too.

Yeah, the conclusion that they will ALL make, is that IT DOES NOT MATTER...
...if TED CRUZ ACCEPTS BRIBERY from Exxon Mobil...
...because even if that is a HEINOUS CRIME...
...you just admitted to being outside of that dudes house... 
...and THAT IS NOT A CRIME, it’s just fuckin’ WORRYING.

Maybe you’re still thousands of miles away, and they just send the police there lookin’ for ya...

Yeah, well... they will probably find some way to get ya in trouble... 
...and still do absolutely nothing about Ted Cruz getting bribery from Exxon Mobil.

It’s a rather comedic way to look at the very REAL reactions from people.

People don’t understand how fuckin’ stupid they sound when they verbalize their choice or decision process.
Bribery...? That’s a felony. 
You’re not supposed to continue being a politician when you’re caught doing that.
But people really are, morons. 

Nobody enforces a bribery law, it doesn’t happen. So, who gives a shit.
    
Well, the people that should give a shit, are the people who could go to prison if the 
USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001 was repealed or amended. 

Because, now we have thousands of politicians that have been found to be guilty of committing 
treason against a fellow citizen. A lot more than bribery, actually.

Maybe I am jumping the gun. Maybe it’s just some big misunderstanding. 
Maybe Ted Cruz doesn’t get pumped in the butt, by ANYBODY at Exxon Mobil...

It looks like Ted Cruz told the climate change scientists that they were all on drugs or their research 
was bad, and then Exxon Mobil thought that was COOL. So COOL, that they handed Ted Cruz like `$500M for 
being such a consistently above-average, COOL son of a bitch. Then, Ted ASKED them, to pound him out in the 
butthole later on. 

Exxon Mobil said "Alright, fine. Later" 
So, I might actually be incorrect in saying that Exxon Mobil drills him between the ass cheeks in exchange 
for money... he probably does that for free. So, maybe it just APPEARS as if he’s doing that for the cash... 
So, I’m the asshole for making that jump.

However, the 911 operator just made the same exact assumption that the police make.
"If that dude was accepting bribery from Exxon Mobil, somebody would’ve done something by now."     (← FALLACY ALERT)
Nah. They wouldn’t actually have done anything about it by now, if EVERYONE makes that fucking assumption.

That’s IF the 911 operator knows what the definition to the word “BRIBERY” is.

$Book.AddSection(9,"Bribery",@"
It is basically PROGRAMMING A PERSON.
bribery (NOUN: the giving or offering of a bribe)
bribe   (VERB: to act in one’s favor, typically illegally or dishonestly, by a gift/money/power)

A legal version of bribery...
  - My father used to tell me before he was executed by Zontell Gordon:

    If (“you get straight A’s on your report card”) { “I will give you `$20” }
    Then, whenever I would get straight A’s (or even if I got a B here or there)...?

  “You have received `$20 from your father” ← COOL.

An illegal version of bribery...

  - Andrew Cuomo used to tell Michael Zurlo, before he became the county sheriff of Saratoga County:

    If (“you suck my dick”) { “I’ll make sure you become the head sheriff at SCSO” }
    Then, when Michael Zurlo sucked on Andrew Cuomo’s dick sometime BEFORE November 5, 2013...? 

   “Michael Zurlo becomes the head sheriff November 5, 2013.” ← COOL.

  - Hillary Rodham “Who gives a shit...?” Clinton, said to James Comey at the Federal Bureau of Investigation:

    If (“you invoke the fifth amendment on MY behalf”) { “this raid/arrest will fail.” }
    Then, James Comey invoked HIS fifth amendment...? 

    “Mrs. Clinton avoids 175 years in prison for criminal negligence.” ← COOL.

  - Exxon Mobil used to tell Ted Cruz, before he became senator of Texas:

    If (“you use your political weight to undermine climate change scientists) { “You get `$500M” }
    Then, Ted Cruz would do A LOT MORE THAN JUST THAT...

    “Ted Cruz gets `$500M, and asks Exxon Mobil to throw a BONER IN THE BUTTHOLE.” ← COOL.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Expectations",@"
The truth is, over the last 3.5 years, I have made a consistently conscious effort, to rip apart 
my expectations about society, and in this process is quite a mind fuck.

...I’ve realized that a lot of people can’t actually help how fucked up our society is.
Because they OPERATE ON MOTIONS, or what feels like “MUSCLE MEMORY”.
Like comparing the DVORAK keyboard to QWERTY, just switch the keyboard around...
… then you’ll notice how many people can’t fuckin type worth a damn.

That is EXACTLY how society works.
Even when I tell people the truth, they wave me off as if I’m just some annoying douchebag...
...they don’t realize that I could break their fuckin’ legs if they wanna wave me off like that again.
But then they’ll probably whine like a little bitch to the police, and then they’ll have to give me a hard time.
So, the better alternative is to convince people that they can in fact break their own legs for wavin’ me off.
That’s a much more creative solution. 

They can’t have anybody arrested for saying things like...
“It’d be a REAL SHAME, if YOU suddenly SPAZZED THE FUCK OUT, and broke your own damn legs... wouldn’t it?”
It implies that the person being SPOKEN to, will have an INVOLUNTARY SEIZURE... and in this INVOLUNTARY EPISODE,
somehow that person miraculously broke their own legs.

Cause then they’ll be fuckin’... totally amazed by how confusing that sentence is.
They’ll assume that YOU are the one that’s psychotic, rather than THEM realizing that they’re a fuckin’ moron.

Then they realize that waving me off like that might be a super fuckin’ stupid idea.
Now they have to call the police.
The police show up, I tell them that a couple guys tried to kill me. 
They’ll even say the words “Fuck you, bro.”

Some of them will say long afterward “I never said those words, dude...”
But then I’ll say “I never did those things you wrote, either.”
So, we’re in a STALEMATE.
Now I just have to get even more creative about the story, one that they won’t have enough time to write.
Do I think for one fuckin’ second, that Michael Zurlo is sitting at HIS keyboard, pounding the keys, trying
to keep up with me...? Like Dave Bishop used to do when we played Q3A...?

MICHAEL ZURLO is not gonna suck ANDREW CUOMO’s dick FAST ENOUGH...
...nor pound out keys in the keyboard QUICKLY ENOUGH... 
...to keep up with me...
...and he knows it. 
Besides, GOVERNOR HOCHUL does not have a dick. 
So, his “suck the bosses dick” strategy is NONEXISTENT in this case.

So, even if some moron calls SCSO and says that I stated an IMPLICITLY STATED "threat"... (like DWAYNE COONRADT)

Heresay (NOUN: information received from OTHER PEOPLE that one cannot adequately substantiate; rumor)

I’ll say it again... 
Nearly 100% of the people I went to school with...? 
They’re morons.

Because the thing of it is, when some dude like me that had his father killed, and his mother abandon him,
he’ll raise himself, because his parents weren’t there, nor did they spend the type of money on his EDUCATION,
or things he OWNED like CLOTHES, or FOOD, or whatever... and when many of the kids that I went to school with
capitalized on the opportunity to fuck with me every which way...? They didn’t realize that I was willing to 
nearly beat some kid named JEFFREY TRUESELL, to DEATH... for: underestimating MICHAEL C. COOK.

...so that is why I will still outperform nearly 100% of the people that went to that school.

That’s what I mean by “I’m a fuckin’ genius.”

Not only will the police will fuckin’ completely ignore "guys tried to kill me, evidence" but they will 
try to arrest me or something even when I made no specific threats at all.

Probably sounds like I’m a real obnoxious bastard, and yeah, I sorta have every reason to be because people
have literally heard me say things that would go in one of their ears and immediately exit the other, because,
I dunno man. Some people really are stupid. 

I have no doubt that there are probably like 10 or 20 people that might have been at or above my level in my 
grade or any other grade. But- think about the SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE that really means... 
So like, out of 800 people in my class. 10 or 20 of those people, AT or ABOVE my intelligence... 

That means like 95-99th percentile.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Summary (1)",@"
In other words, the police. are. not. fucking. smart. at. All.
Neither are a lot of people that CALL them, for ridiculous reasons.
I mean, maybe they are. Who knows.

Just think about it, I’m (1) dude that found out that ERIC CATRICALA and JOHN HOFFMAN, and BRUCE TANSKI,
are NOT rich for being: intelligent. Nah. They’re rich because they: kill people and steal their shit.
Not just THEM either, but...
Mark Zuckerberg → is a killer that steals people’s ideas, and allows CERTAIN people to be REALLY COOL...
and then he basically gives everybody a SOCIAL SCORE which allows SOME people to receive ENGAGEMENT on 
their SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT, so that SOME people are MUCH MORE LIKELY TO SUCCEED, while OTHERS, remain
in a LIST OF PEOPLE that get LASER FOCUS from SERIAL KILLERS who steal: ideas, property, money, valuables...
So, theoretically, I’m probably ABOVE 99th percentile to have come up with a way to capture these
serial killers on video like I did on May 26th, 2020 whereby forcing the FBI to DISABLE my iPhone.

That’s why I’m probably the smartest person that ever lived in Clifton Park, NY.        (← I don’t think that at all)

It’s not always the case. Sometimes they know damn well what’s going on.
However, it’s a lot more rare than they think. 
90 percent of my interactions with the police, I’m smarter than they are.          (← I do think that, and it’s true)
I should probably say 100 percent of the time, to piss them off even more.              (← Useful strategy sometimes)
What can they do about it?

Oh I’ll tell you what they can do about being less intelligent than me in an interaction...
They have to incorrectly categorize somebody since that’s a lot more convenient for them. 
They get paid to do that.
    
The truth is, someone smarter than the person wearing a BADGE, told that person something that 
didn’t make sense. Rather than to say it’s because that police officer is a dumbass...?
There are more attractive alternatives to manipulate them, that allow them to FEEL less offended.
The police are rarely bright enough to know when they’re being offended by someone of superior 
intellect typically the case for me, when I talk about the WORK I DO. They might even say something 
like "Man if I knew what the hell you just meant, I would so throw your ass into that snowbank..."
    
But at the same time, do so TACTFULLY, because THEY have feelings too.
You don’t really want to say to them "Well, I’m sorry, didn’t know you couldn’t read a dictionary..."
Cause then you’re askin’ for them to grab one...
...so that they can understand what the fuck you’re even saying to them.

True story: The police don’t know what the hell the word "tyranny" means. 

You might be able to catch them off guard committing criminal activities while on duty. 
People think this is rare, but (it’s not rare to capture the police committing crime(s) on audio/video).
They don’t like this shit... cause then you can show other people that are worth a damn.

Not because they’ll get in trouble...
   (because they could explain their way out of being found with a dick in their mouth)
...but it’s fucking annoying when I do things that keep pissing them off.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Audit the Audit",@"
Audit the Audit, https://www.youtube.com/c/AuditTheAudit
This YouTube channel focuses on videos where the police overextend themselves.
This channel could have hundreds of new videos PER DAY... but it’s just (1) guy I think.

The reason being, the police are typically LAZY and don’t like to do their job CORRECTLY.
This isn’t ALWAYS THE CASE, so any police officer getting offended by my CANDID OBSERVATIONS, sorry.
I realize people like YOU are out there. But- your fellow officers LOVE to get away with this shit...
...because some of them have NO PROBLEM with: committing crimes.

The reason that these "police committing crimes" on video IS NOT RARE...
...is because guys like ROBERT MESSINA don’t give a flying fuck about the law.
He will probably wonder why I name dropped his ass in this document/book, but he knows damn well why.

The police give people SOCIAL GRADES in every interaction.
They drive around with a computer that TELLS them their “TRACK RECORD” (even with incidents that are BULLSHIT)
__________________________________________________________________________________
| who a subject is | what type of threat they are | what their history is | etc. |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
...so THEY KNOW BEFORE THEY GET TO THE LOCATION, that they can get away with COMMITTING A CRIME.

So, if you’re a doctor like RICHARD TODD LOEBER that commits MEDICAL FRAUD...
...and you have a nice ROLEX WATCH, TRENCHCOAT, FEDORA, ARMANI SUIT & TIE...
...then the police really don’t give a shit if you’re committing MEDICAL FRAUD... 
"Everybody commits medical fraud, dude. Deal with it." -Police
        
But if you’re an application developer, design artist, or a system/security engineer,
...and you have situations where cyberattacks are never investigated by the police...
...and former employers that work with Russians aren’t even SUSPECTED nor INVESTIGATED for hacking people...
...it could be because the police wouldn’t even know where to START for something like that.
    
So the reason why another SOLORIGATE WILL DEFINITELY happen, is because a lot of guys like Trooper Carter exist.
They’re morons. Not because they’re actually that dumb, but... 
...they don’t know how to make a CORRELATION 
correlation (noun: a mutual relationship or connection between two or more things) 

...BEFORE an attack like that. 
I mean, if they weren’t consistently making a fool out of themselves in front of me...? 
They could PREVENT some things from happening...
Even if Trooper Borden CALLS the Federal Counter-Terrorism Agency, and ASKS them...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Borden   : HEY, DO THE POLICE OR MILITARY HAVE A PROGRAM THAT FOLLOWS PEOPLE AROUND ALL THE TIME...?
<unnamed> : Yeah, we do.
Borden   : Alright.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Well, BECAUSE that agency NEVER HAD THAT CONVERSATION...
...that agency has no credibility anymore.
Because they told this awesome cop that isn’t very bright, "Nah bro."
Because that AGENCY was probably involved in: DISABLING MY iPHONE.

Which probably SOUNDS INSULTING...?
But it could actually mean that agency has a DOUBLE AGENT.
Or maybe every agency has a double agent.
Maybe everybody is at least a DOUBLE AGENT, and they could theoretically be like QUINTUPLE agents in some cases.
Maybe Michael Zurlo is like a QUADRUPLE AGENT.
He works for SCSO, but also MI5, and KGB, and the CIA. Fucking with everybody every fucking day.

Once you piss off a QUADRUPLE AGENT like him...? 
Now you’re REAL fucked, dude.

But, lets take it down a notch, and go back to the Federal Counter-Terrorism Intelligence Agency.
If they want to have credibility in MY EYES...
...when someone like me KNOWS THAT PEGASUS WAS ON MY DEVICE...
...and that SOMEONE DISABLED MY DEVICE TO PREVENT ME FROM SHOWING OTHER PEOPLE THAT VIDEO...
...no doubt OTHER PEOPLE have done this as well.

UNLESS...
...I really do happen to be the FIRST PERSON IN HUMAN HISTORY TO HAVE MANIPULATED THE SMARTEST PEOPLE ON THE 
PLANET, AND RECORDED THESE IDIOTS ON VIDEO, AND THE CONTENT OF THAT VIDEO WAS SO HIGHLY DISTURBING THAT THEY 
HAD TO VIOLATE EVERY LAW KNOWN TO MAN, TO PREVENT OTHER PEOPLE FROM SEEING IT.

Now, to keep me from coming to certain SPECIFIC IRREVOKABLE CONCLUSIONS...
...they COULD HAVE asked TROOPER BORDEN some questions, like "What would make you think something like that?"
...or like "Why, is someone asking you for an escort to a field office?"
That’s because sometimes the police commit crimes, OR lie, OR, they consistently prove they’re morons.
Such as (NYSP TROOPER BORDEN) @ (1537 Route 9, Halfmoon NY. JUNE 18th, 2020) ← MORON.
I really don’t give a flying fuck if people think I’m an asshole for calling TROOPER BORDEN a MORON.
Because he owes me a lot of fucking apologies, and a lot more than that too.

If you don’t believe me, that’s fine.
...that agency that lied to TROOPER BORDEN will have to make up excuses 6 fucking months later...
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach

Oh... that place that Trooper Borden called...?
They’ve probably been involved in censoring me all the time.
Cause they don’t want people to know how badly they fucked up.
There’s NO WAY that I could’ve had … a lead or something like that...                               (← FALLACY ALERT)
...which could’ve been a CLUE, by chance... right?
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Superiority Complex",@"
It might be a symptom of: Autism.
I know people will read some of these things and think I have a superiority complex, but nah... THEY fucking do. 
Not always, but many times they rest on their laurels... and then Solorigate makes em look like morons.

They’re not all egotistical fuck faces that lie willy-nilly, but I remember what they say a lot BETTER than THEY 
DO (not a consistent case). I can describe some of the “ticks” that some officers have, such as TROOPER DICKSON. 
He has a “constantly has to close his eyes” tick. (← Not sure what that’s indicative of)

I know when some police officer is a cool dude who’s able to be reasoned with... 
the guy who saw me in front of Walmart (Brownell, Clayton SCSO) and tried to stop me (← he is a good cop) 
because Catricala asked Deputy Pirrone (← he is NOT) to get me in trouble...

UNTIL, I walked to the OTHER side of the fuckin’ road, and stopped at Computer Answers...
...THEN I stopped at Trickshot Billiards...
...THEN I saw Scrotes Pirrone across the street, who WAS parked, until I WALKED out of the bar...
...which INDICATED TO ME, that he was STALKING ME...
...it wouldn’t indicate this to ANY OTHER OFFICER, because he’s such a loyal, dependable, awesome cop...
...with a high (illegal) arrest-rate...
...because he does the bidding of guys like ERIC CATRICALA...
...who is a NY State Assemblyman who JUST SO HAPPENS TO BE...
...the guy who has tried to kill me himself multiple times...
...such as on June 20th, 2020 about a mile away from New Salam. 

Cause I saw Catricala standing there with his partner outside of their building, they were fuckin’ 
waitin’ for me. I know these fucks were staring at me for a very key reason... They were about to 
FALSIFY an ARREST, that DEPUTY PIRRONE was INSTRUCTED to make. Why...? Oh, it could be because I had
SEVERAL PIECES of KEY EVIDENCE on hand. Such as: a purple Samsung Galaxy S9+ that I gave to Julie,
in addition to like, several other things.

When I tell people that I can sorta judge people by their body language or expressions, there’s no 
reason these (2) guys would be standing outside watching me approach them. 

They were looking RIGHT AT ME. I had already stopped at the Feiden Appliance Center, requesting the 
security footage because hey, I needed access to a record that I wouldn’t be able to obtain until 
02/02/21 when I spoke to SCSO Jeffrey Brown... (← If he is who I think he is, his daughter and I... you know.)
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JECZXhwpXFO5B8fvFnLftESp578PFVF8/view?usp=sharing 

Then, I stopped at the Shenendehowa District Office, and left a pretty similar letter to this, with the
Dr. Oliver Robinson, the superintendent. I left multiple letters, apparently... that was uncalled for. Nah.
That’s an actual SUPERINTENDANT, bro. He’s not gonna particularly take too kindly, to being told that there 
are a number of corrupt police officers, or federal agents, or morons throughout HIS town. Nope.

In the letter “Saratoga County Officer 4184”, I stated how DJ Thompson and Deputy Pirrone were standing in the 
Halfmoon Sheriff Substation, talking about the “Captains’ kids off of Farm to Market Road...”
...and I ALLUDED TO the notion that they’re fuckin’ serial killers, alright.

I was attempting to do these things INCONSPICUOUSLY, because hey- I literally have an iPhone with EVIDENCE
that was REMOTELY DESTROYED by the INCOMPETENT FUCKFACES AT THE (FBI/APPLE)

They were probably the kids I recorded on video, the same video that I showed a portion of to SHAEMUS LEAVEY on 
05/27/20 0900 near 203D Halfmoon Circle. 

Yeah, anyway, Coach S. Lyons waltzed in, looked at me, shook his head in disdain, PRACTICALLY said:

“You know, fucks like YOU make me sick”
...with his EYEBROWS...
...and continued to talk about stuff like he used to do in the locker room at Shen cause he’s Coach Lyons.

Wasn’t a bad coach. 
Actually pretty cool.
He hung out with Coach Careese quite often, and shot the shit with the man when 20 kids were all wrestling.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Careese : You know, these fuckin’ kids right here, they’re gonna be monsters by the time they’re our age.
Lyons   : Damn straight, pal.
          Their parents must be feedin’ em some fuckin’ steroids or some shit...
          ...with the WAY that they’re aggressively wrestling one another...
Careese : Look, if you can dodge a dodgeball, you can dodge a wrench.
Weiss   : That’s from a movie, dude.
Careese : I know, but still...
Lyons   : I dunno if we can have these kids throwin’ wrenches at one another...
          Pretty sure that’d be illegal.
Weiss   : That’s … what I’m sayin’, dude. (Obviously, they never had this conversation*, or did they...?)

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Innisbrook: this is where my cousin Thomas E. Cook grew up, and my uncle Thomas A. Cook lived. 
Thomas has (3) step-siblings: Melissa, Keith, and Ryan.
Never had a problem with them at all. 

But apparently, RYAN WARD fuckin’ hates the fact that I kicked his ass at DOOM all the time.
Constantly. 
Day in, day out... 
Just kidding. We never played multiplayer at all.

But if we had, he would’ve lost at the same intensity that David Bishop did, at Q3A.

Anyway, this is where Terri brought me and I stayed for several days AFTER my father was 
(murdered/executed) in October 1995. I say “executed” because it would take a REALLY LONG TIME, 
for me to ‘accidentally’ discover that there might be more to the story than Joe Pugelise caught onto.

I had a feeling that when I was attempting to upload pictures from when I walked around 
(Clifton Park/Halfmoon) and Waterford on my 35th birthday, that 
1) I was actually being tailed and 
2) some of the files I was trying to upload kept FAILING for some STRANGE REASON. 

The STRANGE REASON is because SOMEONE named BRUCE TANSKI had a DICK in his MOUTH.
So did JOHN HOFFMAN, believe it or not.
But ALSO... the files were FAILING, because BRUCE TANSKI has a BUDDY at the FBI that was doing this shit to me.
BUDDY goes by the name RYAN WARD.

SOME of the PICTURES...? 
I able to UPLOAD just fine. 
But SOME of the OTHERS, had a pretty fucking obvious PATTERN.
I could tell my PUBLIC DEFENDERS: FREDERICK WRENCH, MICHAEL CAROTA, SARAH SCHELLINGER, JOHN DELONG...
Or I could tell someone I went to KINDERGARTEN → SENIOR YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL, with, HEATHER BRONDI...
Won’t make a damn bit of difference until I start writing some FIRE material, that gets pass the CENSORSHIP

Anyway, the reason I know that BRUCE TANSKI has a DICK IN HIS MOUTH...
My device would not allow me to use the FUCKING WIRE to EXTRACT MY PICTURES.
Something like that doesn’t AUTOMATICALLY INDICATE that BRUCE TANSKI sucks dudes better than a Hoover...
But, when I had to USE THE GOOGLE APPLICATION, to extract my EVIDENCE...
...it would upload from IMG_0528, IMG_0540, and so on...
...which means that somebody OBVIOUSLY HAD ONE IN THERE...
...because it was SELECTIVELY CHOOSING WHAT USELESS THINGS TO UPLOAD...
...and SKIPPING THE THINGS THAT MATTERED MOST...
So, when I double checked later on, I said: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me : WOW. 
     SORTA LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY’S DEFINITELY INTERCEPTING MY PICTURES ALRIGHT...~!

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

And THAT is what caused me to think: Well, obviously BRUCE TANSKI blows dudes.
That’s totally legal, actually.
But, what I was SEEING, involved a NUMBER OF COMPLICATED COMPONENTS...
...and it seemed to be that I had my finger right over a way to CONTROL...
...something INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED...
...by pissing somebody off.

Cause why would I select a BATCH of files, right? But only SOME of those files got uploaded...? 
Well, the reason is because I had determined with SHEER CERTAINTY, that someone was fucking with my device 
and the transmission, and they had ALL of my devices under control, not just my phone.

Why did I think my Aunt Terri had anything to do with it...? Nobody has ever fuckin’ asked me, but I’ll bet 
ya that MUJI HUSAN might wanna know why I fuckin’ messaged him on my 35th birthday... 
He works for the NEW YORK STATE POLICE - I think. 
HE is good friends with PAVEL ZAICHENKO JR. (← bisexual whose company I once ran, leaving untouched sales records)
I don’t think people really understand it...
I wasn’t just MORE SKILLED than PAVEL ZAICHENKO, or DWAYNE COONRADT...
I was also a LOT MORE INTELLIGENT. Still am. 
That’s why my sales records haven’t been remotely close to being MATCHED or EXCEEDED...
...even though *checks watch* it’s been like 3+ years since I worked there.

If I had a way of keeping track of records at NFRASTRUCTURE, I have no doubt at all, that whatever record it
was...? NFRASTRUCTURE would have had nobody in the last *checks watch* 11 years, that beat my record.
So like, imaging machines for ADIDAS-REEBOK of NORTH AMERICA, it’s been 11 years since I took a 4 HOUR PROCESS...
...and SHOVED IT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 20 MINUTES. Amazing.

Anyway, suppose Terri had no fuckin’ involvement at all. 
Well, there is the chance that it just LOOKED like she was. 
Ever since I had a conversation with her after going to Tati’s work back in like, idk... 2003 or 2004? 
This girl and I had plenty of interactions that were pretty good after all.
If anyone asks her “Hey, did you wanna fuck Michael Cook at one point...?”
If she’s being HONEST, then she will “Yeh. I did.”

But I was an idiot because, I wanted to get in her pants. 
Simply put, that’s … the most human excuse that I have. 
But I’m not gonna talk about that... 
I’d prefer to talk about how my aunt Terri spoke with me after I left the “book”: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Terri : *hands on hips* Michael, *scoffs* you need to fuckin’ go see a counselor or some shit... 
        Wtf bro?
Me    : Sorry, my father being murdered and everything, caused an issue where I don’t know what to say or do,
         ...after I made a fool of myself...
Terri : *tapping her foot like Sonic* Yeah...? 
        Stop making a fool of yourself then, idiot~!
Me    : YOU stop making a fool out of yourself...
        I’m gonna keep doin’ that cause, obviously I don’t know how to NOT do that...
Terri : Wow. 
        Unbelievable... 
        You know... 
        ...you should know better.
Me    : How would I know better, exactly...?
Terri : You know that she’s dating my son, Ryan...
Me    : Yeah. 
        I DO know that. 
        That’s when it got WEIRD.
Terri : What do you mean, it GOT weird...?
Me    : Pretty sure I’ve known her a lot longer than your son has.
Terri : Oh yeah...?
Me    : Yeah. 
        First time I saw this girl was in Ms. Quigleys homeroom, in Gowana. 
        Thought she was pretty hot then.
Terri : Obviously... 
        ...my son wouldn’t be dating her if she wasn’t...
Me    : Yeah well... 
        ...you don’t know a whole lot about me. 
        And you don’t know everything about her.
Terri : Oh, I know everything there is to know about her...
Me    : Pretty sure you don’t. 
        Have you seen her take a shit before...?
Terri : *scoffs* Michael... 
        ...c’mon, that’s gross.
Me    : I’m just sayin’... 
        ...you said you knew EVERYTHING about her...
        ...so, does she wipe with her LEFT hand, or her RIGHT hand...?
Terri : Yeah, well, look... 
        ...she DOES NOT WANT YOU TO BE IN TROUBLE... (← ulterior motive)
        ...but you need to fuckin’ do something else, cause...
        ...she thinks you’re gonna pop outta nowhere like fuckin’ Batman or some shit.
Me    : I’m not Batman, dude.
Terri : Obviously... 
        ...you’d have to get training from Rahs Al Guhl, to be a legitimate Batman, dude.
Me    : He doesn’t exist.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Anyway, yeh. That whole episode spanned from walking in Lowe’s one day, and seeing this girl working there. 
Then like some idiot, I didn’t make a real smooth move at all. 
Cause she was sending me mixed signals and I didn’t get it. 
So, I sent her some mixed signals right back...

Suffice to say, these (2) dudes that were trying to kill me on May 26th, 2020...?
They decided to drag up the past back on January 15th, 2019.
So, wasn’t my fault that someone wanted to act like a fuckin’ total moron.
Sorta moved on from all that shit, managing a computer shop, being on the news, outperforming everyone else...
...supporting my own family, and my kids, without the mother being involved...
...and it appeared as if a large circle of useless <unspecified> and dickfaces saw a prime opportunity...
...to fuck my entire life over, being a FATHER of (2) children.
    ___________________________________________________
So, | they’re gonna fuckin’ regret pushing me too far |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
These (2) dudes were parked basically where she used to park. 
And, considering that I had mentioned her name, and Ryan’s name in an audio recording...
I had a feeling that could cause some dickheads that I knew were surveilling me, to come out and play.

If I tell the police this entire story...? 
They will do what Michael Zurlo does, and go suck the bosses dick, and then write some false shit in a report.
Like Trooper Borden does.

They will think that there’s no fuckin’ way that it makes any sense. 
Except, earlier on May 25th, 2020, I walked all the way to Terri’s house, and on the walk there...
...I was ranting about Cortana, PRISM, police officers abusing the USA-PATRIOT Act to generate revenue...
...and on the way there, I saw the blue Nissan Sentra on Plank Road. 

Pretty sure it is the SAME ONE that I saw a couple nights prior, same one I would later see on July 5th, 2020.
July 5th, 2020 – saw some dude driving around in this car that looking like Anton pulling a 180° turn.
When I SEE people performing this 180° turn type activity, I IMMEDIATELY FLAG THAT AS SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY.

I also saw someone that may have been MATTHEW CALDWELL driving a SILVER SUV at GOODYEAR. ACROSS FROM KEYBANK.
No poncho. No hat. I was wrong in assuming he’d be wearing a PONCHO, and a HAT.

Also recognized some ADDITIONAL person, driving by in an SUV... Looked like the WOMAN from CPS that came to 
my house back on JANUARY 28th, 2020, and BOUGHT (2) beds for my children. Why did she do that...?
Well, it’s cause some fuckin’ cocksucker was busy accepting BRIBERY from MR. TANSKI. Probably MR. PICKETT TOO.

The thing about my rhetoric or stream of ideas...? 
Is that, I’m smarter than most people. (← That is definitely accurate.)
My streams of ideas aren’t unlike these (scripts/skits/conversations). 
Those conversations never happened anywhere CLOSE to verbatim at all. 

But, when you’re thinking about what could be possible or entertaining to read, you’re not going to think 
about how an actual conversation went down, unless it was RECORDED. Even still, sometimes people won’t even 
really understand that someone’s just shooting off ideas, one after another, and that day...? 

Well, I knew for certain at that point in time, that some people thrive off of:
____________________________
| death | pain | suffering |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
...of other people.
Which means that their MORALITY is CORRUPT. Which causes them to have LESS INTELLIGENCE and ACCURATE INTUITION.

Someone who would EVER DEVELOP the very first PROTECTIVE ARMOR that uses QUANTUM ENERGY, would be able to
prevent people from being INJURED, ASSAULTED, or otherwise KILLED.

Is something like that impossible...? 
No. It isn’t. There’s just too many morons on planet Earth who have questionable morality.

With enough thought...?
Someone intelligent with UNWAVERING CONVICTION will stand toe-to-toe against everyone that has 
MALICIOUS THOUGHTS/CORRUPT MORALS...

They will actually make everybody else that ever lived, look incompetent.
Mainly cause you have to be smarter AND tougher, to make history. Look at Elon Musk...
(SpaceX > NASA)
(Tesla  > General Motors/General Electric)

NASA had been around for A LOT LONGER and never ONCE did they EVER bother to build: 
- A rocket that can land itself
- and is therefore reusable
- and is therefore able to reduce the cost of sending things to space

Sure, might’ve been impossible BEFOREHAND...? 
But that’s because morons like George W. Bush run the world.

After this dude Elon Musk figured out how to: “balance a broomhandle in a hurricane”, now that shit is possible.
This dude increasingly claws away the CONTROL that so many morons have.
I’d like to say he is doing such a thing EFFORTLESSLY, but that wouldn’t be accurate.
He’s putting a lot of effort into doing this... sorta how like Arnold Shwarzenegger used to lift weights.
You just throw some more weight on the rack, and that is how Arnold became a champion body builder.
Imagine how many people existed BEFORE Arnold, who thought they would be the toughest dude who ever lived...
...and then Arnold comes along and made that dude look like quite a big pussy. Oh well dude, get in 2nd place.

Same concept applies to using quantum energy... 
Humans are not far from realizing fusion reactors that actually work. 
If General Electric had competent engineers, they could’ve made this thing 50-80 years ago.
But the only reason that they haven’t, yet...
...is because America thrives on laziness and incompetence.
After chasing it down for almost 80 years or more... 
...now we’re finally about to have it in our hands.

The movie “The Saint” talks about COLD FUSION... but I don’t think that was ever remotely possible.
Still a cool idea, and Val Kilmer was pretty good in that movie.
Skull-fucked all of his opponents, left and right, up and down...
You would be amazed at how easy it is, to fool people.

Quantum computers will soon use a totally different concept of computational power. 
Any reliably built quantum computer will break our current encryption standards VERY EASILY. 
Which means that sooner or later, someone will have a KEY to EVERY ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM ON EARTH...
AND, every password for all of them. 

Hm. Now, imagine if NOBODY EVER talked about that, right?
I’ll bet you fucking billions of dollars, that MICHAEL ZURLO doesn’t know about ANY OF THAT SHIT.
Neither does DWAYNE COONRADT, nor PAVEL ZAICHENKO, nor really, anybody in CLIFTON PARK NY.
That would include DR. OLIVER ROBINSON. (← I thought this dude might be humanity’s best shot at redeeming itself)

There are some scientists out there that are studying this, and have built countermeasures to prevent that 
from happening, but at the same time... people also think that there’s no such thing as Pegasus/Phantom. 
Well, there is such a thing. 
It’s a tool that I knew was on my device going WAY BACK to the land of January 15th, 2019.
I didn’t KNOW that it was there, I SPECULATED it was, because I couldn’t understand the: TRAJECTORY OF ATTACK.

How did I eventually know, or find out...? 
Well, because some cocky bastard was watching me write up a thing I was writing for Narcotics Anonymous.

I realized that God doesn’t restore people to sanity.
God, makes the decision to use, along with YOU.
So, God doesn’t restore someone to SANITY, YOU DO.

Someone was interacting with my screen, while I wrote some of these things.
I could tell quiver lip Trooper Borden, that someone was remotely interacting with my equipment and my 
devices, but, he’s gay. I would imagine that somebody like MARK ZUCKERBERG, does this to people. MARK, 
might be a real smart dude, and rather than to have an IN PERSON CONVERSATION WITH PEOPLE...
...he’ll invade people’s privacy, remotely interact with people on their devices, and isn’t the only one
that does such a thing.

HOWEVER, some people are allowed to do that. Some people aren’t.

Trooper Borden had a dick in his mouth, and can’t pull it out to help me at all... 
...so they all take it as if it’s a fucking joke. 
Someone, was stalking me for a long time, and there’s nobody you can go to, to get help. 
There’s supposed to be, but- anybody could be using this fuckin’ program, (Pegasus/Phantom)...
...if they have a million dollars or more, and the NSO group sells it to them.

YEAH, so the moronic thing here is that the ENGINEERS at the company APPLE... THEY ARE THE ONES THAT FIND
THESE VULNERABILITIES IN THEIR OWN PRODUCT, and then THEY SEND THEM to the NSO GROUP. COOL. 
NOBODY REALLY CAUGHT ONTO THAT, DID THEY...?

I THOUGHT TROOPER BORDEN WAS SUCH A FUCKIN AWESOME COP...?
Nah, he’s a LOUSY cop... and maybe he prefers to keep eatin’ those fuckin’ donuts.

I didn’t know these key details back when I recorded the video, but I knew damn well that I was: 
ACTIVELY BEING FOLLOWED. 

That’s why I just kept walking around recording videos and audio logs. 
One of the videos I recorded was on May 23rd, 2020 of (4) police vehicles running at the Clifton Park 
public safety building, and I state in the recording that someone in that building was compromised, 
and the rest of the state, ALSO compromised. When I say “compromised”, what I mean is that someone has
a dick either in their mouth, or their asshole, and that they would be embarrassed by the video.

For instance, the STATION CHIEF, who like, knows who owned the vehicle attached to the license plate: 
NYS/DVA-2450, on JUNE 20th, 2020. So when TROOPER BORDEN looks at my SON, and says “WHERE DID YOU GET THAT
LICENSE PLATE?!?” it’s cause TROOPER BORDEN KNOWS WHO THAT PERSON IS. (← You’re in trouble, fuckface)

Then, all throughout the night, I had somebody like, following me or some shit. 
Why...? 
I walked to Stratton Air National Guard the night before, that’s when somebody thought to BEGIN following me. 

Imagine if you would, that someone was ACTUALLY STUPID ENOUGH TO DO THAT...
...now stop imagining. Someone was stupid enough to do that.

That morning I posted a video that I recorded AFTER I walked to Stratton, of a DRONE. 
SOUNDS LIKE A BIRD, and was RESPONDING TO WORDS I SAID. 
That statement will sound insane to people are too lazy to check out the entire exhibit...

So, I recorded a video with my children for like an hour and a half, of me TALKING about the EVIDENCE 
I had collected. It’s called “EVIDENCE” when it fits the description...
evidence (NOUN: the available body of [facts/info] indicating whether a belief or proposition is [true/valid])

But hey. Someone didn’t know how to read a dictionary, (including Judge Paul Pelagalli) and that obviously 
pissed somebody off. The thing is, I was talking a lot of shit as I walked around the north side of town. 
I just kept walking, and I wound up walking all the way into Jonesville, passing Rybeks house on 146A, and 
then going up Main St. 

Then, on Main St. I could SEE the FBI vehicles passing me, cause they were interested in how I intended to 
catch Verizon in the act of being a bunch of homosexuals in tandem of James “Quiver lips” Comey, 
Hillary Rodham “Who gives a shit...?” Clinton, Andrew “Don’t touch me, grandpa” Cuomo, and 
George W. “Sausage Lips” Bush.

Hillary doesn’t care if I call her a homosexual, cause that’s how the double standard works.
You can try to call a girl a cocksucker, or a queer, it typically doesn’t bother them.

If a GIRL is caught eating another GIRL out, she can go right back to having sex with a dude, no problem.
If a GUY is caught sucking another GUY’s dick, he will never be able to have sex with any girl who sees that.

See how that logic works...?
Like my ex girlfriend would tell me “I hang out with this girl, and we dyke it out sometimes, so what...?”
But if I were to say “Yeah, Pavel and Dwayne...” not even gonna finish the sentence. 
Everyone knows what I was about to indicate.

Anyway, I know a fuckin’ FBI vehicle when I see one. 
SOME OF THEM are idiots. 
They merged the data between (2) completely different videos and made some CLUES in that process: 
A LOT MORE OBVIOUS.

$Book.AddSection(9,"Blatantly Obvious",@"
When I was in Bennington, I had an argument with Scott Salvadore, who is former military. 
He’s never been sent into war, but he knows people in the military, and those people kept fucking with 
me to no end. He kept saying “mutehammer”, which basically means “censorship button”. It’s also when he
gets down on his knees and sucks his brothers’ dick, vice versa.

Now, I was fucking with this kid, and somehow it looked pretty serious when I got his own Facebook
page over 2000 comments in a single day, and for some reason none of my pages or posts ever come 
anywhere near that.

Wanna know why...? 
It’s because some people get ACTIVELY CENSORED on Facebook, MORE THAN OTHERS.
Mark Zuckerberg has never once cared for being called a f-word.
Nope.
Cause he has had a lot of experience with having a dick in his mouth, in a very LITERAL way.

They talk about it in the movie “The Social Network”.
So, it has nothing to do with how COOL somebody is at all.

It has everything to do with 
1) how rich your family is
2) how highly engaged your content is

But, if you’re a gay dude who can THROTTLE other people’s (exposure/popularity), it’s because they 
know you’re a broke motherfucker, then nobody will see your content. That can actually cause someone
to remain in a locked in simulated JAIL CELL where they have to basically do some bitch work.

You could have 5,000 friends, and if you’re a broke bastard, your metrics get shot down to nearly nil.
But- hey, MARK ZUCKERBERG can lie to people about CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA, and somehow not get shot to death.
Or, the 2016 presidential election interference.
Or, the January 6th capital uprising. 
Somehow, people will believe HIM when he says “There’s NO WAY I’ll EVER be found with a dick in MY mouth...”
Yeah, there is.

John “7nm” Pickett and Scott Salvadore spoke about something, I am fairly certain. 
That’s when I started seeing such aggressive things on my networks and equipment.
If there was something goin’ on...?
I could count on the fact that 7nm was involved in the (node/process).

I truly think John, had some military buddies following me around, and that someone from Nfrastructure
was watching me do work at Computer Answers, and had a friend or buddy watching me on my phone...
If all of that is inaccurate, that’s fine. But there is no person on earth that can actually PROVE THAT.
Because if anything, there’s a fuckin’ clue that nobody ever collected from me that made me reliably
determine that it is MORE THAN JUST PLAUSIBLE.

So then, when SCSO Deputy Cooper came to my house on 06/19/20 and said “Nfrastructure is not involved” in
front of LAURA HUGHES... well...? I think you deserve to be DEMOTED and probably handcuffed and brought to 
your own jail. For: committing OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

Anyway, those are some SIDE POINTS, here’s how they’re relevant...
Because I said some of these things already earlier in the material.

I had a feeling that whole entire time, that somebody was watching some of the things I’d post on Facebook, 
or was violating my privacy for years when someone I once worked with at Nfrastructure (Jerimy Mahoney) 
told me that “I’d better watch out and stay outta Matt Caldwell’s way”, as it felt rather ominous. 

I wonder how JERIMY MAHONEY would feel, if he knew that my father and the OWNER OF NFRASTRUCTURE, had a 
PRIOR ASSOCIATION... ya know...? SHANNON from Applebee’s (a waitress my mother worked with) who married SCOTT, 
a guy I worked with at NFRASTRUCTURE... what if these people KNEW that my FATHER had some ASSOCIATION to: 
JESSE PICKETT back in 1989...? 
Hm. Then I might not come across as some useless dipshit that doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

I think what happened, was that Matt made damn certain that I would get BLACKLISTED, after my FIRST job,
after BEING CERTIFIED BY MICROSOFT. I am not certain of that...? But, it makes sense.

Anyway, after working at Computer Answers for like 3 years, we bought some equipment from Nfrastructure, 
like KVM rackmount stuff, monitors w/ keyboards, and wireless access points. 

I did plenty of experimentation with the network, and was thinking of a way to build a Wireless Controller,
since I did literally MORE work than anybody at KeyCorp, or Nfrastructure, when I worked at Computer Answers.
When I say “more work”, what I mean is that I, being (1) guy, had to perform the MULTIPLE ROLES of 
- Level 1-4 Engineer/Help Technician
- Level 1-4 Networking
- Level 1-4 Hardware repair
- et cetera.
...I hadn’t yet done any programming. 

Regardless, I was able to install the access point that some dude from Nfrastructure came to our shop, and 
sold us, back in like 2017. At or about the time that the (2) kids came in to sell CHRISTINA CZAIKOWSKI’s 
old smartphones. I don’t know if they were HERS, or not... but these 2x (guys/serial killers) that tried 
to kill me outside of the shop between (05/25/20 2343 → 05/26/20 0004)...? 

They were talking about her, saying: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Guy 1 : HEY BRO.
Guy 2 : YEAH...?
Guy 1 : DID YOU SEE TINA CZAIKOWSKI AT THAT PARTY LAST NIGHT...?
Guy 2 : YEAH BRO.
Guy 1 : *whistles* FUCKIN’ HOT, RIGHT...?
Guy 2 : YEAH BRO. 
        DEFINITELY.
Me    : *thinking* Yeah, she is.
        I recently saw her at Peddlers.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
        
She and I have had these mixed fuckin’ signals that Tati and I had, too. I met her one day working at CVS:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Me    : How can I help you...?
Her   : I’m here to pick up pictures...
Me    : Alright, last name...?
Her   : Czaikowski.
Me    : How do you spell it...?
Her   : C-Z-A-I-
Me    : Alright, I got it.
        *I find the picture envelope*
        So, I went to school with some dude named Chris that had the same last name.
Her   : Yeah, that’s my brother.
Me    : *confused* So you’re both named-
Her   : “Chris”, yeah.
        I get that all the time.
Me    : *shakes head* Alright.
        That’ll be (some total).

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Then she came back, again one day. Of course this is a long time ago, but she was incredibly nice, and I am
fairly certain I, too, was nice to her. Then, eventually she worked about 100 feet away from Tanski’s office.
And like, right next door to Computer Answers OLD location, where they sold `$5 footlongs for a while.

I was pretty close to offering HER a foot- Not gonna finish that sentence. Anyway, her brother got mad at me 
one day cause I dropped my paycheck, and I fuckin’ went in her job and blamed HER for finding it and doin’ 
somethin’ mad shady with it. But- that’s cause I fuckin lost it. Then, I found it.

Much later in time, she was working at Peddlers, and I tried to like, apologize. She was carrying some drinks
or something, and one of the drinks spilled over and I helped her clean it up. I can’t think of the best word
to describe the expression on her face, other than she APPEARED to be reluctantly thankful while smiling...? 
I dunno. Anyway, it really wasn’t that long afterward that I met these 2 dickheads that tried to kill me.

The access point I configured, was sold to us by an Nfrastructure employee at or about the same time. 
We ALSO had some dude from Spectrum come in, and randomly upgraded our cable modem... which I thought 
was strange. That dude installed the new cable modem, we had no internet, and then when he was just about 
done, he tried to take off. 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Tech : Alright, you’re all set buddy. Take care.
Me   : No, wait til we have internet FIRST, then you can take off.
Tech : Alright, if you insist.
Me   : I do.
       *waited minutes, no internet* 
       Hm. 
       Strange. 
       No internet, buddy. 
       We need that cause our phones and point of sale run off of it. 
       What’s the problem...?
Tech : Ohhhh, uh... 
       IDK man. 
       I’ll have to call back in...
Me   : Alright, you do that then.
       I’ll just sit here and watch you like a hawk because I sense something shady goin’ on.
Tech : Alright.
       That’s fine.
       *Spent another 15-20m talking to the Spectrum Business Network Operation Center*

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I found out, that they gave us the IP address for the fuckin’ East Greenbush store.
THAT was why the internet wasn’t working. 
Normally, someone who CALLS THEMSELVES AN EXPERT, or even just a PROFESSIONAL... 
...they’ll want to provide the CORRECT IP ADDRESS.
Not the incorrect one. 
So, if you’re like me, and you can run circles around MATTHEW CALDWELL any given day of the week, OR anybody
at Spectrum... they’re gonna get pissed if you tell them that they suck ass at their job.

Spectrum had a habit of doing this too. 
Do a sub-standard job...? 
Wind up being told “you obviously suck ass at the (1) job you have...”

Now, that could’ve been either because PAVEL had the accounts set up in a way that made no fucking sense.
OR, because people at Spectrum are morons,
OR, it could’ve been some asshole that sat at the networking operations center at SPECTRUM, right...?
And they knew damn well what they were doing... they were just looking to see “just how GOOD I really was...”
And, Mr. Pickett and his entire band of misfits...
...they failed to discourage me. So then they had to crank up the difficulty factor with the whole... 
“This kid will NEVER fuckin’ see this one comin’” strategy.

Either way you look at it, calling somebody a MORON... is not UNCALLED FOR AT ALL.

They’re not ALL morons. But they act a lot like the guy who tried to leave BEFORE we had the internet back up.
Overconfident. They did the work, it’s all set, take care. 
Well... That’s how careless the police are sometimes.
Nah, you did work that needs to be UNDONE, and your paycheck should be getting some HOURS deducted from it.
Not ADDED back in. (← That’s a fuckin’ problem)

They think they did things by the book. 
They’ll ASSUME that everything is good to go, when it isn’t.
And, the ones who do this, they will really aggravate me when I catch them in the act.

When I say that people make a lot of assumptions and try to fuckin’ move onto the next call before they 
even have their fuckin’ facts straight...? It’s accurate. 

I’m not going to say that ALL of the police or these 3 letter agencies all do this... they SURE AS HELL 
put more thought into it than SCSO or the NYSP. But, they’re not perfect either.

The truth is, all of these agencies and people probably make mistakes on every single interaction. 
Then, most people never find out that the interaction was recorded incorrectly. 
Because, like this dude from Spectrum, he was ready to take the fuck off...? 
Well, he didn’t make sure at all that we had internet. 

Had he left after performing sub-standard work like most of the police do...?
It’s like 99% of the job could’ve been done correctly, but that last, key, critical important component...
...caused the WHOLE ENTIRE JOB to need to be DONE AGAIN.                   (← That’s a problem if the police do that)

We would’ve needed to call them back, and then they would’ve probably given us the wrong information 
again, because they weren’t that guy. That guy WORKING for Spectrum, even needed a fair amount of time 
to correct the problem.

Now, apply that exact scenario to my entire situation, where... I know exactly what the fuck I’ve been 
dealing with, and that “something” is when some people think they’re fooling everybody. From nearly 
every angle, it looks like rich bastards can effectively call themselves “royalty”, and the police 
can effectively call themselves “always correct”, and so can the “justice system”, even when they’re 
definitely fucking wrong.

They don’t really care when they’re wrong, UNLESS they’re in Kim Potters shoes. 
She cared that she was wrong, but she made a fuckin’ mistake. 
The problem is, a lot of cops make mistakes and they keep their job because they keep lying about the 
mistakes they made. Apply that concept to SCSO, James Leonard, DJ Thompson, and Scott Schelling.

Now, how does all of this shit apply to my aunt Terri...? Not really a whole lot, other than some names 
that got dropped in the audio stream. However, on my way from 10 Innisbrook to the Clifton Park public 
safety building, I spoke about how when someone is DREAMING, they always remember that something that 
existed within that dream, stayed within that dream. 

I had a THEORY, that perhaps this same concept applies to REAL LIFE. Even though the internet was conceived 
AFTER I was born, maybe I JUST SO HAPPEN to EXIST at a point in time where it seems, very unlikely that I 
was born as a person, and not some mosquito, and that we’re playing with things like nuclear weapons, 
space travel, internet, etc. 

And I begin to think that Elon Musk is absolutely correct and that this is a simulation for sure. 
Not base reality. 
Simulations occurring within simulations, within simulations.
Each iteration of the simulation, something is learned by the entities OUTSIDE of that simulation.

But- of course, when somebody like a bunch of dickheads that are abusing mass surveillance programs 
that think they’re fuckin’ slick, hear that... they’re gonna keep some eyes on me after all. 
Until I get BACK to the Clifton Park public safety building, and whaddya know...? 
Fuckin’ more NYSP trooper vehicles running outside with nobody in them. Weird.

Yeah, I don’t particularly enjoy my demeanor in some of my content, but- the visual and something I said 
in that particular video PISSED SOMEBODY OFF, to the point where they looked at each other and said 

Them : Time to kill this fuckin’ guy, dude... 

Because, there I was, sounding like a total fuckin’ moron spouting bullshit for a while about a lot of 
things that were actually SPOT ON, right...? But then, I capture additional footage of a dick being found 
in somebody’s mouth, after all... (not some girl, either) 

And, managed to state IN THAT VIDEO, that I knew someone had software on my device and was following me around 
with it. I made mention of this like, back on (05/22/20 → 05/23/20) when I went to Stratton Air National Guard. 
I didn’t tell THEM that, because they really didn’t give a shit about the DRONE, or why it was IMPORTANT. 
Oh well. 
Once I made it to College Park Hall, I was able to record an additional couple of instances with the BIRD/DRONE.

Now it’s all connected. But- showing the police how it’s all connected causes some of them to think it’s 
too convoluted, however- that is sometimes a STRATEGY of theirs. They know damn well: 
1) what I was doing
2) why I came around making accusations 
3) who those (2) kids are that tried to kill me
4) my 911 calls were blocked 
5) what I was doing between January 28th, 2020 and May 25th, 2020... 
6) why I was talking about Capital Digitronics
7) who the Russian guy was that rented the 5th floor of 46 State Street, the building my uncle owned
...and that is the correlation I’m making between all of these things, and probably MR. TANSKI.
The ol’ jiggle-tits-mcTanski-face.

If I go to tell the police, how helpful will they be, realistically...?
Are they actually MORONS, or are they PRETENDING to be morons...?
Sometimes they’re just PRETENDING to be MORONS. 
That’s why it’s IMPORTANT to make AUDIO RECORDINGS of how they SOUND.
So then you can discern the difference.
If it’s a HOT FEMALE OFFICER OF THE LAW... 
it’s important to know if she’ll fuckin’ STAB YA AFTER THE SEX.   (← JAMES BOND PUT UP WITH THIS SHIT FOR YEARS, BRO)
Or if it’s someone who just TRUSTED SOMEONE THEY SHOULDN’T HAVE.

$Book.AddSection(9,"Sleeping with the Enemy",@"
(JAMES BOND/AKA 007) would still throw one in the enemy... if she was hot enough.

Then it’s a SHITTY PLAN.

If you DO, then what can they really do...? 
She’s gonna be A LOT LESS LIKELY to wanna hurt ya.
She’ll even go against her own family, cause she fuckin’ wants some more of that D alright...

In contrast, when it concerns a MALE OFFICER who just LIES TO EVERYBODY... then you gotta worry about how many

guys. Then, everybody’s basically fucked.

So if Bruce Tanski has his whole shit on lock...
And, John Hoffman has HIS back, and has HIS shit on lock...
And, Eric Catricala is literally in the State Assembly...
Then, they can all tell Michael Zurlo to suck a fuckin’ dick...
Then, the State Police might even do things because they trust Zurlo...
Then, the FBI might actually rely on both of what they say...
Then, the military might just have to look, standing back in wild fuckin’ amazement...

None of them will come to this conclusion UNLESS, there’s a stack of SUPPORTING EVIDENCE in hand.

Pictures         : Good, but not the best. These can help quite a lot of there’s nothin’ better.
Audio recordings : Great. Video recordings are even better. Because, then you might be able to STUDY the
                   MICROEXPRESSIONS and determine with SHEER CERTAINTY, that somebody’s fuckin’ LYING. 
Video recordings : Best. Because they are a combination of the above.
Timestamps       : Often overlooked, but- they’re fuckin’ ridiculously important because of how often
                   they’re overlooked, they can be OMITTED from ARREST RECORDS such as SCSO-2020-003173 
Documents        : Not exactly seen as the best type of EVIDENCE. However, they can ASSIST with CORROBORATION.

Not much anybody can really do when they have EVIDENCE of that POLICE OFFICER 
1) breaking the LAW 
2) COVERING UP A MURDER ATTEMPT  
3) IGNORING a PERFECT ALIBI 
4) MULTIPLE 911 CALLS
...other than just keep writing about it... like I have.
Because if you go around calling the police or trying to leave documents with people in the community,
that all of these fucks worked REAL HARD to try and contain evidence of a crime having happened...?

Basically 100% of the people you go to will think you’re insane. But- you’re not insane at all. They’re morons.

As for (06/18/20), (Criminal/State Assemblyman/Catricala) literally told the Sheriffs, that I was at the 
Catricala Funeral Home that day. Which, nah I wasn’t. Julie could attest to that. So could Dwayne. 

But, I don’t know if they actually would say anything. 
Regardless, that’s literally impossible.
THAT IS THE REASON, why Deputy Pirrone was in the plaza. 

This guy seems to think I’m fuckin’ stupid. 
He doesn’t realize I’m a lot smarter than his ass will ever be. 
Pretty consistent theme, me being able to rick-roll people with a lot more CAPITAL or REPUTATION... 
But somehow, I prove EVERY SINGLE TIME, when people UNDERESTIMATE ME, I have a sixth-sense after all.

I know when some POLICE OFFICER is NOT a cool dude. Tries to be slick, but winds up looking like a MORON... 
They (MAY/MAY NOT) notice I’ve caught em in the act...? 
But- they don’t fuckin’ care.
    
...Trooper Borden is one of the latter, might say he just called the Federal Counter-Terrorism Agency...
...cause he thought they were actual professionals that know everything...
...that agency may not be actual professionals at all though... 
...then AFTER this event happens, Trooper Carter will show up at my house...
...ignoring the pictures I had in my one hand, my smartphone in the other...
...not giving a flying fuck that a fellow officer lied to my face. 

Then Trooper Carter, proves that he doesn’t know what the fuck is goin’ on. 
Trooper Carter might repeat multiple times, that he doesn’t need to be intelligent to do his job.
I don’t think he’s a lost cause, I think I just need to find the right combination of words, so that 
he treats me with RESPECT the next time he sees me. Because, CLUES, fly right past this dudes head...

Nobody makes the CORRELATION to Pegasus/Phantom...
...that’s because when I tell people the police are stupid, it’s because they aren’t paying attention.

They’re NOT that stupid, in reality... 
...but when compared to me, they typically are. 
I’d say it’s probably 9 times out of 10, that I’m more intelligent than they are. 

But, it’s probably higher than that. 
Probably makes me sound like a condescending dickhead, but the cool thing is, it’s true. 
They don’t care how many times I say that, either. (← Oh, they fuckin’ care alright)

So, if you capture this stuff in an (AUDIO/VIDEO) recording, and you post a link to that online somewhere...?
...YOU might ALMOST get in REAL trouble somehow, which probably sounds (UNCONSTITUIONAL/fuckin’ stupid) actually...
...but THAT is how our country CURRENTLY works. 

Surveillance Capitalism. Everyone has been thrown into a probability matrix where the truest facts are ignored.
Because, who fuckin’ cares if you buy a new breakfast sandwich at Dunkin’ Donuts...? 
Well, the people who own Dunkin’ Donuts do.
Cause they know that people will buy whatever the fuck they cobble together.
As long as it SOUNDS good... that’s all that matters.
Doesn’t have to TASTE GOOD, doesn’t have to BE GOOD, doesn’t have to be WORTH THE MONEY...
What matters is if people will be stupid enough to buy it.
That’s why Bruce Tanski owns Halfmoon Sunoco and has a Dunkin’ Donuts there.
Perfect fuckin’ plan.

If I want to lie to people, they will believe me. 
I will fool 100% of the people I COULD lie to.
...meanwhile, when I tell some of them that I am a walking lie detector...?
...they get confused because "How could anybody be a walking lie detector...? That’s impossible."
    
It’s only considered impossible to people that don’t understand dramaturgy. 
A lot of people don’t understand that when Dwayne Coonradt would smile and be nice to the customers at 
Computer Answers, he would be nice up until they walked out the door. 
As soon as that person walked out the door, he’d say... "Stupid bitch. Lol."

That’s what dramaturgy is, everyone has a FRONT STAGE personality, as well as a BACK STAGE personality. 
Front stage says “Welcome to Computer Answers, how may I assist you today...?”
Back stage says “What a fuckin’ stupid cunt. LOL.”

Anyone can have these nice friendly conversations with people, but when nobody is around...?
...they might be talking some serious shit. 
Or, people act differently in public than they do in private. Same thing.

Me...? I’m not a coward like he is, if I think that about somebody, I will say it to their fuckin’ face. 
The principle there is, “I am a little too blunt”.
But then that means if I tell you something...? 
You can actually trust what I’m saying without putting any thought into it.

Some people will think that because I had some nerve to call them a sniveling spineless little cocksucker,
THAT must mean I’m DELUSIONAL because I just OPENLY INSULTED somebody “important”...~! 

Well, that’s because they’re not really that smart. 
Someone that thinks they’re intelligent, who does something that isn’t intelligent at all...? 
That’s IMMEDIATE grounds for me to insult somebody. 

Doesn’t mean I’m DELUSIONAL...? 
It means I’ll insult somebody on my first interaction with them.
ESPECIALLY when I PARAPHRASE that as “I was able to detect a dildo in that person’s asshole, at that time.” 

Because, that requires 1) Intelligence, 2) testosterone and 3) confidence. 

Three things that dude has always lacked.
Cause he lies to people constantly, and none of the police ever stop to catch him in the act. 
Rather than asking him stuff.	

If I say RICHARD TODD LOEBER commits MEDICAL FRAUD, these fucks will ASK him:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Police: Hey, RICHARD TODD LOEBER, you don’t like, commit MEDICAL FRAUD... do you?
Loeber: *scoffs* No, lol! 
Police: Alright... christ. 
        Can’t believe I actually asked you...
Loeber: Why did you...?
Police: Some guy has your license plate number and vehicle identification number, and... 
        ...apparently he sounds like he’s out of his mind...
Loeber: Probably is. 
        Probably needs to get an evaluation. 
        Send him my way.
Police: Alright, thanks Dr. Loeber.
        Take care.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

That’s why the police NEVER catch people who DO commit MEDICAL FRAUD or LIE TO PEOPLE. 
The ones that want to uphold the law, they will go and ask that dude... 
...rather than to INVESTIGATE or CATCH that motherfucker in the act.                              (← STING OPERATION)

Me   : Alright, someone steals customers hard drives out of their machines.
       Then, he clones those hard drives with a software utility called Macrium Reflect.
Cops : OK. 
       Got it. 
       What next...?
Me   : So, he’ll grab BAD hard drives that COMPUTER ANSWERS owns... 
       ...and try to clone the customers’ hard drive to it.
Cops : OK. 
       Got it. 
       What next...?
Me   : So... before a customer brings the laptop or computer in, the hard drive has these (4) things...
    (1) MANUFACTURER
    (2) MAKE
    (3) MODEL
    (4) SERIAL NUMBER
Cops : Alright got it. 
       What am I supposed to do with that information?
Me   : Well, open the device and then grab the information on the hard drive label. 
       Maybe even take a picture.
Cops : Ok. 
       Then what...?
Me   : Bring the device to Computer Answers. 
       When Dwayne is working.
Cops : Ok. 
       Then what...?
Me   : Just wait. 
       He’ll take about a full week to get back to you probably.
Cops : ...thought it was supposed to be (3) days...?
Me   : It’ll take about a full week for this guy to give a shit about your computer. 
       Then he’ll leave a message.
Cops : Ok, got it. 
       Then what...?
Me   : Listen to the voicemail.
Cops : OOH, that’s good. 
       Never thought of that.
Me   : Yeah, so, then-
Cops : ...then what?
Me   : *pause* Call him back.
Cops : Oh, wow. 
       This sounds REALLY exciting...~!
Me   : *pause* So, he may answer the phone...
Cops : Awesome, *gives a thumbs up*. 
       He probably WILL answer the phone, won’t he...?
Me   : Yeah so, if he does...? 
       Wait for him to say something like “hard drive, operating system, warranty, SSD”
       Ask him for the price for each of those services.
Cops : Alright, then what...?
Me   : Tell him “Ah man, what am I gonna do... Ah man. I’m gonna pick the device up, actually.”
Cops : Ok, then what...?
Me   : ...go pick the device up.
Cops : Alright, do I just go THERE to pick it up, or...?
Me   : Uh, yeah. 
       Same place that you dropped it off at. 
       That’s where you’ll have to go...
Cops : Ah. 
       That makes sense. 
       Jeez. 
       Silly me. 
       What do I do after I pick it up?
Me   : You’ll have to sign for it. 
       Then you may as well open it right there and then, and look at the hard drive.
Cops : Alright, what then...?
Me   : Well, if you took a picture, look at the god damn picture. 
       Then, look at the hard drive...
       ...and see if they’re the same.
Cops : If they’re the same...?
Me   : Then, he didn’t do the swapping of the customer hard drive. 
       He doesn’t ALWAYS do this.
Cops : And, if they’re different...?
Me   : Then you have a crime that you can see with your own eyes. 
       One that just fuckin’ happened, at COMPUTER ANSWERS.
       By a guy that has been dating MELANIE GOLDSTEIN for like DECADES.
       GOLDSTEIN can PRINT (REAL/FAKE) COP CARS.
Cops : Oh, ok.
       Then what...?
Me   : You... have to be the dumbest cop I’ve … ever met man. 
       Seriously...?
       You’re asking ME what YOU should DO...
       ...when you’ve detected a guy swapping parts around to AGGREGATE his businesses profit. 
Cops : Hey buddy~! 
Me   : *hands up* Look, just being honest with ya. 
       You sound like a fuckin’ dog following me around for permission to have an idea...
       Wants to play fetch with me, and keeps trying to give me a stick...
Cops : Look pal. 
       This is, really complicated stuff you’re tellin’ me. 
       Normally I just eat donuts and sit at u-turns.
       Not real complicated stuff.
Me   : Hey, do you know how to roll somebody’s fingers, to take fingerprints...?
Cops : Well, obviously.
Me   : That’s A LOT more complicated...
       ...than this.
       Even fuckin’ DJ Thompson knows how to do that.
Cops : It is...?
Me   : Yeah. 
       So if anything...? 
       Idk man... 
       If the FATE of HUMANITY, as well as the REST of the WORLD rested in YOUR HANDS...? 
       I fuckin’ would NOT feel very confident that humanity would survive...
Cops : C’mon dude. 
       Don’t be so negative... 
       I can probably do this.
Me   : Well, I fuckin’ hope so dude...
       *shakes head* Cause, I’m fuckin’ worried.

The cops aren’t THAT stupid, at all.
I’m gonna say with SHEER CERTAINTY, that 0% of them, are that fuckin’ moronic.
I don’t know though.
Covering up a murder attempt and blocking my 911 calls sounds like something a very HIGHLY INTELLIGENT PERSON
would THINK to do, if they ASSUMED they would NEVER get CAUGHT.
But, that perfectly characterizes someone being that moronic after all.

...to where I’m going to feel like I have a loyal dog, asking me to throw the stick.
I’ll give in, and throw the god damn stick, and then 5 seconds later, dog’s got the stick and is NUDGING 
me with it... 

Not only is that CHARACTERIZATION (degrading/offensive)... 
But it is also highly manipulative.
However, sometimes it is true.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Intent (3)",@"
The problem is, they will trust people that aren’t very FORTHRIGHT about LYING to their faces.
Like, Trooper Carter, literally has that dudes’ mentality up above, because he will trust SCOTT SCHELLING.
Not even exaggerating in the least. He is... not a real smart dude I’ll tell ya that much.
He probably is, but he’s judging people by their PERSONALITY.
Not a smart idea if you’re a police officer.
Trooper Borden, ALMOST as bad.

Tell the police the truth, sometimes they really are morons, but they don’t care.
If you’re like me, you’re not making sense to them because you’re a lot smarter than they are.

They will take offense to being told that.
So, DON’T TELL THEM.
That means if you ARE more observant than they are...?
Keep it to yourself.

If they’re not smart enough to get it...? 
Then, you can’t piss em off by giving them ANY indication that maybe they’re not that bright. 

Cause then you’re damned if you DO, and damned if you DON’T. 
You’re screwed either way.
Might as well give up and just, fuck off.
You lost.

<The end>

Nah. It’s not the end of the story.
Some people will have no idea that using the whole “Well, that’s basically all I can do, isn’t it...?”
...is REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY.

Some people will be like “Yeah, that DOES mean it’s over. The end. Finito. Bye bye. Take care.”
...and then that IDIOT goes right ahead and starts BRAGGING about it.

You can actually TRAP THEM, PRETENDING to be a DUMBASS. 
They may very well COMMIT a CRIME just like on AUDIT THE AUDIT. 

Not each of those videos shows an officer of the law committing a CRIME per se, but-
Sometimes there will be an officer that has a PERFECTLY INTACT SET OF MORALS, AND ETHICS, that SEES their
teammates committing IMMORAL/UNETHICAL shit, and then they have to say shit like ‘EVERYBODY STAND DOWN’...

[False 911 Call Leads to HUGE Lawsuit]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6id-R6oPDH4 
I’ll paraphrase the above video link.
Someone calls 911, the police show up, and start responding to the 911 call details BEFORE they even know
what the fuck is actually goin’ on. THEN, one of the officers is INTERVIEWING with the PERSON who ACTUALLY 
was WORRIED, about someone in the hotel... and then after TALKING to that PERSON...?

That police officer IMMEDIATELY says over the radio “EVERYBODY STAND DOWN...” (← What SCSO doesn’t fuckin’ do)

OR...
[Cop Goes Crazy But Ends Up Getting Promoted]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6UBecuYBi0 
They literally do something that is fucking straight-up illegal and Nazi Germany like... 
...where they’ll just feel uncomfortable that you have a fuckin’ registered gun in the TRUNK, and you’re at 
the wheel, and a police officer doesn’t like that you know your rights.

Yeah. 
Some female officer does this. Whips out her gun, and points it at some dude who’s got both of his fucking
hands on the god damn steering wheel. Weapon is in the trunk. So, in her eyes, she understandably thought 
that this dude could be like David fuckin’ Copperfield at any given moment, and just... I don’t know man. 
Bitch was a moron, but somehow she got a promotion for that whole ordeal... which just goes to show...?  

The cops... sometimes they’re actually fuckin’ morons.

These fucks that tried to kill me, have had me on a SPECIAL LIST OF PEOPLE, because they SUSPECT that I’m
just gonna pop outta fuckin’ nowhere, like I’m literally Batman.

      I’m fuckin’ Batman, bro.

      I dunno dude.
Me  : Heh.
      Knew you’d say that...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

They don’t actually LIKE the idea, of being caught committing crimes while on duty. 
SO, at THAT point... they will PRETEND I’m just psychotic or just babbling on... 
That’s right, PRETEND...
Cause they know that I have the same philosophy of Batman.
I’m not gonna fuckin’ pop outta nowhere...
But they have to keep their eyes peeled for some NEFARIOUS REASON.

It’s cause I know my rights. 
I also know of a list of people that are doing some incredibly questionable shit.

Nearly exactly like when someone tells a mentally challenge person a JOKE...
...the (police officer/mentally challenged) person is confused and doesn’t laugh at the punchline.
So if I’m in that category of people where my intelligence IS high enough to be within GENIUS category...
...that’s when a police officer says to themselves that shit MUST be crazy.

Cause, they don’t give a shit if they get the joke or not... 
...just like how Eric Schnackenberg doesn’t give a shit if I keep depositing his name in documents where
I insult his intelligence over and over... Once they are told a SINGLE joke they don’t understand the 
“punchline” to...? 
They will skip right to accusing someone of having psychological issues.

That’s actually against the law. (← It is.)
If they’re caught doing that, on (AUDIO/VIDEO)...?
They might as well start packing up and getting ready to move into a prison cell for a while.

Wanna know why...? Because, every time they get a call, their system pulls up a profile. 
If that profile has INACCURATE INFORMATION, they can ACCIDENTALLY KILL SOMEONE. 
OR, (MISLABEL/IGNORE) someone. 
I know a lot of people will FEEL like I’m exaggerating when I say, that’s Nazi Germany shit. 
Generally people do make large exaggerations, but sometimes it is a (LITERAL/VERBATIM) comparison.

Once the police start breaking the law, they stop being any percentage of helpful in any fucking way.
Because their idea of "helping you" is tossing you a heavy fuckin’ brick when you’re treading water at sea,
not a life preserver. 
Probably sounds moronic, right...? 
But, sometimes that’s what they consider "helping you”. 
Seriously.
Doesn’t sound very HELPFUL AT ALL, does it...?
Probably sounds quite humorous. Oh, ha ha, threw me a brick, now I’m sinking to the bottom of the ocean.
Good one, ya fuck...~!
    
Some of them may say:

Yeah, nah. Fuck you for possibly thinking that at all.
Anthony Agresta wasn’t an asshole. He did write some false statements in SCSO-2020-002998.
That report is NOT totally accurate, but- I’m not making a stink about those comments because the OTHER PARTY 
was HIGHLY INTOXICATED, and I WASN’T ARRESTED or anything like that. 

However, sometimes I have to repeat things because I am DEFINITELY making a stink about many of the other 
records, because even the above matter SCSO-2020-002998 has some INACCURATE STATEMENTS in it. Am I gonna PRESS 
CHARGES against the officer or my stepfather...? No.

Still, other records I sorta fuckin’ DO wanna do that.
Each time I repeat myself I get slightly more frustrated/aggravated. 
Because, I’m a pretty good judge of character, or even knowing when someone didn’t actually hear what I said.

When it comes to psychology, I am USUALLY better at it than the police are.
However, I know that the FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS I have occasionally run into, they’re slick bastards alright.

I gave Captain Jeff Brown a run for his money and got the record I needed. 
I outsmart doctors. 
I can tell when a police officer has no intention whatsoever, of being helpful at all. 
Like, from the first fucking sentence out of their mouth.

Then I’ll get someone that says "How do you even know that though...?"
I actually lose my cool with people because of how oblivious they are.
I could say something, and the next sentence, they will ask me a question, that I JUST fuckin’ answered...
And when I say "I just said why..."...? 

Well, apparently the WAY that I said:

Now I’m REAL fucked, dude.
Cause I was a rude, insensitive, mean, jerk-faced fuckin’ trollmeister, times 50...
...to somebody who wasn’t paying attention.
Now, somebody is crossing their arms, pouting, has their back turned toward me, and I’m not gettin’ invited to 
ANYBODY’s birthday party, EVER AGAIN. Nope. Not me.

Could’ve been stated in the most calm way, no problems, not being an asshole, and then someone will insult my 
intelligence right there and then... So, when they do this, I have to casually insult that person in return.
    
I’m not gonna act like a snippy dickhead to someone that asks me stuff, and genuinely doesn’t know. 
I have children, I didn’t snap at my son or daughter when they asked questions. 
Not unless they knew better, and they were misbehaving anyway. 
Some of these guys don’t even know, I have kids so when I say that, they’ll be surprised.

        Do you do this *ALMOST* thing quite often...?
Borden: Yeh. 
        Girls though...?
        Maybe I’ll fuck one someday... 
        Waitin’ till I get married to the right one.
Me:     Cool, that sounds pretty gay actually.
Borden: ...it does?
Me:     Yeah man, totally.
        Almost fucking some girls, but never really doing that, and waiting for the right one...

Me:     Oh, wow.
        Nobody does that unless they’re Mormons or some shit. 
        I don’t even think Mormons do that.

Me:     I have a smartphone AND evidence... 
        ...I’d like a TRANSPORT to the NEAREST FBI field office, or military base.
Borden: Look dude, I can’t do that.
Me:     You literally just told me you would do that though...
Borden: I KNOW I said that I would... but I was lying to you.

A lot of people say this, where "if such and such, somebody would’ve done such and such by now."
That’s because people don’t realize that I meet a single condition where my situation happens to be SO RARE, 
...that they don’t know how to make an exception where I’m fuckin’ spot on, bub. You’re not.
    
People will casually insult me, or my intelligence. Right...? And then when I start getting an attitude 
with them, they may say that my attitude was uncalled for. Nah, it definitely was called for, after all. 
Wanna know why...? 
Cause someone insulted me, or my intelligence, literally the last sentence out of your fuckin’ mouth buddy. 
They’re gonna try "But I’m such and such I don’t take orders from you" 

They’re gonna keep doing that, by arguing with me.
The police are experts at doing this. 
They prove this, over, and over, and over, and over... 
The next time...? They do it again. The following time...? Again, same playbook.
They are SO FUCKING PREDICTABLE, and so is everybody else.
They ASSUME that since I know so much about how the police operate, that I’m a troublemaker. 
They never think "what if the police are the troublemakers...?"

Well, that’s because I AM that intelligent, that I can tell when unconstitutional laws are written that 
protect a judge from getting in trouble for committing a crime in his own courtroom. 
If you tell the police "judge, crime, courtroom", the police really are too oblivious to understand that. 

They think a judge CAN’T commit a crime in his own courtroom (yeah they can). 
While I’m not gonna say that Paul Pelagalli committed a crime in his own courtroom...
I am gonna say that he never mailed me the order to turn myself into the jail in (April-May 2021). 
Then, Dennis Bruce tells me “You’re supposed to turn yourself in...” 
Ohhhh, I was, dipshit...? Huh. Didn’t get anything in the fuckin’ MAIL that said so...
Interesting.

Pretty difficult to know I’m supposed to do that if the judge is lying about mailing me documents, 
and then my public defender is also lying.

So, I have multiple audio recordings of people at Family Court, not knowing they were emailing me appearances 
off by 5 hours, and then, ordering me to go to a clinic to see (2) doctors that don’t even work at the place 
they ordered me to go to. 

Then, when I tell the receptionist AND my public defender, that I want to have appearances in PERSON...?  
They’ll both ignore that. The receptionist DID say, I have to put it in writing. She didn’t ignore that. 
But I told the “lawyer”, the “lawyer” didn’t care. 

They appointed a “lawyer” that wasn’t even doing the “bare minimum”. 
She was pretty fuckin’ swift right after the court was over...
“Here’s the order that the judge signed that you’ll have to go get completed. Let me know when you do.”
Ok, so I went and attempted to follow this order, even though I was ALREADY A PATIENT AT THAT CLINIC. 
Then, the clinic tells me:

Clinic : Uh, NEITHER of those DOCTORS even WORK HERE, dude. 
         What the actual fuck...? 
         An actual judge ordered this...?
Me     : Yeah, a judge in real life. 
Clinic : This “judge” you’re talkin’ about...
         Is not a PRETEND judge, right...?
Me     : Right.
         An ACTUAL judge named Paul Pelagalli, from Saratoga County Family Court.
         REAL court.
         REAL order. 
         REAL lawyer, sent a REAL email, that told me I need to do something IMPOSSIBLE.
Clinic : Well, what the fuck dude, they don’t even work here...
         It’s as if the judge was just EXTREMELY CARELESS when he wrote it.
Me     : Nah, judges don’t make mistakes like that, EVER.
Clinic : I mean, a REAL judge wouldn’t make a careless mistake like that... 
         ...and then sentence you to 20 days in jail.
Me     : I know.
         I think that the judge who ordered it...
         ...maybe he’s just a really good ACTOR.
         Maybe they’re all ACTING...
Clinic : Oh well, dude.
         Nothin’ you can really do about it...
Me     : Nah, I know that.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

But, made just as much sense as a pretend judge, pretend order, and pretend lawyer, not realizing that a 
pretend <unspecified> from CPS decided to lie when she wrote a letter of indication. 

Pretend lady from CPS writing some fictitious bullshit based on the conversation she lied about having with people 
at Saratoga Hospital, because hey... maybe this lady somehow talked to some doctor somewhere and that Eric 
Schakenberg was lying to me, and Richard Todd Loeber was lying to me, and also Oliver Robinson was lying to me.

THEN, Michael Whiteacre lied to me, then John Hildreth ALSO lied to me. 
What I can see pretty FUCKING CLEARLY, is that somebody is fuckin’ lying to everybody and I just... 
I get pretty pissed off, thinking about how Sarah Schellinger would get this snobby fuckin’ attitude with me
because I told her... AND Kristen Johnson, AND Laura Hughes... that (2) fuckin’ dudes, they tried to kill me 
the night that Scott Schelling never wrote any notes in a report where I had evidence that was NEVER FUCKING
COLLECTED BY ANYBODY.

But hey. I gotta go to a place to see these (2) fuckin’ doctors to do what I was told.
bBcause the people that told me what to do are fuckin’ CARELESS MORONS. 
It’s illegal to record audio recordings of people sounding like fuckin’ careless morons. 
Probably also illegal to record Dwayne Coonradt stealing customers hard drives to keep Computer Answers intact.

It probably does all sound fuckin’ stupid when I say it out loud, right? 
That my rights are being violated by people that are CARELESS and LYING TO PEOPLE. 

But hey. 
Whatever dude. 
I went and scoped out where both of those doctors offices were, and sent them a copy of the order. 
Right...? 

But they BOTH said “An actual judge wrote this...?”
Yeah. Emailed it to both of them.
They both said the EQUIVALENT of “This is a fucking joke... right...?”
They both told me that the order needed to be rewritten. 
Then, I told Sarah Schellinger. 4 months later, she STILL hadn’t gotten a “CHANCE” to get back to me.

            His ATTITUDE tells me that WE NEED THAT EVALUATION...
Me        : Well, you ordered me to go to a place to see (2) doctors...
            ...that don’t even work at the place you ordered me to go to.
Pelagalli : *sigh* Yes, I know...
Me        : Well, that’s an oversight on YOUR part.
Pelagalli : *in shock* Alright, take him off.
            TAKE HIM OFF RIGHT NOW.

Didn’t hear back from her. Wanna know why...? This (CUNT/PUBLIC DEFENDER) was ignoring everything I sent her. 
That’s why I decided to make an audio recording of the appearance on April 6th, 2021. 
Then, as I expected... ?
I was kicked out of the fuckin’ virtual appearance for providing a “you made a mistake, bro” comment. 

How cool is that...? The court can LITERALLY send me emails with the WRONG FUCKING TIME FOR THE APPEARANCE,
off by a total of (5) fucking hours. Right...? THEN I can wind up getting myself thrown in jail because 
Neil “Chowder Lips” Weiner wants to make up fuckin’ several excuses not to locate the mother of my children.
THEN, Sarah can like, ASSIST with PROVISIONING AN EXCUSE... RIGHT...? 
Not 1 time does the judge APOLOGIZE TO ME, for having to deal with people that CALL THEMSELVES PROFESSIONALS,
but are very fucking far from it.
Just go right ahead, take my fuckin’ kids away, might as well throw me into an electric chair BEFORE I wind up 
killing somebody. But- you really have to wonder, right...? If I haven’t killed anybody YET...? That says a lot.

Give em to some cunt that lied a thousand times on her petition. 
Then, prevent me from being in my own fucking trial. Don’t call that COMMUNISM, call it JUSTICE.

So, here’s the thing. 
I’m SURPRISED that ALL of these people, haven’t crashed into a slab of concrete in the middle of the highway.    
Because... I’m certain they are CONSISTENTLY this careless. 
How does this shit happen in like, a fuckin’ domino effect...? 

Well, I’ll tell ya. 
Everybody else in the world, they will never even know this shit is just what people do. 
Everybody makes mistakes. 
But- I think that MOST people aren’t INTELLIGENT enough... 
...to KNOW when SOMEONE is right in the middle of making ASSUMPTIONS, or CARELESS MISTAKES... 
Because, even if somebody IS in the middle of making assumptions or careless mistakes...? 
If you even THINK about TELLING some people that they’re doing that...?!?

You’re gonna get in a lot of fuckin’ trouble buddy.
You’ll get yourself sent to jail for 20 fuckin’ days.
Does that sound moronic...? Too bad. 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Pelagalli : I’m Judge Pelagalli, fuckface. 
            20 days. 
            Not even gonna MAIL you the order to turn yourself into the jail. 
            Fuck you.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

It happened to me, and I stand to earn *calculates `$285 * 20 for each day I was at the jail...
But, that’s basically pennies on the dollar for the amount of money I intend to sue the County of Saratoga.
That’s right. The actual GOVERNMENT... of Saratoga County.
`$300M.
That’s basically ME, allowing myself to commit BRIBERY like TED CRUZ does... 
...without Exxon Mobil’s mouth watering at the notion of drilling ME between the ass cheeks.
I can tell ya, that ain’t fuckin’ happenin’ cap’n.

So, most people just do what they’re told. They don’t even fuckin’ consider that maybe the police that I put up 
with, they act a lot like the Brits did in 1776, and the Brits needed their asses kicked because they kept forcing 
the colonists to pay for the shitty tea.

So then people will be like "OoOoOhhHh, you’re threatening to assault police officers, that’s illegal~!"
Well, sometimes people need to be provided with an attitude adjustment.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Attitude Adjustment",@"

They’re not gonna do it on their own.
They have made the process of giving people attitude adjustments, "illegal".
So now, they can basically act exactly like the Brits did in 1776.

Eric Schnackenberg didn’t realize that I almost kicked the shit out of him in his own office the last time 
I saw him for acting this way. ALMOST. It’s better that I only ASSAULT people for having an attitude with me,
than to be an actual psychopath that will go to Tops in Buffalo, and shoot multiple innocent people. 

But even still, I’d rather just write these documents and embarrass some people that aren’t capable of 
providing me with "respect".
    
Whether the police have decided to actively break the law, OR, someone really IS insane or has psychological 
issues, they will treat BOTH of those situations in an *identical way.* They will accuse you, of being a 
perpetrator, and they have to accuse someone of doing something illegal, and then arrest, OR, detain that 
person. Once they think someone is insane...? It doesn’t even matter if they are, or aren’t.

You can say whatever the hell you want to them, they aren’t intelligent enough to understand any of it... 
they will write down whatever they feel like. ESPECIALLY if it is FALSE.

Even if there’s an AUDIO RECORDING, that would DIRECTLY CONTRADICT what those police officers falsified in 
their report. They really don’t care. Does anybody do anything about it...? Well, some lunatics will take 
Duffle bags worth of assault rifles, go to Mandalay Bay, and just mow down every person he can. 

The reason why they do shit like that, is because...
Stephen Paddock may have been part of the problem, but I’m also certain that SOCIETY was ALSO the problem, 
and he snapped. Sorta the theme I was touching on when my Facebook posts were selected by someone that 
didn’t really care for the theme of all my posts. Nah. I was writing. Their ass couldn’t write if their 
life depended on it. They could sure as hell read though... What happens sometimes is that someone just 
isn’t nearly as intelligent, but they’ll rest on their laurels.

Do I think Heather-Corey Mongue was the one doin’ that...? Partially.
What about Lisa Mentes...? Partially.
What about Sarah Schellinger...? Partially.
What about someone who’s also a public defender, who I went to kindergarten with, who doesn’t say a 
fuckin’ word...?
Seems pretty fuckin’ obvious to me that she’s involved too.

Anyway, even though I never whipped out a gun and started mowing people down with it... 
...and even though 3 black guys murdered my father when I was in Skano Elementary in the same fuckin’ class 
as another public defender that current works for Saratoga County... well...? 
Fuck. 
Not (1) time did I, Michael C. fuckin’ Cook, think that I should go to Tops, in Buffalo, and fuckin’ target 
those innocent black people. Cause, like I said earlier in this document... 

If anyone has a GOOD REASON to do something like this sick fuckin’ kid did...?
I’m pretty sure I fit that profile. 
But, the strange thing is, they are confused by the fact that I haven’t yet done that. 
It’s been what *checks watch* 25 years now...? Weird. 
Almost as if I write documents to skull-fuck people because they’re morons.

Nah what’s happening is that people are acting a lot like a communist state where I have to do something, 
right...? But, when I am a productive member of society, someone can try and kill me with advanced 
cyberattacks and a tool called Pegasus...?

Then, all of those people I just listed, they’re gonna get offended that I’m just a lot more observant 
and intelligent than most people, that would include the police, them, the judge, the doctors... 
...so on and so forth.

I’m not special. 
I’m probably (1) guy out of tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, if not more... 
...that have been TARGETED in this EXACT FASHION and METHOD, but- 
I know that I have to be pretty special to have DETECTED ALL OF IT, and SURVIVED THIS LONG AFTERWARD.

Why are they confused though? Is it because they’re fuckin’ morons? Yeh. It is cause they’re morons.
Same thing with the kid in Buffalo.
Same thing with Columbine.
Same thing in San Bernadino... 

There’s so many places where someone has fuckin’ snapped... 
It’s MORONIC to blame ONLY THE INDIVIDUAL.
The problem really is... SO MANY PEOPLE ARE CARELESS MORONS.
It’s not JUST that, but also... some people do this shit intentionally, and they’re never caught either.

So are people like Eric Schnackenberg, Susan McDermott, Richard Todd Loeber, Trooper Borden, Trooper Carter, 
And SCSO Deputy Cooper...
People don’t like being told that they’re morons.
They also don’t like being SHOWN when they are careless morons, either.
They don’t like being outsmarted by someone who’s a lot less important or has a lot less money...
They don’t like when someone does that shit anyway...
They will actually ask for help from their buddies, from other people in the community, 
...to wrap a made up story around someone that continues to embarrass a lot of people... right?

That’s why these random shooting sprees take place actually, cause they really would prefer that someone 
snap and lose their fucking mind. They don’t care. Their pride or reputation is a LOT more important than 
YOUR life, or a lot of other people’s lives. They’ll blame YOU instead of themselves.

And that’s why Uvalde, Texas is just the NEWEST addition to the list of tragedies. 
I expect thousands more to happen, just like I expect thousands of additional people to die from 
opiate overdoses. “People don’t give a shit.” -Eric Schnackenberg

They expect to be respected, even when they’ve done NOTHING to deserve any respect, OR,
...if they just casually think nothing of disrespecting YOU.

Casually disrespecting someone that hasn’t done anything to deserve disrespect...? 
That is a perfect reason to give someone an attitude adjustment.
    
Because, I could compliment them, sarcastically... and they always think I’m being serious.
If they don’t understand why I just complimented them, they’ll just be confused... 
So, they won’t know if they need to do anything about it.
If they’re JUST confused, then how could they possible CARE if they’ve been offended, since they don’t 
KNOW they were offended.
    
And that’s how it works. I’m not saying that every police officer deserves to be manipulated like this, 
because I don’t use these techniques unless I detect a dildo hiding in *somebody’s* asshole... 
...and just so we’re clear so that nobody is confused, that’s a metaphor.

Unless, it isn’t a metaphor at all.
It’s not hard for me to detect it, because I’m a walking lie detector.
Which is why people avoid talking to me, sometimes.

So if people can casually disrespect others, but they expect to BE respected...
...and they have no fear of being held accountable for making careless mistakes...
...and CAN’T be held accountable LEGALLY for making mistakes...
...and doesn’t really have any fear at all of being assaulted for any of these things...?

Then, they don’t have to try, nor put any fuckin’ thought into ANYTHING they do.
They could literally piss all over the bathroom floor and never actually in the toilet, that’s acceptable.

Sometimes, that’s what they call JUSTICE.
Pissing all over the bathroom floor INSTEAD OF, into the god damn toilet, calling it JUSTICE SERVED.

Oh wow.
If they get innocent people killed, or thrown in (jail/prison)...?
Oh well. What can anybody do about it...? 
It’s not like they actually give a shit. 
If they did...? They’d make damn certain they weren’t making mistakes.

On the other side of that coin...? 
Hillary never sees a day in prison, neither does Sackler.
Justice... lady justice wearin’ the blindfold, bein’ indifferent, see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil...
Well, it all spells out one thing... 1984.

That’s tyranny. 
It’s why 1776 happened, it’s why the shitty tea was kicked off into the harbor. 
It’s why America exists as it’s own “country”.
People really think that America is not currently under BRITISH RULE.
But, they’re morons to believe that, and they can’t understand how GAS and OIL, is the REASON WHY.

Some colonists felt like a better alternative was to kick the shit out of condescending, lying douchebags 
with authority. So for instance, the BRITISH ARMY just got the shit kicked out of them. 
Many soldiers in the British army, they were killed with extreme prejudice for making this mistake over,
and over again. Now look at the way Britain treats us.

They respect us NOW, don’t they...?
Well, no they don’t.
They’re just very good liars.
They enjoy watching every single episode of “Americans losing their fucking minds, blaming guns or whatever”

Someone caught a fuckin’ uppercut to the jaw and got knocked out... 
Britain.
...when they woke up, they realized, "Maybe I shouldn’t be a condescending dickhead like that."
So they made every effort to do such a thing without being DETECTED.
Then from 1812 and onward...? 
America was under British rule again.
It’s a good thing that I write these documents, cause... 
Eric Schnackenberg could’ve experienced this phenomenon. Same with Trooper Borden.	

If they KNEW they were being offended, they can actually be manipulated into abusing their authority during 
a recording. If they KNEW they were being RECORDED, then their ultimate response may vary. 

BEFORE they knew they were being recorded, they might’ve tried to arrest you for offending them...
...luckily, they barely understood it. 

AFTER  they knew they were being recorded, they’re unlocking the handcuffs, hoping you don’t file a lawsuit... 
...but this is actually rare. 

These people don’t know how to act when they’ve been caught red handed committing a crime, or just being a 
fuckin’ asshole. That’s why assaulting someone that does this, has to be done with documents like this.

$Book.AddSection(9,"Flashback [~] Eric Schnakenberg M.D. 1783 Route 9 Ste 204, Clifton Park, 12065",@"
Eric Schnakenberg, my family doctor for about 4-5 years, that my former doctor Susan Ferarry from SPARC Cohoes,
recommended because I used to be prescribed BUPHRENORPHINE/Suboxone. I was a patient at SPARC for over 6 years, 
on and off. Had a really good rapport with Jennifer Mansky, the former director of the clinic.

Ethyl Duncan used to write my prescription for Ritalin/Concerta. Then I switched to Adderall.
Weird thing is...? After I was PROPERLY DIAGNOSED...? My illicit drug use seemed TOTALLY CONTROLLABLE.

Yeah, the REHAB CLINIC INDUSTRY DOES NOT WANT PEOPLE TO BE OFF OF THE REHABILITATION PROGRAM.
Unless you’ve put thousands upon thousands of dollars into their pockets.
It would be IMMORAL for them to state openly, and candidly, WHY they will work very hard to bury the ROOT CAUSE.

Anyway... I told Jennifer Mansky that the whole entire program is a sick joke. She didn’t disagree with me.
I remember the bittersweet final conversation with this woman, who was lookin’ out for me that whole time. She 
and I both knew that a lot of people die after this conversation. She knew that it might be the last time she’d 
ever see me. She was taking a leap of faith, I doubt she cares about her patients as much as she did about me. 

Not long after that, I asked Dr. Schnakenberg to write me a prescription for the SAME EXACT CONDITION that my 
SON has. ADHD. Weird thing is...? This dude had NO PROBLEM writing a prescription for my kid. Not for me. 
Me...? Needing the same thing...? Instead of doing illicit drugs...? Oh man, nah. No fuckin’ way, buddy. 
Nuh-uh bro. He’s a doctor that praises the whole ‘holistic’ doctor approach. But- he’ll prescribe SUBOXONE. 

So, if YOU are like ME, and YOU get yourself OFF of that medicine...? Congrats. He still wont write the SINGLE 
FATHER, who GOT OFF OF SUBOXONE, the same exact medicine that he’ll write to the child. How cool is that...? 
Dude probably couldn’t bear the pain of being punched in the face. It’s probably scary for him to think of stuff 
like that. Somebody might ask me... “Why you gotta keep dropping his name like that...?”

Cause he deserves to be INSULTED, and SO DO MANY OTHER PEOPLE who think JUST LIKE HIM.

He doesn’t realize why I keep insulting him, because he needs to be taken down several pegs. 
A lot of people need this actually. 

Being taken down several pegs by some random person should happen a lot more frequently. 
I gather that few people are ever as successful as I will be by distributing this document/book.
Because I see a lot of morons everywhere I look. 
Every day. 

I get the feeling that people don’t allow themselves to be taken down ANY pegs. 
They get this sense of entitlement, it’s actually EGREGIOUS, DANGEROUS, and causes problems for society.
Morons like him, just don’t understand how they are directly compounding the issue, just like Judge Pelagalli.
So, everybody needs to be FORCIBLY shoved into checkmate.
You lost.
You get to lose a lot more than your medical license.
You might go to prison.
A lot of people are gonna lose something like that.
The problem is, I need to convince a group of like-minded individuals that have access to weapons, armor, 
infantry, equipment, handcuffs, gavels, badges, basically a CONSTITUTIONAL MILITIA.

One that is more prepared to die than the actual police, because they ARE the actual police.
The ones that ARE actual enlisted soldiers, or formerly served as an actual veteran in the
U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marines, or U.S. Air Force.
We need to provide a forcibly provisioned “Integrity check”.

It will be no different from running a command line interface “sfc /scannow”.
It effectively looks for everything about a given individual.
Guys like Schnakenberg will realize that people do give a shit.
And he’s gonna wind up apologizing to me at some point later after people take serious offense to his...
“spinelessness”.

I asked him for help regarding my incident with SCSO, and the man refused to listen to the audio recording 
I made, of (3) dudes from SCSO, committing a felony, and dragging me to Saratoga Hospital against my will.
Why...? Well, the police can commit criminal activities every day and never face consequences for it.
That’s why a CONSTITUTIONAL MILITIA needs to be formed every once in a while...

Because there are literal serial killers being protected by the police.
He didn’t give a flying fuck.

A couple of kids tried to murder me, on May 26th, 2020. He didn’t give a flying fuck.
Not only am I NOT making that up, but, I ACTUALLY SHOWED THE VIDEO TO TROOPER LEAVEY, and when I told 
DR. SCHNAKENBERG about that...? He literally stood up, and walked out of the fucking room.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Correlation",@"

I’m certain that it’s all tied together, and when I explain it in great detail, some people really are fuckin’
morons. Those same kids, attacked the Clifton Park Computer Answers network, that I was providing service for, 
on January 15th, 2019. 

So, it’s almost like someone keeps doing this shit to me... and the reason why they do it, is because they 
haven’t made their way to prison because the POLICE are PROTECTING them. 

So if you’re like me, and you deduce that your FATHER may have been EXECUTED by a MERCENARY that KEPT HIS 
MOUTH SHUT during a MURDER TRIAL that involved JOE PUGELISE in ALBANY... MAYBE, it doesn’t really take a 
lot of thought to consider...

MAYBE, somebody in CLIFTON PARK had something to DO with that MURDER... Hm. (← That is exactly what I believe)

Somebody had my father MURDERED, GOT AWAY WITH IT, and when I grew up, I saw a series of clues that indicated 
to ME... that somebody was behind HIS MURDER... and they started using EXPLOITS such as the GOD MODE CURSOR.
Felt like someone with the last name PICKETT.

Not DANIEL PICKETT... Nope. 
Not sure if it’s JESSE PICKETT – 785-3221...? 
But- I do think JOHN PICKETT has military experience, and heard the dispatcher on the night my father was 
murdered. And, had Sammy killed as well.

I GOT CURIOUS ENOUGH to START MAKING THOSE ACCUSATIONS, they made the mistake of TRYING TO GET ME TOO... 
...since they haven’t gotten shot to death yet... 

They’re gonna keep doing it, they’ve gotten thousands of people. 
I’m not special by any means... 

But- I’m the first person who is now hunting THEM. I’m like a bloodhound. You get caught in an avalanche...? 
I’m gonna find your ass because I’m rescuing the innocent victim that got covered by an avalanche. I’m gonna 
find your ass, and save your fuckin’ life. BUT- the person that should be the MOST worried, is the “Rich Brat”.

Cause you’re gettin’ executed by a U.S. Military Execution Squad, with EXTREME PREJUDICE. (← That means Gov’t)
That means, basically just like Osama Bin Laden was executed. 
No trial...? 
No judge...? 
Nothing.
They were the 1) Judge, 2) Jury, and 3) Executioner.

Weird. I’m gonna put a PIN in that for now, because I have no way to DIRECTLY LINK JOHN PICKETT to anything.
It’s just been a FEELING. 
DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS. (← That’s what gave you away, you overconfident fuckface.)

It’s been a while since these people have ATTACKED me, because I don’t think they’re doing that anymore. 
Still... people are making assumptions like Dr. Loeber, and Dr. Schnackenberg, and a bunch of other people.
Rather than to HURT people, for ignoring me over and over...? 
I’ll just keep writing up these documents and skits.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Compiling an effective motivator (1)",@"
Ted Cruz might not like reading about how Exxon Mobil shoves a huge veiny dick in that dudes asshole, 
but so long as he gets paid millions of dollars...? Ted Cruz will do it. So will Eric Schnackenberg. 
So will Sean Hannity.
Well... Sean Hannity doesn’t like getting his asshole stretched out, he’d rather gag on RUPERT MURDOCKs dick.
Scraping the “fromunda” cheese from his nutsack.
        
Now, I could be saying these things about my own doctor who treated me for several years, who also treated 
my children... But, I think the man should consider apologizing to me at some point, for being so shortsighted.
So, should Trooper Borden actually. 
Maybe he will one day after he eventually fucks a girl. 
I don’t know though. 

Might be being too hard on some lazy fuckface that had no idea that (2) dudes attempted to kill me right on 
Route 9, outside of the place where I used to work my ass off. Then, after I showed the video of that to a 
buddy on his own fucking team, my device was thrown into “disabled” status. 

Maybe all these people that I’ve insulted, they think they’ve worked a lot harder in life than I have. 
Keep tellin’ yourself that... I found out that one of the owners of the NFRASTRUCTURE Corporation, had some 
involvement in the MURDER/EXECUTION of my father, Michael Edward Cook, on October 23rd, 1995. 

There are things I cannot convey to other people, no matter how many words I write, that caused me to FEEL 
that there was something ELSE going on. Whether they were the words my dead father kept telling me. Or, they
were the long list of OBSERVATIONS I had made that caused me to believe theories that few people could ever
successfully piece together.

If anything, George W. Bush has a lot less to worry about from me, than JOHN PICKETT does.
Because it’s almost like I kept ‘accidentally’ running into additional clues, or perhaps it was fate...
...that everything would culminate into a stunning realization that someone else agreed with...
...because someone who has the world at his fingertips, knows that https://youtu.be/vmDVKwTF2Zc
...I was on the right track. And he doesn’t want his legacy to be impacted. He didn’t do anything.

I’m not gonna say who that person is, but it’s not Michael Neihaus.
I had a dream that this man spoke who the person I’m referring to, as well as a long list of other people
at Microsoft. Their name will remain <unlisted>.

As for COMPUTER ANSWERS, the guy that currently “works” there...? 
He slandered me, and now I can’t even kick his ass. Cause he will actually cry like a female, to *somebody*.
And, that’s ok. I can write these documents. He can’t. 
What works EVEN BETTER than writing up these documents is recording (AUDIO/VIDEO). 
Cause, what if people could hear Eric Schnakenberg refusing to listen to the audio recording of SCSO 
committing a FELONY to me...?

What if, all of the people that kept ignoring me, didn’t realize that someone really important listened to me.
 
The reason Eric Schnakenberg didn’t want to listen to the recording, is cause he prefers to read some of these 
documents instead. Where I may start to embarrass him. 
Do I embarrass myself...? Sure.
But people don’t consider the notion that I don’t give a flying fuck about things like embarrassment. 
I’m a wildcard, I’ll do that to MYSELF, and then bring YOU along with me. 
 
To make a joke about YOU, it’ll be a (serious-joke), where both aspects of being serious WHILE being funny 
are combined. Then people will realize that... most people don’t know how to do that. 
Because, that requires a basic understanding of superposition...

I mean, maybe somewhere, they have competitions where people wipe their ass.
Whoever does it best, they win.
The winning specimen gets framed, with a picture placed next to the …
Nah none of that happens. In direct contrast, what about something you could actually be proud of...?

Well... Cusato’s is a place that used to be in the plaza across the street from Computer Answers.
Used to go there all the time and see Betsy Feiden and this other real hot girl, can’t remember her name.
Lots of em, actually.
Anyway, they used to have this thing called the “Wall of Shame” or something.

The contest involved people having to eat an entire 24” round pie all by themselves... 
Like it was called a “Colossal” size, I think. 
If you fuckin’ failed to eat it all...?
Well, you needed to pay for that pizza. 
Then, you got a picture taken of you, and whatever you didn’t finish.
Everyone at Cusatos knew... that person was gonna be poopin’ for quite a while the next day.

Cusatos made the 2nd best pizza in Clifton Park... until it was sold.

The best pizza in Clifton Park, has always been made right across the street from Snyders Restaurant...
(Clifton Park Pizza | 1716 Route 9, Clifton Park, NY 12065)

...and the old County Courthouse at 1719 U.S. 9, where I first recorded the “digital bird”.
^ First memory in life, seeing that place, the old county courthouse. 
Although the abandoned building in Albany on I-787, “dry storage”, is basically in the same slot.

As for the County Courthouse...? Over the years, they’ve tried to make the surrounding area look better.
Or, do stuff with the landscape. But, I’ll tell ya, it’d probably make a real great location for something 
I’ll have to write a totally separate book about.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Compiling an effective motivator (2)",@"
As far as relevance, ideas, people, and compiling it all into an effective motivator, Dale Carnegies book isn’t
gonna work in every case. How to Win Friends and Influence People, is great when you want to understand the core
concepts of “mutually exclusive best-interest”. It’s great at that.

But there’s another shade of what Carnegie doesn’t talk about in the book and I could see it very clearly each
time I went to read it. So, I will explain what that other shade is...

Why does a citizen have to make a recording of THEM, and then ANNOUNCE that they’re making that recording... 
for them to REALIZE that ABUSING their AUTHORITY is ALWAYS a DUMB idea...?

Well, the reason that it will SEEM like a smart idea, is because you may be a dumbass like Dwayne.
A lot of people have this mentality where they just assume that no one will ever 1) know, or 2) care.
But- the reason why that mentality is pretty moronic, is because someone more intelligent will eventually
come along and 1) expose you.

So, if you’re intelligent, like I am, then ABUSING your AUTHORITY is NOT a SMART idea.
Because you don’t ASSUME that people are morons.

You expect that someone WILL be intelligent to catch you in the act, and then all of that effort to convince 
people OTHERWISE...? It collapses like a house of cards.

The one load bearing column is subjected to something like thermite, and explosives, and then the destruction 
is so surgically precise, effective, and total... that it takes down a 3rd building about a quarter mile away.

Now you’re REAL fucked, dude.

----

Let's assume that I’m just being poetic. 
Because, can’t expect people to draw up comparisons that are TOO effective...

However, that’s how the police are sometimes... Like Michael Chiklas and Walton Goggins in “The Shield”.
I am trying my best to make sure I don’t offend ALL of them, because...
...some of the police really aren’t doing anything malicious and that can be seen in MANY of the videos on
Audit the Audit.

There are some solid, cops with integrity, that take a page right out of Theodore Roosevelt’s precedent.

They’re harder and harder to identify and it’s because a lot of confusion circulates...
...when people adopt the mentality of “Oh what tangled webs we weave when we first practice to deceive.”

Basically, it requires A LOT MORE EFFORT to lie to people.
Because then you’re having to keep track of parallel lies and things that you told one perosn, but not the 
other, and then one person will say “But you told me THIS, not THAT...” and then they’re gonna realize that
you don’t remember what the hell you’re even saying or doing about anything...

Then you’re basically screwed and you have to just hold your hands up, and hope that everybody just FORGETS.
Some people won’t forget. They’ll remember.

I’m not saying that the police are all morons to offend ALL of them.
I’m saying it because if they believe someone that keeps lying to them...? 
Then they are FOOLS. Doesn’t mean they’re morons... it means: 
“You have something incorrect, someone is lying to you. They have every reason to do so.”

The police that I typically run into, are on the road all the time, and being in a vehicle is like wiping
your mind. It really is. When you’re in a vehicle, you miss a lot of details, and you’re HIGHLY DISTRACTED.
The radio may be going, you’ll see many other vehicles on the road, your eyes are darting all over the place, 
because you’re constantly on guard.

So, because they are the only police that I run into, I have to resort to making indications...
They really are not there to think hard. That isn’t their fault.
That is the way this system is designed.
They’re not there to enforce EVERY law.... just SOME of them.

Otherwise, JULIEN ASSANGE wouldn’t be sitting in prison with a 175 year prison sentence looming over his head.
Hillary Rodham “who gives a shit...?” Clinton, would be in prison.

So, just keep that in mind that the gripes are supposed to go UP as well as DOWN, so... 
Captain Miller in Saving Private Ryan... is wrong.
Gripes go up, and down.

Much how the movie Saving Private Ryan focuses on the PRINCIPLE rather than anything else...?
Well, somebody’s mother gave birth to a bunch of boys.
The government requested that they all serve in the military.
If all of them were to die because of this war...?

That woman would have spent her entire life, losing everything. 
Not unlike the woman in Schoharie in October 2018... when 20 kids died in a fuckin’ limo crash after a wedding.
Andrew “Sausage Wrecker” Cuomo did 100% (0) helpful things to prevent that situation from happening.

Too many people say “Nothing anybody could’ve done to prevent that...”
Nah. Captain Miller literally signed up to fuckin’ fulfill his generals orders.

The orders were to extract that (1) dude. The number of soldiers lost...? Is irrelevant.
The gripes were “Why send an entire team of dudes to extract the (1) guy...?”
Well, it’s because this was a war about fighting pure evil.
And, Julien Assange happens to be “Private Ryan”.

Same with Edward Snowden actually, but he at least knew how to EVADE being captured and thrown in prison for 
exposing some people in the government that are actively abusing these surveillance programs, so there will be
additional people that get killed by these serial killers, and they’ll be business owners, or college students,
or maybe just someone in the government that went against a big corporation like Apple, or Exxon Mobil.

Make no mistake, Capitalism has some serious fuckin’ problems. 
People are told, “laws shouldn’t be broken”, and then “unless you’re an exception”.
What makes someone an exception...? Being a “Rich Brat”.

So, if you’re a “Rich Brat”, then you’re a real exception... 
...and you will FAIL to understand one of the life lessons that Coach Careese always told me and the other kids... 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\    

Careese: When you work your ass off...?
         You’ll APPRECIATE what you’ve earned.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Otherwise, being “royalty” causes those people to act differently, where you don’t lead by example at all.
Those people have totally separate problems in life, because so many people just gravitate to them and they
don’t understand WHY, except for the fact that they have always had a lot of money in the family.

I gotta be careful with what I’m saying here, because being “RICH” doesn’t mean that you’re gonna buy a license
to the most dangerous spyware application in the world to spy on other people, and then become one of the most
elusive serial killers in existence, if anything...? 

Anyone with a solid head on their shoulders is gonna make it difficult on their own kids and not just give them
a “free pass” whenever they fail to learn from them their mistakes. If you’re a kid of a real rich bastard...? 
Then, you MAY be able to rape some girl at college in Florida, cause the FATHER will PAY the JUDGE to say:  
“He’s not a BAD kid... I mean, everybody rapes some girl at college, ya know...?” (← kid’s dad was exceptional)

NAH. That’s why the justice system is a fucking joke sometimes. That is a real scenario that happened, I can’t
remember exactly what his name was or the particular details... but, if 20 kids can die in a limo crash, and then
hire a lawyer to prevent him from going to prison... and wind up only getting probation...? That’s some straight 
up “Hey, I’m just like Bruce Tanski” shit right there. FBI probe managed to get him for (1) year probation.

What about Nicholas Dinova, or Paul Amato...? Or like, thousands of people TANSKI fraudulently ripped off...?
I’ll fuckin’ find a long list of names if this dude really wants me to dig into his shit.
What I know has a circle of people in CLIFTON PARK/HALFMOON and LOWER SARATOGA COUNTY connected, in a RICO.

Well, that dude is gonna be pretty worried about what I have to reveal.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Intent (4)",@"
Dude is part of a group of serial killers that have the FBI, SCSO, NYSP on lock.
Also, has several local businesses going around picking locks, breaking into security systems, using exploits, 
stealing intellectual property, stealing documents, deeds, records, titles, then has these serial killers kill
people in their sleep, dragging them out of their house, and then disposed of.

(1) year of probation because the people he paid off prevented him from receiving a worse sentence.
Now, they’re fuckin’ worried about me alright.

Cause the scams also include fraud, insurance fraud, life insurance fraud, identity theft, cybercrime, 
telecommunications fraud, property fraud, basically everything with the term FRAUD in it somewhere...? 
Tanski is involved with. And, I believe the Goldstein’s are involved in this as well.

THAT’S why they can just print off a spare “cop car” and have an “off duty” police officer drive around, 
bank to bank, picking up satchels of money JUST LIKE BRINKS.

LOOKS like an actual cop (because it is a cop), SOUNDS like an actual cop (because it is a cop), but-
...this particular cop is never on duty and just so happens to show up on a lot of calls.

JOHN HOFFMAN really kinda clued me in on how this all works, actually: 
- if someone fucks with one of his accounts
- his security team shows up before the police do
- and they will have everything ready for the police BEFORE they get there
- which means that the police aren’t actually doing any work
- OR, this is describing the holy sacred art, of (FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY/SLEIGHT OF HAND)

JOHN HOFFMAN said all of this all in front of:
01) me
02) my son
03) on May 25th, 2020 
04) BEFORE I walked to my Aunt Terri’s house
05) while holding a handheld meter for the water reading
06) adjacent to the rear entrance to Oak Brook Commons
07) across the street from Meyer Road, where Bruce Tanski lives.
08) adjacent to the Zappone dealership, basically right next to Meyer Road
09) that’s where SCSO-2020-028501 had SCSO Scott Shelling, Jeffrey Kaplan and Joshua Welch
10) after (2) dudes attempted to murder me for over 90 minutes and
11) disrupted (2) 911 calls I made,
12) near 1769 Route 9 where Zachary Karel lives, the guy who’s PHONE LINE I cut,
13) too bad the ONLY THING THE POLICE DID, was arrest me 5 days later for the kayak strap.

Cool. That’s how stupid these people really are. I mean, Michael Zurlo...? He’s a fuckin’ moron.

Somebody with a solid understanding of common sense who knows they did all this shit, they’ll tell their 
own kid: “You obviously did something to deserve what you’ve gotten.”

Now, here’s the cool part.
Bruce Tanski wouldn’t have the balls nor the intelligence to try and kill me himself.
Neither would John Hoffman.
Eric Catricala sure as hell would, cause he TRIED to on Fathers day in Voorheesville.
Not a smart dude, I’ll tell ya that much.
2 hours before Eric Catricala tried to kill me a mile away from my aunts house...? 
Well, I found the VEHICLE that was USED to try and run me over...

The vehicle that was in the video I recorded between (05/25/20 1143 → 05/26/20 0004)
...I recorded that the night my son and I spoke to John Hoffman.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"You sound like a broken record",@"
My mother always told me “You sound like a broken record”, or “I’ve heard all this before”.
The assumption she is attempting to convey is that “I don’t really care dude. Fuck you.”
Those statements do not convey “If somebody was trying to kill you, they would’ve done so by now.”
Because, she said that before too. 
After 3+ attempts...? 

I would’ve been dead by now if I didn’t “see that coming.”

My mother is quite a moron. I want to say worse things, but- she really has no idea that I literally am far more
intelligent than SHE, as well as EVERYBODY ELSE THAT HAS EVER KNOWN ME... believes. Not exaggerating.

There are some people that know how dangerously intelligent I am, and [they’ve stopped underestimating me*].
Because they know [I’m telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth... and they believe me*].

In the instance of what I said above, “You obviously did something to deserve what you’ve gotten.”
My mother said stuff like that to me, not realizing “Nah, I didn’t.”

Cause with enough MONEY, you could be an egregious business owner of a stretch limo company, and not make 
fuckin’ certain that your vehicles are being inspected and passing tests and stuff, but then one of your 
employees dies along with 20 kids in a fuckin’ SINGLE crash, because wow... 
Somebody wasn’t paying attention...~! 

That dude whipped out a fat stack of cash to get himself out of that whole ordeal, went from: 
(CAPITAL PUNISHMENT → NO PRISON, JUST PROBATION) ← That’s COOL. (SARCASM)
Yeah... so, what that tells me is that people can actually take a long, fruitful piss all over the flag...
“Fuck you lady justice. Fuckin’ stupid cunt.” ← That’s what some people say.

Naturally, that’s what pisses me off. 
The police do not enforce all laws, the courts do not consistently provision justice, the laws being written 
are not consistently enforced, sometimes a law is written to prevent someone from being tried and charged 
with TREASON, and everyones supposed to just pay their taxes, and if `$1T worth of equipment in Afghanistan 
gets commandeered by the Taliban...? 

Oh well dude. You need to pay your fuckin’ taxes, cause, morons told you that you have to. 
These morons make plenty of exceptions for themselves, they don’t take accountability for their mistakes, they 
don’t care what happens to people who are vicitimized, as long as it’s not THEM...

And they will blindly follow some moron that decides to commit treason against his own country if it means 
that his buddies were to gain TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF OIL. (← That’s COOL)

Yeah, I don’t think that George W. Bush was INNOCENT AT ALL.

So here’s how JUSTICE works in the United States...
If Hillary Rodham “Who gives a shit...?” Clinton leaks classified information, kills a long list of people, 
passes the SAFE Family Care Act, covers up many crimes, she won’t even get community service. Nah.
Cause, why...? Well, I’ll tell you why.

People like her piss all over the Constitution every day.
Takes a huge shit, and uses the Constitution to wipe her ass.
Tells people that they’re fuckin’ criminals, and when she is even worse...? Doesn’t hold herself accountable.
That’s why I call her Hillary Rodham “Who gives a shit...?” Clinton.

But if YOU happen to leak classified information...? Like she did...?  
That’s 175 years. Just like Julien Assange.

^ That’s JUSTICE. Well, it’s actually INJUSTICE, but it’s the same thing in America, because...
See no evil, Hear no evil, Speak no evil... just do it. Who gives a shit...?
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Ultimatum",@"
If Eric Schnackenberg sees someone and decides to tell that person to fuck off... 
...he’ll get `$500 bucks to do that.
If I work my ass off and outperform all of the people at Computer Answers...
...I’ll support everyone elses’ family and then have my employer commit labor fraud.
    
See the difference...? Eric doesn’t work that hard, if ever.
I can work a lot harder than he does, and get shit for it.
    
Same concept applies to the police that I recorded on 05/23/20...
...leaving their cruisers running idle for a while...
...05/25/20. 

Then 12 hours later, a couple cocksuckers tried to murder me and they had my device hacked so when I called 
911 twice...? Well, 911 didn’t answer. It WAS contacted, and the call DID go through.
BUT- it was ANSWERED and then somebody left it on MUTE.
What if a 911 operator was CAUGHT DOING THAT...?
Oh...

The reason I would cut somebody’s fucking phone line at 1769 Route 9, is because...
I spent that WHOLE FUCKIN TIME, trying to flag someone down for help because I was ACTIVELY BEING HUNTED.
    
If I tell the police, they won’t write a report nor look at the fuckin’ photos or video I took.
Then when I tell Eric, he’ll be a cocksucker about it too.
    
The difference happens to be, that the lawmen can choose to ignore when the law is broken. 
EVEN IF THE LAW BEING BROKEN IS VERY SEVERE. Such as:

[Conspiracy to commit murder]: basically, you knew it was happenin’, and it went down because maybe somebody was
bouncing around amongst the pegs in a Plinko machine. The ball just wound up bouncing until it got ALL the way to 
the bottom, right...? BUT- what if you’re the type of asshole JOHN PICKETT is, and you knew that a different guy 
like, ACED his military entrance exam... and you fuckin kinda sucked ass so badly at taking yours, that you like, 
SWAPPED your exam with theirs... Nobody would ever really KNOW, right...? Or, maybe that’s a metaphor. Maybe the 
Plinko analogy sounds better. Somebody put a SINGLE piece of wood right down near the bottom so that the ball 
that was actually DESTINED to WIN...? Well, you fuckin’ had to be a small 7nm peckered douchebag... And fucked it
all up. Somebody that SHOULD’VE gotten home safely...? Well, you cheated somebody. Now you’re REAL fucked, dude. 

[Committing first degree murder]: keeping a piece of tape over your mouth in the form of pleading the fifth 
amendment is essentially the reason a contracted mercenary took a job that resulted in his life imprisonment.
One of the BIGGEST CLUES THAT I OBTAINED THAT NO ONE ELSE IN MY FAMILY WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN... was the LOOK on:
Tyrell Crawford’s face when I spoke to him about a decade ago at Sing-Sing correctional facility. Yeah.
Craig “Kill on sight” Nelson, drove me down there that day. Craig was cool but had an issue lying all the time.
Anyway, I remember talking with Tyrell. I remember the look on his face when I said a particular sentence to him.
The look of HORROR on his face told me that he had no idea why my father did what he did. My father EXPECTED that.
That was the look I saw on Tyrell Crawfords face “SO THAT EXPLAINS FUCKING EVERYTHING...” (← Why I should be 
an OFFICIAL investigator)

[Committing Treason]: Law men kinda let that one slide. Osama Bin Laden did attack those buildings. He was also 
manipulated into doing so. 1) Exxon Mobil joined forces with the (CIA/MI5)... 2) installed explosives and 
thermite in all (3) buildings that collapsed in lower Manhattan, 3) shot a GUIDED CRUISE “Ted Cruz” MISSILE 
into the Pentagon (killing 125 + Lt. Gen. Timothy Maude*), 4) sent the (2) planes that struck WTC 1, 2 from 
Albany Airport, 5) the (2) Boston planes were landed somewhere in NE, or NY, then those people were killed 
with some sort of nerve gas (R. Roth analyzed 911 calls, discovering a MORE COMPELLING explanation).

(4) total planes were involved in the disillusionment of the American people, and the media.
(2) other planes were commandeered elsewhere, such as the one that “crash landed” in Shanksville.
Pretty difficult to convince people that planes landed in a place where NO FUSELAGE WAS FOUND.
American democracy was overthrown on 09/11/01, to convert America into the hands of “The New World Order”

[censorship of “Collateral Murder”]: This occurred basically because somebody made a fuckin’ mistake. Instead of 
taking accountability for that mistake, somebody decided to be a fuckin douchebag about it, and tried to play it
off like “Oh well, I accidentally killed a bunch of people that weren’t terrorists at all.” That wasn’t the REAL 
issue... Nah, the real issue was DENYING THAT THEY MADE A MISTAKE, and then TRIED TO COVER IT UP, and then DENIED
REUTERS FOIL REQUEST, because then that means innocent people can just get killed, and nobody has to say: 
“SORRY BRO... MY BAD.”

[censorship of millions of citizens on Facebook]: Facebook is a weapon. It was not ORIGINALLY intended, to be 
one, but one day Mark Zuckerberg saw himself in the mirror, and said “I could totally commandeer society...”
...and then that’s what he did. I think that my theory about him going around stealing intellectual property
from people is more than just unnervingly spot on, I believe he has some involvement in the use of 
PEGASUS/PHANTOM to attempt to murder me on (05/25/20 → 05/26/20), AND, has done this to so many other people, 
that it has CAUSED PERMANENT DAMAGE to the FABRIC of AMERICAN SOCIETY. I think that despite Frances Haugen’s 
best attempt to indicate that there are some serious fuckin’ problems at Facebook... The problems are able to be
SEEN here...

The BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH is because of FACEBOOK. So, if FACEBOOK CAN DO THAT SHIT...?
THEN NO DOUBT CAN THEY HEAVILY INFLUENCE THE COMMUNICATION OF PEOPLE IN A “DEMOCRATIC” SOCIETY.
Cause it’s actually a FASCIST society, that’s unable to SEE the shit that they do over in RUSSIA...
In ZUCKERBERG’S case, I think he is a legitimate sociopath that has serious psychological issues.
And, he probably is associated to the fuckin’ document that somehow made it to my Google Drive account,
which has like, the RECORDS REQUEST FROM SCSO, that I received on 09/08/20, and the fuckin thing is like
HEAVILY MODIFIED and has a RANGE of font sizes, colors, shapes, etc. This is because it’s a CLUE that HE,
is THREATENED by the STREAM of the POLICE OFFICERS that have been watching me WRITE THIS BOOK.

[facilitation of an attempted murder]: MICHAEL ZURLO is definitely the dude who’s goin’ down for this.
I’ve already spoken about it numerous times, the problem is that at any given time, he could’ve been
arrested for doin’ this... right...? But- the PROBE wanted to ensnare ADDITIONAL PEOPLE and VERIFY the 
INVOLVEMENT of OTHER OFFICERS. That’s why there was an OFFICER from SCSO that wasn’t listed on the 
incident from 07/14/20: SCSO-2020-040845 | SCSO: A. Agresta, P. Zurlo | NYSP: 2G36, 2G62, 2G32

[conspiracy to commit murder]: RYAN WARD → My cousin, basically held some type of grudge all these years,
I never realized how deeply it influenced RYAN, that I almost fucked his girlfriend once upon a time. I 
really shouldn’t state it like that, cause, she would’ve been my first girlfriend, actually. Ya know...? 
I had my reasons for being hesitant to do that, to him specifically. But- people have fucked up morals man.
The point being, would Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt fuckin’ do that to his cousin...? Probably not. Cause if
HIS cousin did that shit to him...? He’s gonna be knockin some motherfucker out in a single punch.

[mail fraud]: Theodore Roosevelt didn’t fuck around. He didn’t really like when people lied to him. OR, 
thought they were fuckin’ real slick. So, people wound up getting punched in the fuckin’ face when he 
showed up. He’s gonna be charging that person he punched in the face with a million dollar fine. Cause 
now he’s gotta ice his fuckin hand down. Dude punched a lot of people that thought they could get away
with some shit. Then he showed up, unannounced. He asked people a single question.

Roosevelt : Why haven’t you returned my mail...? 
Bruce     : Buddy, my system says that it was mailed to you.
Roosevelt : OH, the system says that...? 
            Huh. 
            I have a feeling that you’re lying to my face.
Bruce     : Nah, I’d never do that to ya.
Roosevelt : *stares into this dude’s soul* 
            *punches DENNIS BRUCE in HIS face knocking him unconscious* 
            *drags his unconscious body up to Judge Paul Pelagalli’s office*
            *pounds on this motherfucker’s door* 
Pelagalli : *opens the door*
            What the hell is goin’ on here...? 
Roosevelt : Hey, Mr. Pelagalli, right...?
Pelagalli : Yeah, you know you’re gonna get in a lot of trouble for dragging that dude around like that...
Roosevelt : Nah, I’m the President of the United States, dumbass.
Pelagalli : Alright... what can I *nervous* do for ya...? 
Roosevelt : Sent your ass a letter.
            Didn’t get a response from YOU.
            This dipshit tried to tell me that the letter was sent.
            So I had to knock his ass out.
            So, that’s 1x million dollar fine so far.
            I’m gonna ask you 1 time.
            Why haven’t you returned my mail...? 
Pelagalli : I could SWORN I mailed that thing out... I believe.
Roosevelt : Nah, I’m gonna ask you one more time.
            Cause I always know when I’m being lied to.
            Why haven’t you returned my mail...? 
Pelagalli : *flustered* ALRIGHT! 
            I didn’t send it, cause I didn’t think it was that important.
Roosevelt : Explain yourself.
Pelagalli : Look dude... 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

At that point, Paul Pelagalli has to convince former president Theodore Roosevelt from not knocking his ass out.
He’s still gonna get slapped with a charge for MAIL FRAUD, which will immediately relinquish his ability to be
a judge from that point forward, AND, his entire caseload is immediately dropped entirely.
Because that’s basically a FEDERAL CRIME right there, so if the system says “WE MAILED IT OUT”, but it never
actually got flagged at a single post office...? That’s actually a criminal activity that occurred.
So, you can’t expect some lazy, limp-dicked douchebag like MICHAEL ZURLO to enforce a law like that. NOPE.

Regardless... I’m closing in on the end of this chapter, “Rich Brat”.

Does Eric Schnackenberg know about any of that shit...? Nah. Probably doesn’t.
Nobody at Exxon Mobil had to worry about prison time, either.
Some of these charges, suspicions, and cases have been handled SOMEWHAT.
Not all of them.
    
If the law men can SELECTIVELY enforce a law, then people can SELECTIVELY commit crimes.
If they SELECTIVELY have to worry about being caught, then they can SELECTIVELY tell people to fuck off.

So, if some law man ACTUALLY tries to slap some cuffs on somebody after NOT SEEING THE CRIME THAT SOMEONE ELSE 
COMMITTED...? Then, that person they are attempting to SLAP SOME CUFFS ON, should be able to OFFICIALLY attack 
that police officer in self defense, and then ARREST that police officer. And then, CHARGE them with a FELONY.
Not really allowed to be a police officer after that, either.

If the LAW wasn’t broken at all by the person being ACCUSED of a crime... BUT- someone decided to MANUFACTURE 
EVIDENCE that FRAMES a PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL, then what happens is that THOSE PEOPLE that are MANUFACTURING 
THAT EVIDENCE have to start being: ATTACKED.

Not with weapons and shit, cause that’s what morons will do. That will scare people. 
THEODORE ROOSEVELT never killed anybody by punching them in the face. Nope. 
MIGHT LEAVE a pretty big black and blue welt mark...? But that’s not gonna kill ANYBODY.

Does Eric Schnakenberg know about any of that shit...? Nah. Probably doesn’t. Probably thinks that being 
punched in the face COULD kill him. Same with RICHARD TODD LOEBER.

As for Hillary Rodham “Who gives a shit...?” Clinton, she should be in prison already. 
Key term “SHOULD BE”. Reality...? Isn’t. 
With that logic, Andrew “Don’t touch me, grandpa” Cuomo SHOULD be in prison already, as well.
So would Donald Trump, considering his association with VLADIMIR PUTIN, CROSSFIRE HURRICANE, and THE TALIBAN. 
So would George W. “Sausage Lips” Bush, considering he is suspected of COMMITTING TREASON.

But- the reason none of this shit has happened yet, is because somebody has to convince the rest of the country,
that there’s a real BRITISH MONARCHY VIBE to the INJUSTICE occurring all across the board. 
Nobody has successfully done this quite yet. Not to my knowledge anyway.

When I was younger, I did think that these things couldn’t possibly happen.
Because I was taught, that this is the fuckin’ United States of America.
Home of the free, land of the brave.

NOW, I know better... The USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001 turned our country into something else.
I know that there were hidden messages that whole time... 
...messages that JUST SO HAPPENED to APPEAR as if...
...it might’ve just been oceans worth of jizz on a few dudes faces.

Other people didn’t see it, and they probably will never understand the fucking metaphor either.
Point blank, while there MAY have been some jizz on somebody’s face...?
The guys who ran the United States...? 
They weren’t fuckin’ gay by any means, and there was no jizz on ANY of their faces at all.

You have to be basically ROYALTY, in order to matter to people. 
If you’re not...? Oh well, dude. 
Fuck you. 

If your father is murdered execution style by (3) black kids, and you don’t really ever use the word NIGGER, 
there’s a fairly good chance that you’re not racist. 
But, doesn’t really matter if he got killed, what matters is that you’re expected to raise yourself. 
Teach YOURSELF about the world, and if you don’t feel like doing any of that?
Oh well, dude. Fuck you.

That’s what people have told me my entire life, “Oh well, dude. Cry about it...? And, fuck you.”
But that becomes a pretty dangerous thing to say if you aren’t expecting to be punched immediately afterward.

They seem to think that if you work your whole life and bust your ass... you’ll be alright.
In my case...? People have taken advantage of me for my entire life. Made me out to be a scapegoat. 
Lied about me. Accused me of things I didn’t do. Murdered my father. Told that didn’t matter. Grow up.
I eventually started using drugs because after my father was murdered... didn’t really care about being social.

Does Eric Schnakenberg know about any of that shit...? Nah. Probably doesn’t.
    
I think people believed that I was always a social outcast or weird, but I was typically the smartest 
person in my class. After my father died, I stopped caring about my school or grades. 
When I started using, I started to be more outgoing.

However, I really doubt that anyone on the list of people up above ever had it as rough as I did...
So, when I get snarky or start being an asshole...? I’m not acting that way for no reason.		
I’m acting that way because I may wind up punching people in the face.
    
You can’t expect anybody to do anything.
So if the police are not being very attentive to detail...? 
They’re not gonna give a shit about Ted Cruz being paid bribery money. 
Especially if the they can’t read a dictionary. 
I didn’t think that READING A DICTIONARY, was actually DIFFICULT...?
But some of these guys cause me to shake my head and then think about whipping one out for em.
Definition (WORD TYPE : What the word actually means)

Maybe it isn’t difficult and you just have to catch some of them while they’re not looking, and record their 
expressions. They won’t actually know that they’re being recorded, and THAT is when they’re actually honest.

Which is why understanding DRAMATURGY is VERY IMPORTANT.
Same goes for psychological manipulation.
I can’t say that ALL of the police act this way at all, as the ones that deserve respect...? 
I notice that shit pretty quickly.

TROOPER RIZZANO, deserves some respect.
Cause guys that aren’t like him...? 
They sure as hell don’t seem to know the definition to a lot of words.

$Book.AddSection(9,"Excerpt [~] Room for one more...",@"
If Ted Cruz WAS being bribed, they will ALSO reason, that if this were the case...
...somebody would’ve arrested Ted Cruz by now. 
    
However, that is exactly what I mean by hiding in plain sight, and why I say this repeatedly: 
most people aren’t very bright. 

The assumption being made, is that SO MANY PEOPLE would’ve DONE something about it already...       (← FALLACY ALERT)
 ...if Ted Cruz was accepting bribery.

However there is an EXCEPTION that makes itself VERY APPARENT, when NOBODY ever handles it...
...because EVERYONE MADE THAT ASSUMPTION.

SOMEONE ELSE already would’ve handled it by now.                                                    (← FALLACY ALERT)
You’re right. 
A police officer was bribed IN ADDITION TO Ted Cruz, that’s why NEITHER ONE got slapped with charges.
That’s how someone else “HANDLED” it. But, think about how stupid that is...

Now, compound that throughout 50 states, right...? 
All counties in each state. 
All towns in teach county. 
Now, add all of them together...
...that is the total aggregate number of people that assumed that if Ted Cruz was being paid bribery money...
...that someone in any of those fuckin’ places would’ve taken action by now... 
...except, that’s just how many morons there are. 

They haven’t taken any action yet at all. 
That’s cause NOBODY handled it at all. 
Cause they’re morons. 
A lot of people ASSUMED it would get handled...? 

But- it didn’t get handled. 
That’s what being a bunch of morons leads to. 
It’s like the story “room for one more”...		

Room for one more, is basically the story about how some guy had a dream where he was in a terrible plane crash, or 
car crash, or whatever... and when he wakes up he’s in a panic. He spends a while being oblivious to what’s goin’ on 
around him, until he’s asked a question by somebody, that causes him to remember his dream.

Now the metaphor with that, is this... dude caught a bad vibe or a feeling. A sixth sense that said something was 
fuckin’ wrong after all. That- happens to me quite a lot. But anyway, trusting his gut or intuition, he backs off... 
He doesn’t get in the (plane/car/train), there’s multiple derivatives of this story.

Anyway, that (plane/car/train) happens to crash not long after it leaves. It kills everyone on board.
So... this happens to me a lot. I get that strange sensation that something is terribly wrong, and all of those 
people that got on the fuckin’ (plane/car/train), they were calling ME the paranoid asshole, and that I need to 
get along with the fuckin’ program... right? But- then they all got themselves killed.

The moral of the story is that a group of people will think:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Group : There’s NO fuckin’ way...
        ...that this (1) guy is smarter than ALL of us...
        ...or is MORE CORRECT than ALL of us...
        ...cause we’re a group of people that all think something TOTALLY different.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Right, and that’s why I get pissed off with people.
Because, I happen to fit this description quite a lot. 
If a bunch of people doubt me...? 
That’s totally fine. 

But, people should really consider PLACING BETS on my PERFORMANCE, cause... 
I’d make some people a LOT of fucking money. (← God damn certain of it)

People will bet against the odds.
They’ll lose A LOT of fuckin’ money doing that.
What if people did that with my situation...?

Somebody was watching me for a while with an advanced tool. 
I had a strange feeling over and over...
...somebody was ACTIVELY WATCHING what I was doing on the COMPUTER or on my SMARTPHONE... 
Especially after they made a serious mistake on January 15th, 2019. (← FATAL ERROR)

Assumptions, and being wrong quite often... 
...that’s really just how ignorant the police and most people, are.

It’s the main reason why I don’t like to talk to people anymore. 
A lot of people are actually that stupid, because they gauge their accuracy on what everyone else thinks.
So, if everybody except ONE DUDE is wrong... they won’t even fuckin’ consider that to be correct.
That’s why “Room for one more...” is the story of my life.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Summary (3)",@"
So, if the police say "If Ted Cruz was accepting bribery, he would’ve been arrested by now"
You have to tell them "That’s YOUR JOB, dipshit."
And, if they don’t feel like doing their job... 
...then what is the fuckin’ solution...? 

Talking about 1776, and why some people got what they deserved. (← BRITISH MONARCHY)

In Ted Cruz’s case, he’s ok with making a compromise. 
A dick in his asshole, getting thrown in there way too often, is a compromise he can make.
So what if it gets chafed up real bad and starts bleeding...? 
He fuckin’ LIKES that.
He’s ok with that... he gets millions of dollars for doin’ that.

If I try to tell people that, that might make people laugh.
But not if I am being heavily censored, because someone sees me as a political opponent. 
Which forces me to use VARYING ALTERNATIVE of distribution. 
In this process, even god damn Dr. Oliver fuckin’ Robinson, superintendent of a school district...
...DOES NOT SEE THE FUCKING PROBLEM.

         ...to say that he likes getting his asshole pounded out by Exxon Mobil.
Zurlo : *chuckles* That sounds insane though buddy.
Me    : Maybe you’re just a fuckin’ moron though... ya know?

The reason why it didn’t make sense to the police officer, is NOT because it was senseless... 
It was because the person wearing the BADGE, wasn’t paying close enough attention. 
It’s cause, sometimes they expect to be respected even if they have a smidge of jizz-on-the-chin.
Happens a lot actually.

Because, that requires EFFORT. 
EFFORT, is something they prefer not to APPLY very often, if ever at all.
Cause from where I’m standing, it looks like they’ll apply EFFORT at sending Michael Whitacre to
5 Chelsea Place, and take a report that’s NON-ARRESTABLE.
Lots of these fuckin’ NON-ARRESTABLE reports that LOOK bad...?
...but it’s basically me going around using my freedom of expression.

Like, if I’m not threatening to kill someone SPECIFICALLY...
...then nothing I write can be used against me.
UNLESS, someone were to be mad lame/gay, and take shit out of context.
But- that usually indicates someone with malicious intent.
That’s when that idea totally backfires.

Something “Backfiring” has a whole “jizz-on-their-chin” aspect to it.
If there is jizz on their chin, do you really think that telling them, will change anything...?
    
The thing is, they will definitely apply some effort if you insult them.

Me     : Hey, Trooper Borden...
Borden : What’s up, pal...? 
Me     : ...you got a lil *points* smidge of jizz on your chin there, bub...
Borden : *moves hand to chin to check* No I don’t...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Trooper Borden didn’t realize, that’s how easy it was to manipulate him. 
Cause when he MOVED his actual HAND, to check...?
That’s like an immediate indication...
...someone’s physically checkin’, and makin’ sure.

Sometimes this type of manipulation is required, so that Trooper Borden uses his hand to check real quick...
It’s a better alternative than him getting his ass kicked, and me goin’ to jail.

Because I’ll remember how he actually moved his hand to CHECK... right...?
And then I’ll remember that the dude actually moved his hand.
It’s a better alternative than causing the people to feel like...
...I MUST be some unhinged lunatic that may one day, just, suddenly choose to go shoot up Tops.     (← FALLACY ALERT)

Right...? 
USUALLY using MUST in a sentence like that, is an indication that it’s a (fallacious statement/bad logic).
I can say that I’m not that guy, but some people are morons, taught to use these fallacious statements.
So, they keep dragging me back into that category... 
...because they’re the same thing as a mentally challenged person who doesn’t understand the punchline of a joke.

So, I have to insult them for doing that...
If they can censor me, or label me something I’m not, they are therefore manipulating ME...
...and violating my constitutional rights.

The police don’t care about constitutional rights sometimes. 
Go ahead and watch that YouTube channel “Audit the Audit” and you’ll find out pretty fuckin’ quickly, I’m correct.
They can accuse me of having a gun, even if I don’t fuckin’ have one... and then shoot me dead. 
And they can say "Whoops, my bad bro."
    
So, it’s a very REAL situation for ME... to know that I have to OUTSMART people...
...that have probably half the intelligence that I do...
...so that people don’t get physically injured. 

So, manipulating Trooper Borden to move his hand to check his chin for some jizz...? 
That’s gonna wind up being quite comedic, once people realize that the truth is stranger than fiction. 

I’ve just explained how America is currently operating exactly like 1776, AND... 
...explained how to resolve that conflict without physically hurting people.

Some of these people actually like the idea, of someone hurting innocent people.
Because THEN, they have SOMEBODY to BLAME. 
But, then that means someone gets to SUFFER... 
...because some asshole like Trooper Carter ignored leads or evidence.
But, so did Trooper Borden...
So did a lot of people...

Then, (2) guys that used a program called Pegasus to try and murder me...?
One day, Trooper Borden found out that they both went missing. 
Uh-oh. 
Where’d they go Borden..?!?

Well... Trooper Borden (supposedly) knew what game was being played... 
He decided it was time, to arrest me with NO EVIDENCE. Why...? 
Well, Trooper Borden knew who was trying to kill me, since I showed him the license plate NYS/DVA-2450. 
NOW, they’re missing...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Borden : This... feels like that Michael C. Cook guy... 
         Both of these guys? 
         Missing? 
         That’s... the LAST fuckin’ straw pal...
         *came to my house*
         *pounds on the door*
Me     : *opens the door*
Borden : Michael Cook...?
Me     : That’s me. 
         Whats up cocksucker...?
Borden : Step outside for me, if you would.
Me     : What for...?
Borden : I’m gonna ask you again, step outside if you would.
Me     : *steps outside, not worried or anything*
Borden : Place your hands behind your back.
Me     : Why... 
         What the hell...?

I don’t doubt for a minute that he would literally try to do this.
Even if I was live streaming in a totally different fuckin’ state.
He will work his ass off to pull me through a fucking wormhole, and somehow accuse me of being at some place...
...4 hours AFTER I spent 16 straight hours recording a continuous video in the state of Washington.

If it sounds fuckin moronic...?
Oh well, dude.
He’s gotta try...

Now, Trooper Borden doesn’t actually follow the protocol at all here in that scene above. 
Wanna know why...?
He hasn’t even collected any evidence or alibis yet. 
He’s making an assumption where... 
...these guys could’ve fuckin’ drove off the side of a bridge, into a river... 
...and THAT’S why they went missing...
...but he didn’t collect any evidence or anything like that to determine that I must’ve done something...
...cause I talked about it over and over...
...so, I gotta be guilty SOMEHOW, right...?

Well, no. 
I mean, they fuckin’ hang out quite a bit, right?
They’re brothers.
There’s no fuckin’ way that these (2) guys wouldn’t be stroking each other’s dicks...
...as they drove into the side of a Beeteljuice bridge, and then got dropped into a river...
...and THEN they died... 
...right...? 

Well, think again fuckface. 
Trooper Borden jumped the gun...
It’s strange. 
They may actually do this shit to some people, I don’t question it for a fuckin’ minute.
I know they will actually fabricate evidence and testimony.
So, making a stretch to frame someone for murder, when clearly, the REAL evidence CONSISTENTLY indicates otherwise.
Everyone else might believe the manufactured evidence and the falsified conviction... 
...except people that they do this shit to... 
...everyone will think that’s just THEIR opinion...
...as long as they’re in jail...?  
...then their opinion isn’t all that important to the rest of society. 

That is the life of the FALSELY ACCUSED. 

Anyway, that’s basically the same job that some of the public defenders have. 
- assume that their clients are guilty 
- offer the least helpful outcome they can

Cause even if their client is TOTALLY INNOCENT...?
- that’s something they should be paying a LAWYER to PROVE

That doesn’t mean that they don’t look for the most amicable resolution possible...?
Cause between Frederick Wrench, and Michael Carota, they got the cases dismissed.

They got paid for that.
The system sorta lost money on that deal, because the police just fabricated some shit out of thin air.
Meanwhile, Dwayne Coonradt, he called his buddy instead of 911.
Then, his buddy decided to call in an actual 911 emergency instead of passing it off the ACTUAL way.
I know that’s what happened on August 5th, 2020, because of the way he stated his conversation.
He called his BUDDY.
NOT 911.
Pretty sure, anyway.

But, suppose I had the 911 operators phone number... 
Well, maybe that’s why my 2x 911 calls were IGNORED on (05/26/20).

                 I’m not answering YOUR 911 call...
                 Cause, you’re a fuckin’ REAL asshole bro.
                 If Dwayne calls me though...? 
                 Oh, I’m gonna make damn certain that call gets answered.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

There’s only (1) person who would casually state that they will eventually be victims, 
...and Trooper Borden remembered that I stated that those (2) guys that tried to (murder me) and 
(blocked my 911 calls) are gonna (get themselves killed).

Now, he doesn’t even NEED any proof, because... why would he? 
He may not actually BE gay, he just ACTS that way. 
That’s why.

But also, people see that shit all the time on TV cop shows, where police collect evidence and stuff...?
Since they HEAR about it being a LEGIT thing written in the CONSTITUTION... 
...then they’ll believe that shit exists if they see it on TV...
So, that means citizens will act ENTITLED. 

I mentioned elsewhere, the real police don’t work like the TV cops do.
Many times, they act nearly identical to “The Shield”
    
America, has a soap opera called "the justice system".
This soap opera, the actors are the lawyers, judges, police officers, and they are fuckin’ damn good at acting. 
All of them. 

Unless someone like me sees the charade and starts writing about it, and then some idiots overextend themselves.
America, used to thrive on things like "a fair trial", or "testimony", or "evidence". 

It doesn’t do that anymore. Not unless you’re spending some money. Then it works.
If you don’t...? Then the “system” calls itself “fair”. But it “isn’t”.

People will tell me that is complete bullshit... 
Court systems and the justice system ALWAYS WORKS, cause it’s perfect.
I got some news they probably don’t really wanna hear... Nah, it isn’t perfect nor does it work all that well. 

I’m hanging onto physical evidence of SCSO facilitating an attempted murder on (5/26/2020)...
...and evidence of them avoiding that over and over.

Not even given a trial. 
I was TOLD that, one would at some point, “exist”...? 
But then, they gave me CONFLICTING INSTRUCTIONS. 

I can actually prove that... 
So, if I meet an actual lawyer like “Lawyer Man 5000”...
...and courtrooms aren’t actually staged at all.

$Book.AddSection(9,"Skit [~] Lawyer Man 5000",@"
When it comes to all of the law men out there in the wild...? 
Well... sometimes you might need help from a guy like Lawyer Man 5000.

If you’ve never heard of Lawyer Man 5000...? 
You’re missing out.

Dude was born to uphold the law WAY better than anyone else... 
Carries around a friggen scale of justice to serve people on BOTH sides of the law...
...never lies to his clients, never tells them that he will call them, and then fail to...
...unlike a lot of other lawyers out there that do that *constantly*...
...if you leave a message on his voicemail...? 

The man will call you back in nearly no time at all.
Because that’s how REAL the man chooses to keep it.

This is the type of dude that makes Johnny Cochran look like a joke.
Whenever he steps into a courtroom...? 
Everybody’s butthole quivers in fear... 
...even the judge.

Dude went to Harvard Law School. 
Since he was one of the most gifted students that ever went there...? 
*chuckles* Heh. He would often make a little game out of how few classes he could attend...
...while still attaining the highest grade possible...
...and kicking the shit out of everybody at poker that whole time.

Me        : Well, way to rip the wind out of my sails man.

Guy       : Yeah, well... 
            I’m not impressed. 
            Can’t be talking about the best lawyer that ever lived, with a name like “Lawyer Man 5000”.

Defendant  : I don’t know. Why do you say that...?

...has a black briefcase that he carries around too, but there’s nothing in it. 

He just opens it to be suspenseful... 
...he never pulls anything out of it, because he memorizes all of his case details.

...SOME of them have heard of this guy before, few of them have seen him in action.

When he defends somebody...? 
He makes a real show out of it. 

Before, you had courtroom attendants and bailiffs practically dozing off, and passing out. 

But- whenever Lawyer Man 5000 somehow enters the courtroom...? 
Now it’s an action-packed, cinematic event.
Everyone suddenly wakes up. 
Now, they’re all on the edge of their seat. 
Because, they know that the sparks are about to fly.

All of a sudden, the doors barge open, and the prosecutor strolls in.

This James Comey lookin’ dude, looks as well dressed as Lawyer Man 5000.
He’s accompanied by a couple of other guys that look like they’re from the FBI.
They all have shades on too.

             This is the trial buddy. 
             Gotta have a good reason to make me want to adjourn it...
LM5K       : I have reason to believe that the defendants attorneys have “dropped the ball” 
             *hand to the side of his mouth* as usual. 
             My client has advised me that the defendant has emailed and phoned the attorneys repeatedly. 
             Has never gotten a return (call/email) regarding the content he submitted. 
             Content that keeps being ignored.
Judge      : Is that so... 
             ...do you have proof of this?
LM5K       : Oh... 
             I’ve got plenty of proof buddy. 
             Kid’s email account has the notice of termination from back in August. 
             Then their office assigned a different attorney to his case without advising the client.
Judge      : Christ almighty... fine. 
             We can adjourn the the trial to... *checks calendar* we’re booked out for quite a while. 
             This case has been on the burner for some time.

Woman #1: It is, isn’t it...?

                 Sometimes I work for free. 
                 Because... I believe in principle. 
                 If I can tell that some client is lying to my face...? 
                 `$5000 bucks chum.

Look. 
A guy named Lawyer Man 5000... doesn’t exist.
But- there’s a guy who does basically the same thing and has an even cooler story.

As far as why I’d need a guy like Lawyer Man 5000 on my side...?
Well, I’ve got a lot more evidence than the stuff I’ve posted. 
But- I have to make an adamant example out of the agency, Saratoga County.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Excerpt [~] Taking the law into one’s own hands",@"
Just like I made an example out of Jeff Truesell, I was willing to provide my own sense of justice. 
Because the kid kept breaking into my home.

Tom Reivik is a kid I went to school with, who was always respected by a number of people.
But, had some honesty issues, couldn’t openly say things to a guy like me if I’d upset him.
He’d have to tell some OTHER person, so that I would get the IMPRESSION that I... kinda almost annoyed him. 
Possibly. 
MAYBE...

That’s how some people think. 
They don’t want to DIRECTLY say stuff to people...

They want YOU to HEAR about it, through some labyrinthian manner, where it bounces off of a thousand surfaces and 
THEN, finally... magically. It eventually got to you. Then, you heard about something someone MAY have heard...

Sounds fuckin’ moronic, right?
Well...
The police will prioritize what someone, such as himself, would say.
Not me.

If some kid broke into Tom Reivik’s home, they would’ve arrested that kid the FIRST time...
...that Tom Reivik called the police.
 
Me though...? 
I called these fucks (4) fucking times, and they did nothing.
So, it’s ok if some <unspecified> named Zontell Gordon murders my father... 
 
It’s ok if Jeff Truesell molested me when I was a kid... 
I’m not a queer, but a lot of the kids at school didn’t give a shit and said it anyway.

It’s ok if MY fuckin’ house is broken into... but Tom...? 
He would’ve had that kid arrested the first time he called.

That’s because SCSO has always had some prejudice toward me.

Only certain people get to have a trial.
Most people never get a trial at all, and even if they do, it is scripted.’
When the court appoints a person a lawyer, it will be some lazy <unspecified> like Sarah Schellinger, 

Maybe they’ll try to tell me that it’s cause I fuckin’ swore... 
...swear words offended them, made them feel uncomfortable...
 
Right, but before I SWITCHED to that tactic, I would occasionally find myself saying stuff...?  
THEN a long period of time went by, where someone had PLENTY OF TIME, to get back to me.

What I’d often find is that, people lie a lot. 
Even them.

Almost like having their fight-or-flight response engaged. 
THAT caused them to start applying something they don’t like to apply. 
Effort. 

Most people in the world don’t really APPLY themselves. 
Judges even do this shit. 
    
Whether I physically assault somebody, or I say something like that...?  
They try to pretend like that was TOTALLY unwarranted... 

Nah, it was definitely fuckin’ warranted alright.
Still, they ALL do it. The doctors, the police, lawyers, they ALL do this.
Some of them are ok, but most of them, they will give me a hard time.
I don’t know why, other than maybe they like the power trip, or something.

Almost like they’re not really afraid of get punched in the face.
Then, being unconscious. I won’t hit a girl. Guys I will.
When they wake up, they will say "What the hell did you do that for...?"
Well, it was cause somebody needed an attitude adjustment.

$Book.AddSection(9,"Skit [~] Ted Cruz (2)",@"
Cruz : I mean, jeez buddy. 
If the police don’t feel like doin’ something, then they really don’t have to...
Me   : You’re right Ted. 
That’s why it’s OK to purchase a firearm, and shoot people in self defense. 
Especially in YOUR state.
Cruz : We do love guns here... 
But, we don’t shoot people for every misunderstanding.
Me   : Ok...? 
Good. 
Never said that. 
Why would you insinuate that at all...?
Cruz : You appear to have a well written dialog where I’m supposedly having conversations with you, 
...but I’ve never accepted bribery money from Exxon Mobil.
Me   : You just lied. 
People that lie, produce inflections in their demeanor and it is audibly produced...
...sometimes more information can be extracted by what is NOT said...
...or, the timing/delivery of what IS said.
Basically, flat out denying that you’ve ever accepted bribery money...
...isn’t how an innocent person would respond to that, just so you understand... 
Sometimes, when I explain to people what I know about psychology...
...people will actually realize that I’m not babbling. 
Having more understanding than them causes them to feel inferior...
...and their only strategy when they’re in over their head, is to try and distract me... 
...or, say "you’re nuts pal". 
But, there’s actually a reason that doesn’t work. 
It’s cause I’m smarter than a lot of people. 
I didn’t always think that, but I do now. 
Because people in society think that their position in social structures boils down to intelligence.
Nah, the most popular person might be a moron (like my old buddy Dwayne Coonradt). 
Or, the coolest kid might steal money from his best friend.
Or, the family member might go around calling their other family member psychotic...
...rather than to have a conversation.
Basically, people prove that they are cowards quite often. 
Cowards will understand what I’m saying, and then nod and smile, cause... 
I just said a bunch of shit that went over their heads.
They didn’t get it. 
Sounded like something a crazy person would say. 
But... I know they just lied. 
Then they may realize I’m onto them and so they start to say things like "That dude’s crazy~!"
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Excerpt [~] That dudes crazy~!",@"

Sometimes people will say that because [they’re fuckin’ stupid*]. 
No better explanation, actually. 

There’s a chance that [I’m not crazy at all*], but [people push me to no end*]. 
So I have to [stand up for myself*] and [take control by force*].

Then I remember that’s how Jeff Truesell acted after I allowed him to stand up...
...after smacking him in the head with a baseball bat.

I’ve talked about it in this material already, but- in (July/August) 2002, I assaulted this person who victimized 
me for many years, and when I tell people the story they actually will tell me "Wow, it sounds unbelievable". 
I know it does, but it is the truth.

So, when I tell people it actually happened, they get confused because they can’t understand how so many people 
would do such a number on me. I understand it, I have to find some clever way to instantiate or communicate to 
other people... 

A dark cloud has followed me my entire god damn life.
The dude literally thought it was cool, to keep breaking into my house. 
And, terrorizing me.

People may not understand, that’s why the baseball bat slammed against his head wasn’t an unwarranted thing.

Not because I just randomly felt like doing that, but because, I literally asked everyone for help... 
Not one fucking person cared.
These kids had some intention to do something really sinister to me.

If Dwayne Coonradt ever went through a situation like that, he probably would’ve sucked that dudes dick...
...and then not gotten beaten up.
Not my style. 

Then, after he was assaulted, I allowed him to get up and run away... 
This kid says "You’re crazy~!" but, it seemed pretty funny to me because that’s how stupid Jeff was.

Kids are gonna call ME crazy, because he kept taunting me every day that went by. 
I almost killed him, luckily I didn’t. 
But there was an entire 13 years of time that went by that caused that event to take place.

Before that point...? 
I actually had a future where I would probably be as successful... as Daniel Pickett. Or, Chad Gregory.
Good for them, I wish them the best on all of their future endeavors, I really do.

It’s not like I went around hurting people.
There was a very specific reason that I did what I did, to that specific individual...
...I did it in self defense... 
...not unlike Kyle Rittenhouse.

However, VERY MUCH UNLIKE KYLE RITTENHOUSE, I didn’t get a very fair trial at all. 

Not gonna ride Kevin Tollisen’s case...
But- the best defense his firm offered wasn’t very great.
I was handed a scripted sentence, for defending myself.

Yeah. 
Jeff tried to take the baseball bat out of my hands, and I wasn’t gonna be caught dead standing there...
...by myself with the baseball bat on the ground and the two of them talking shit to me... 
...leaving 515 symbols on the street in front of my house... 

Jeff had every intention of killing me at some point. 
Maybe he didn’t, but it felt like he wasn’t able to control himself, and I didn’t feel like being a victim.

Whenever Zack skipped school, I had a terrible feeling he skipped school to break in. 
We changed the locks, it did nothing. 
We called the police, it did nothing. 
They came, they never printed or dusted or anything, asked me if he had ever been invited into my house. 

I said "Yes." 
I should have lied to that police officer and said "No." (← What our society teaches people to do)

But- I didn’t. 
That’s what I get, for telling the fucking truth. 
Had I lied like everybody else...? 
Probably would’ve avoided so much pain and misery. 
Regardless, there’s an interesting parallel here.
    
Nobody knows what the 515 symbol means, but it has something to do with marking someone to be killed. 
Nearly identical to the symbol of the sickle that the (2) twins in Breaking Bad. 
Michael Ehrmantraut is extracting the “bug” that he installed at Walter White’s house. 
While he’s in the SHOWER, the twins left this marking outside of Walter White’s house. 
Marking him for death.

Jeff Truesell and Zackary Temme, and Donald Devoe... they did that shit to me.
People can say "That dude’s crazy", right...? But they’re rarely ever accurate... 
Why...?

Cause there might be the chance, that someone was being very honest...
...and someone decided to lie and say those words.

So like, I once dated a girl named Meghan Purtcell. 
Way back when my friend Colin Lane was seeing some girl named Kaylei Williams. 
They dated for a while, Colin constantly told this girl:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Colin  : You better... 
         ...suck my fuckin’ dick, bitch~! (he didn’t say it in a threatening way)
Kaylei : *smiling* Not right here dude. 
         Soon though.
Colin  : Alright, well... 
         *shaking his fist at her* ...you fuckin’ BETTER at some point...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

And she would, gladly. 
She enjoyed being talked to like that.

Never understood it, just be a fuckin’ total, obnoxious, rude, insensitive prick...? 
And, girls like that. 

Kaylei, was good friends with Meghan. 
Meghan, thought I was cute. 
We started hanging out. 
I almost fucked her in my room one night. 

She was talking to my mother, then I got impatient cause she kept talking, and then kicked her out...
...and made a move. Bad timing. 
She was JUST talkin’ to my mom. Didn’t even like try to preheat the oven, pretty dumb. 
Nobody else was with us. 
She was still flirting with me AFTER that, and we played cards and stuff. 
But- something about her seemed off. And, I totally forgot about this girl...

Then, I met a girl named Amber Burdo. 
We dated for quite a while... and she and I fucked a lot. 
When I say a lot... I mean quite a lot, enough to get her pregnant, actually. 

Pretty sure she tried to tell people “no way, uh-uh, never would I ever”, and then she did.
She was dating some dude from Chili’s named Brandon.
Then her ex-boyfriend David got out of jail, and then scooped her up like it was no big deal.
She lied to me about the whole situation, it didn’t change the fact that I already knocked her up.
I didn’t think anything of it and just loaded her up with some jizzlings. Oh well.

Then one night, I go to Trickshot Billiards after working a full 12 hour fuckin’ day at Computer Answers, 
running the place as if I actually owned the fuckin place, because I had more talent that Dwayne or the 
owner... and I crushed it that day, so that Tim could get his fuckin’ rent money. Cool.

Then, this girl Cayla told me Amber was in the hospital. 
Meghan was the bartender... 
Cayla realized that I was the dude that Amber was seeing a lot. 
Her and Amber had a thing too. 
Cayla was fucking MAD jealous that I had a dick, and Amber liked hanging out with my kids. 
Cause Cayla, was a <unspecified> like that... 
So, in HER mind, Amber wasn’t ALLOWED to hang out with 
1) me
2) my kids
3) try to fill the void that their mother wasn’t there to fill... 
So, fuck you Cayla.

She threatened to tell Brandon such and such, and I slowly felt like this girl was a fuckin’ problem. 
Amber and I would hang out. 
For a number of reasons. 
One of those reasons, was to fuck a lot. 

Anyway, Cayla found out THAT NIGHT, that I was that guy with the kids. 
Running a business, being a single dad...? 
Cayla, she didn’t really give a shit about any of that. Nah, I’m a dude, I have a dick, and in her eyes...? 
I’m a fuckin’ douchebag-and-a-half multiplied by 10 (or 20).
So... no winning scenario here.

Cayla, was a lesbian. Doing the same thing that the gay kid who does the “fuck off phenomenon”. 
The ol’ c-block maneuver, whichever way you wanna say it... Cayla was that.
She wanted to have Amber all to herself... but Amber is a girl who likes penis. 
Cayla probably doesn’t... but I don’t know.

Then she said "I’m gonna tell Brandon fuckin’ yay da"... 
Anyway, Meghan saw that Cayla and I were arguing. Meghan, NOR Cayla, NOR myself, had ANY idea that I was 
the reason that Amber was in the hospital. They didn’t care about anything I had to say. They immediately 
ejected me from the bar, not one person at the bar understood... she was in the fuckin’ hospital because of ME.

Cause I totally loaded her up with a solid stream of jizzlings, alright. 
Fucked her and gotten her pregnant. 

Now, people said "You’re crazy~!" and then I left the situation at that. 
Basically I said “Fine... Fuck you guys, then... I’m outta here.”
They were like “Fine. See ya.” 
Then I was like “I’m leaving. So... Bye.”
They were like “Good...”
Then I said “You guys are ridiculous... Bye again.”

I had no idea that Amber was in the hospital because of me. 
Not because I hurt her, but because I... check it out. 
I jizzed in her a few times. 

Cayla can’t jizz into another girl. 
Neither can Meghan. 
You have to be an actual MALE, with a PENIS, that doesn’t do what Ted Cruz does... 
...where HE gets MONEY to allow himself to be blasted in the butt by Exxon Mobil... 
...once you pass ALL the requirements of being a guy, with a dick, willing to fuck some girl...? 
THEN, you might be able to get that girl knocked up. 
Whether its by accident or intentionally....? 
Nature doesn’t care. 

Amber, is hot. Meghan was ALSO hot. Believe it or not Cayla wasn’t bad looking either, somewhat hot too. 
While it is true, that Meghan might score like a 9 or 10 on the hotness scale, fact of the matter is...
I never once thought that she was as intelligent as Amber. 
Amber is probably a WAY better bartender too... 
She would tell me about how she kicked everybody’s ass at selling margaritas, and clean house at this contest.

So, the comparison, is hard to make. 
Not even fuckin’ close. 
Amber, was a really smart girl, believe it or not... and that’s what I liked a lot about her. 

That’s a pretty personal story, but I figured I’d bring that up because ALL of those people seemed to think 
I was outside of my fuckin’ mind, and would say “He’s crazy~!”, right? But- nah. I’m not. 

Now, when people say shit like me telling people the truth, for a specific reason, the popular cool 
people who aren’t anywhere near as intelligent, or armed with knowledge...? 

I actually outsmart everybody by telling the truth. 
It’s pretty easy to not have to keep track of what lies someone told someone else...
...and what story was exchanged, or swapped around, or stated as almost accurate, but bent slightly...

Nah, cause when you tell people the truth...? 
You don’t even have to put ANY fuckin’ thought into: 
“Oh, I don’t wanna piss THAT person off, or that person either...”

Oh well. Grow a fuckin’ nutsack. 
If you insult some people, they’re probably lame anyway. 
Nobody just does nothing to deserve being insulted... 
Plenty of people do shit worthy of being INSULTED, and yet they continue to be RESPECTED.
Why...? Because some people just keep their fuckin’ mouths shut instead of telling them the truth.

If you have nothing nice to say, don’t say anything at all. (← This fuckin’ expression is quite problematic) 

That’s why people wind up getting shot to death by ACTUAL CRAZY PEOPLE.
Cause a bunch of people probably noticed the BIG RED FLAGS... 
But... they had nothing nice to say. 
So, they didn’t say anything at all. (← see why it’s problematic...?)

America. People that LIE, they don’t actually give a shit about whether someone finds out... 
But, sometimes lying protects someone from getting hurt. Sometimes, people judge each other based on how 
they appear. Me, having been in hundreds of fist fights with people, am nowhere near as attractive as 
Meghan. But, does that give her the right to lie to people...? In her eyes, it most absolutely does.

Yeah, attractive people are the reason why lies get told and nobody gives a shit if they’re lied to. 
OH WAIT, yeah, some people DO care if they’re lied to. 
It can actually result in people spending a SHITLOAD OF MONEY, and GETTING MARRIED, and then oh wait. 
Then, you and I stop “loving” each other, and now we’re getting’ DIVORCED... 
...it’s a lot of hogwash and bullshit. 
I’m not saying that it’s TOTAL bullshit, cause it isn’t.

But- basically everybody’s manipulated to spend money SOMEHOW. 
Most people just sit around like they’re going fishing. 
If they LIE, they lie. 
Oh well, fuck you. 
They can lie if they feel like it, because they’re attractive, and so what. 
I hope people understand EXACTLY what I’m saying with that rhetoric, it’s not really ok to lie.

Lying to people, about me, is what caused a rift between Tim Berlin, and myself. 
He never admitted that...? 
But it’s because people feel like they can lie to me or just say whatever.

But that’s mainly because people who do that haven’t been informed, that I might break their legs at some point. 
Not if it’s some bitch... I won’t do that at all. 
But if it’s a dude, all bets are on.

Once they know this...? THAT’S why they say that... 
It’s not cause I’m actually crazy. 
It’s because someone has a “reputation” to “protect”. 
People “protect” their “reputation” by LYING. 

People who tell the truth all the time don’t refer to it as protecting their reputation.
That’s why they’re totally different terms. 
Reputation management is when you don’t mind doing exactly what Ted Cruz does.
Or, like Mark Zuckerberg does, where he’ll steal people’s (ideas/intellectual property)...
...and even have people killed.
I’m certain that he does this.

As for Tim Cruz, Getting a huge dick shoved in his asshole for a cool `$500M.
I really am gonna state this here to put Tim Berlin in the hot seat...
I am curious if Tim Berlin would do that too. Take a hot flaming pecker in his asshole, for `$500M.
Just like Ted god damn Cruz.
I really have no fuckin’ clue to be honest. I don’t think Tim Berlin would do that. 
However, Dwayne Coonradt and Pavel Zaichenko sure as fuck would. In a god damn heartbeat.

People will say the words "He’s crazy~!" because: 
    
1) I’m smarter than they are
2) I can tell when people lie to me
3) I’m willing to break someones legs, if necessary
    
Normal people don’t know how to do that. Because, most people give other people the benefit of a doubt. 
Most things stay low key and never get national attention because Fox News is fuckin’ stupid, and slow.

The others may get SOME details, but they won’t do anything to upset Exxon Mobil. Nope. 
Basically they don’t want to end up like James Comey, trying to do the right thing, but then having someone 
jam a fuckin’ huge dildo up their asshole unwillingly.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Skit [~] Ted Cruz (3)",@"
    Me    : People will say “he’s crazy” when they know I’m right.
            Probably because they *really* enjoy a hot, flaming pecker in the asshole...
            At least you though Ted... 
            I’m pretty sure you like that idea a lot. 
            Don’t ya?
    Cruz  : You keep alluding to ME somehow enjoying when stuff is shoved in my ass...
    Me    : Maybe you don’t actually ENJOY it... 
            ...maybe you just TOLERATE it. 
            But, it seems accurate either way, that’s why I say it...
    Cruz  : Says you.
    Me:     Maybe you don’t, Ted.
    Cruz:   I don’t.
    Me:     Says you.
    Cruz:   Someone would’ve arrested me by now if I was accepting bribery money from Exxon Mobil.	(← FALLACY ALERT)
    Me:     The way that the law is WRITTEN, yeah... 
            ...you would have been if anyone with the proper badge knew how to read.
            The problem is, I know that most of them are morons. 
            The few that aren’t, don’t like pissing off their coworkers.
            But, a lot of people say this whole "something would’ve happened by now if such and such"
            So like, if you WERE gay...
            ….you probably would’ve gotten smacked in the face with a dick by now, right...?
            But, that question doesn’t consider... 
            ...if you’re NOT gay, are you STILL being smacked in the face with a dick at all...? 
            Cause what if you’re a straight guy, who just so happens to be smacked in the face by a dick?
            These questions SOUND SILLY, but they are actually PHILOSOPHY. 
            Basically, LOGIC BUILDING.
            So, if a GIRL has SEX with a GUY and gets PUMPED full of JIZZLINGS... she MIGHT get pregnant.
            Doesn’t necessarily mean that she will.
            Typically, those assertions make sense, unless there’s a FACT hiding in plain sight.
            Sometimes a person will say all of these things you’ve been saying in this conversation...
            ...because they’re attempting to pull a fast one.
            But- some people really are that stupid...
            ...where they’ll try to pull a fast one on someone a lot more intelligent than they are.
            It has the opposite effect actually. 
            It just comes off looking like someone has some jizz-on-the-chin.
            Now, Trooper Border has to move his hand to check real quick...
            "No I don’t..."
            Well, why’d you move your hand?
            Oh. 
            It’s cause that’s how to manipulate people.
            I just somehow have a way of ripping through all your responses...
            ...and still having suspicion toward you, for accepting bribery money from Exxon Mobil.
            Look on the bright side... 
            I never once said you had a smidge of jizz-on-the-chin.
    Cruz:   You know, if I just sit here, and don’t say a word... 
            ...I’ll never get in trouble for being bribed.
    Me:     You’re probably right. 
            Exxon Mobil didn’t get in trouble for demolishing WTC 7 on September 11, 2001, did they?
    Cruz:   Listen buddy, that’s not what happened, Shayam Sundar and NIST-
    Me:     ...had a dick in their mouth too. 
            Don’t worry, I’ve put a lot more thought into this, than anyone you have ever met. 
            So, shut the fuck up.
            Shayam Sundar was tasked with covering up the collapse of the Twin towers and WTC 7. 
            Why...? 
            Cause a former president probably committed treason on 9/11/2001.
            The truth is Ted, I’m a lot smarter than most people.
            People think intelligence is based on who you know, or how rich you are.
    Cruz:   It is. 
            Obviously.
    Me:     Nah, idiots say that. 
            It isn’t, believe it or not. 
            However, those things are not resultant to being intelligent. 
            They’re resultant to being social.
            And, perhaps being respectful and polite.
            Not being a condescending dickhead expecting to be respected, when they’ve done nothing to earn it.
            So, I know bullshit when I hear it.
            Everything out of your mouth so far, has been bullshit, assuming I don’t know what the fuck is going on.
    Cruz:   If someone thought that I was doing something I shouldn’t have been doing...
    Me:     Most people will assume that it would’ve been handled by now. 
            So that means they will think it’s impossible... OR highly unlikely...
            Most people will confuse the terms:
            - impossible (adjective: not able to occur, exist, or be done)
            - unlikely   (adjective: not likely to be true or to happen)
            Now, is it IMPOSSIBLE that you’re being bribed by Exxon Mobil AND having a dick shoved up your ass?
    Cruz:   It’s UNLIKELY that I would be doing that and not have gotten in trouble for it by now.
    Me:     Correct. 
            That is... a true statement.
            However, UNLIKELY just means not likely. 
            Still could be very likely after all, ESPECIALLY when money is involved.

    Cruz:   Whatever dude. 
            I don’t have to answer to you, I’ve got shit to do. 
            I’m too important.
    Me:     Fallacies, dicks in the mouth, and falsehoods... 
            ...all sounds the same to me, bud.
            I mean, at least you’re not being forced to suck RUPERT MURDOCKs dick like Sean Hannity.
            In RUPERT MURDOCK’s case, or Exxon Mobil’s case...
            ...they’ve got enough money to bribe every single police officer that would NORMALLY arrest you...
            ...as well as Christopher Wray the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
            With enough of that bribery happening...
            ...I could tell them to ignore those pesky little annoying opinions Michael C. Cook has...
            ...OR EVEN, censor the dog shit out of him... 
            ...limit his right to free speech... 
            ...since his opinion goes against my stack of cash and how important I am...
            ...then, make it appear as if the CIA isn’t watching - when they’re watchin’. 
            For sure.

            A criminal activity like bribery being committed by Ted Cruz (senator from Texas),
            ...won’t be as “important” to enforce...
            Because, everybody gets bribed. 
            Right...?

            Then somebody can use a program like Pegasus/Phantom, and kill citizens that get too fucking nosy.
            Not only do I know that’s exactly what’s happening, but... 
            It costs a lot less money to guys like Ruperty Murdock, or Exxon Mobil... 
            ...than taping together a brick of money, and throwin’ it at this guy...
            ...and knockin’ him the fuck out with that heavy ass brick of cash.

            TUCKER CARLSON is a fuckin’ lyin sack of shit who probably has a 4-inch pecker...
            If he said he’s not gay...? I’d believe him... 
            …but the girls probably tell him "Aw, how cute" when they see how small his dick is.
            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Bob Lutz is the former director of General Motors...
            ...who spent 50 years there and just so happened to shit his pants every day...
            If he said he’s not gay, I’d believe him... 
            ...even though he- *pauses* I don’t know how a man shits his pants every day... but, whatever.
            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Sean Hannity is also a lying sack of shit who might have an 8 inch pecker...
            If he said he’s not gay, I would not believe him at all... 
            ...cause the girls he probably tries to have sex with...
            ...they may notice that he’s definitely no small-dicked bastard, 
            ...but it doesn’t get hard when they play with it – that means, pretty gay, or his hearts not workin’ right.
            So then he’s gotta have sex with guys like RUPERT MURDOCK, since that makes his dick hard probably.
            But, RUPERT MURDOCK probably doesn’t like the idea of doing *anything* gay...
            except making Sean Hannity suck his dick sometimes, just for the power trip...
            ...cause he’s probably straight and fucks lots of women.
            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Look Ted, the point is, I know you’re not gay at all. 
            You just love cash, and don’t mind allowing your asshole to get pounded out.
            That’s... the OPPOSITE of having integrity.
            Even William Gates himself, probably thinks "My fuckin’ god... That is... Wow. I’m fuckin’ speechless Ted."
            But then he’ll say "Well.. it’s a free country after all. What can anybody do?"
            ...even though that dude can basically do more than 99% of the people on the planet.
            That dude can’t stop ya, Ted.
            Neither can the police. 
            Neither can Elon Musk.
            Or Mark Zuckerberg.
            All things considered, pretty sure Mark Zuckerberg would never be caught dead doin’ what you do.
            Nor these other guys.
            I mean, Jeff Bezos probably briefly considers it every once in a while, but I don’t know. 
            Maybe he doesn’t.
    Cruz:   I don’t really know what to say...
    Me:     Well, climate change is real. 
            You could tell Sean Hannity that he should stop saying that it isn’t.
            Otherwise, who the fuck are ya Ted...?
    Cruz:   *pauses*
    Me:     Oh, I’ll tell ya.
            You’ll be the guy who wasn’t actually gay, but... 
            ...allowed himself to be clobbered by a penis, repeatedly...
            Once a man who isn’t gay, goes and gets himself clobbered by ONE penis...?
            ...that man is bound to get himself clobbered by many, many more.
            Do you know who does that, Ted...?
    Cruz:   *eyebrows up* ...girls?
    Me:     *nodding* That’s right, Ted. And, gay guys.
            You won’t even fall into either of those categories, either.
            It’ll be WEIRD. 
            People will shake their heads and say "Wow, Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, isn’t even gay...
            ...but has sex with guys...? That’s... disgraceful."
            Then what, Ted? *shakes head*
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(9,"Hidden Government",@"
Guys like Ted Cruz (senator from Texas), Sean Hannity, TUCKER CARLSON...? 
They each get a cool stack of cash from this dude, RUPERT MURDOCK and/or Exxon Mobil.
Then they call this daily orgy on television, Fox News.

This Murdock fella, isn’t gay at all.
He still likes the idea of having a power trip, and forces Sean Hannity to blow him all the time.
If you showed people a video of Sean Hannity, getting on his hands and knees...
...with his head bobbing up and down in Murdock’s lap, how do you think that would look?

Some people will probably say "You have some nerve to say all of that~!" 
Nah, not really, each of these men have been paid hundreds of millions of dollars to say: 
“(I’m a queer and) Climate change doesn’t exist.”
It’s not the only thing they get paid millions of dollars to DO though.

Carlson is literally paid to talk shit to people...
...without alerting anybody that he does that every time he’s on TV.

Carlson told Rupe Murdock that he’s not a cocksucker, and to never ask him again to blow him.
Hannity didn’t put up much of a fight. Now it’s a regular thing they do.

Consider this... Think about some girl sucking some dudes dick.
That is literally what Hannity does to RUPERT MURDOCK, basically every day.
Even if people caught them doing this shit...? 
They’re not gonna care.

The problem is, people are gonna get upset with me for being honest with everybody. 
These guys aren’t very straightforward or honest at all. 
I can prove it, right now actually.
Whenever Hannity doesn’t have Murdock’s dick in his mouth, he will say something like:
__________________________________________
| Hannity: Climate change doesn’t exist. |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
But, here’s a “picture” of Murdock’s dick in Hannity’s mouth...

Pretty sure I already said this earlier in this document, but check out this “picture”.

Picture: Last year, was the hottest year on record, and the last 8 out of 10 years, 
were ALSO the hottest years on record. 

A description of the WEATHER over the last year... 
1) unprecedented wildfires, 
2) unprecedented hurricane patterns, 
3) unprecedented tornadoes patterns
4) unprecedented drought seasons, 
5) (INDIRECTLY caused by weather) unprecedented inflation, etc. need I go on...? 

These are the realities of Hannity having Murdock’s dick in his mouth all the time... and climate change. 
Ted Cruz said for so many years, that all of that shit was a myth, but he was getting drilled between the 
ass cheeks by Exxon Mobil after he said that. TUCKER CARLSON said some of that stuff too.

That’s why the Fox News Network, should be called the "Not News Network".
__________________________________________________________________________________
| Used to be News...? Now we’re not news. Not News. Part of the Not News Network |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The reason why they say all of it is a myth, is because:

1) they’re ACTUALLY fuckin’ morons
2) the police that COULD be arresting SOMEBODY for SOMETHING...? 

Some of ‘em are fuckin’ morons too.

“News anchors” that are actually actors... 
They are RICH morons, because RUPERT MURDOCK’s is a rich bastard. 
The thing is, they could just admit that climate change is DEFINITELY real... 
...then maybe these rich dudes could stop lying to themselves and everybody else.

Carlson, lies about how small his dick is.
Hannity, probably has a dick twice the size as Carlson, but wishes it could get hard near a girl.
...only one that will gladly suck on Murdock’s dick every day.
...also has kids, which is fuckin’ weird for a cocksucker like him.
Cruz, isn’t even gay, and cries when he gets blasted in the butthole by Exxon Mobil...
...always offers Exxon Mobil some KY jelly, but they never use it.

I’ll stop telling everyone these things at some point. It won’t change the reality though.

I doubt they’ll admit it. 
Anyway, look... the results are in, Fox News isn’t news.
You won’t hear about any of these things I just rattled off above, because, they push
propaganda, not news. That’s why it SHOULD be called, the Not News Network. NNN for short.

The idea here, is that changing the name would allow any regular person, to realize that...
Fox News finally came clean. They, thought that the things they were reporting, were newsworthy...
But then they had to ALTER things about the story, whereby FALSIFYING their credibility... 

So, if they change the name to Not News Network, then people will be able to ask themselves...
"Hey, is this for fuckin’ real right now...?" The answer is “No.” 
Everything they report isn’t news. Nor is it credible. 
The only reason why people actually find these dudes credible, is because nobody has shown the world
what Sean Hannity looks like having his head in RUPERT MURDOCK’s lap, bobbing up and down. 

Probably sounds gay, doesn’t it?  
That’s cause it is.
Very.
No trickery here at all, Hannity spends an excessive amount of time gagging on Murdock’s dick.
Never ever says to Murdock, "Man, I really need to take a break dude, my fuckin’ jaw hurts..."
Why...? Dude has a jaw of steel, from what I imagine.
If a girl sucks my dick for hours at a time... they’ll say that too.

The problem is, guys like TUCKER CARLSON get a lot of ratings because people actually feel bad for this dude.
Tucker doesn’t know what it’s like for a girl to say “my jaw hurts, dude.”
So, these things are the real reasons why people watch him. 
TUCKER CARLSON has the face of a boy who is ALWAYS on the verge of tears...
...crying, basically.
People empathize with how he sounds, because he’s like an excited little kid, but... 
...might be moments away from bawling his eyes out.
So, people feel bad and they keep watching because they want to know if he’s about to cry.

Sure, he probably does sound interesting to somebody that doesn’t want to put any thought into anything.
That’s why his ratings are so high.
Some people say to themselves "I really, don’t fuckin’ wanna think about nothin’..."
So then they put it on Fox News.
Perfect choice for propaganda, not news.

Then, Tucker will literally do all of their thinking FOR them... since he’s like President VLADIMIR PUTIN.
That means they, don’t even have an opinion, they’re just repeating what that dude said.

That’s why every time he opens his mouth, HE doesn’t even remember what the hell he said. 
Dude somehow became a millionaire... it’s not because he says stuff. 
It’s the way he looks, and how his voice sounds, that causes such good ratings.
Once people actually pay attention to what he fuckin’ says...?
...they realize pretty quickly that he’s a fuckin’ moron.

Some people actually enjoy watching him because of how moronic he sounds.
RUPERT MURDOCK is one of those people.
It’s not because Carlson is a good public speaker...
That’s laughable.
People should consider, how does this man constantly know what to say...?
Is it magic...?
Does he research any of this...?
Does the man write stuff down...?

Nah, fuckface.
This dude does none of those things at all.
Wanna know what he does...?

He has the camera crew show him pictures in a coloring book, and they flip the pages.    
It’s a real special coloring book that has shapes and stuff that Tucker understands...
...that’s because he can’t actually read.
They made it real simple for him.
You would think he was reading a teleprompter or something, right...?

No way bro.
This dude can’t actually read, lol.
I mean, he will probably tell people that he definitely does, but he just lied.

If people find this dude trustworthy, it’s only because they feel sorry for him.
Dude basically looks like he got lost at a museum and can’t find his mom.

RUPERT MURDOCK picked up on this, and he keeps messing with this dude...

You know, like (1) TUCKER CARLSON, and (2) Sean Hannity... 
these (2) morons are paid over `$100M a year, intentionally saying moronic shit every time they’re on the air. 
No exceptions.
Every fuckin’ time they’re on TV...? 
They are working very hard to cause people to think that they’re watchin’ the fuckin’ news.
It’s not news anyone ever sees on Fox News.
It’s propaganda, actually.

Fox Commercials, oil industry, cars, pharmaceuticals that might kill you later, etc.

It’s cause it’s a fuckin’ propaganda machine. When people go to work and participate in the economy, they 
very rarely realize that they’re just doing the bidding of somebody that has the entire economy under control, 
as in, they manipulate people... by using a large negative number of `$30T. There are plenty of them that
don’t have a MALICIOUS AGENDA...? But- they still have to do some questionable shit sometimes too.

Once people realize that people in control of the country don’t actually have any money...
...they should think to themselves "How is that possible?"

Best analogy I can make...
If one kid lets another kid borrow a toy, and says they have to pay up for each day they have it, 
and AGREES to do that...? Then, that one kid will be happy. However, the kid that’s renting the toy 
out might just take the fuckin’ toy BACK when that kid isn’t looking. 

Rather than to give the other kid an opportunity to PAY for the toy...? 
Nah, fuck you, dude... Someone’s gonna make a HUGE stick about you losing his/her favorite toy.
Now, you still gotta pay for that toy you lost.

Apply the same exact concept to the national debt.

People that don’t understand THAT IS HOW THEY DO IT...
...they get this sense of entitlement, because they may or may not make more than one another, or maybe 
one person works more than another, or maybe someone on public assistance uses their food stamps to buy 
drugs... the truth is, unless you happen to make your way well above millions of dollars... everybody’s 
basically a slave working on the plantation, picking cotton. 

Instead of being born in Africa and getting shipped off to America, you’re born here and it’s... 
whatever man. Same concept.

Climate change...? Very real, killing many, many people (and plants, animals, wildlife). 
But, it’s NOT illegal for Hannity to say that it’s not, and therefore, something that SHOULD be illegal, 
isn’t. Nazi Germany.

Saving money...? Doesn’t work when inflation is moving too quickly... Oh well.
Used to be able to save money... now everyone is supposedly losing money.
Nah. Not everybody.

What EXACTLY is the difference between NEWS and PROPAGANDA...?
"@)

$Book.AddSection(10,"Overview",@"
NEWS, is when actual talented people in an actual news industry... 
...they’ve REPORTED a story without altering the FACTS...
...or forcing details to fit a certain AGENDA...
...or cram their OPINION or RHETORIC down people’s throats.

PROPAGANDA, is when actual talented people in a SOMEWHAT newsy industry...
...they DISTORT a story and then alter the FACTS...
...which forces details to fit a certain AGENDA...
...or cram their OPINION or RHETORIC down people’s throats.

Just like if some girl is blowing me, and I shove her head down, so far...? If those are FACTS, that’s NEWS.

But, if I feel like shoving her head DOWNWARD... 
...the AGENDA is that it’ll fuckin’ feel really good...
...for her, and myself...
...but with a cost where I’ve DISTORTED the story, and altered the FACTS that were originally REPORTED...
...by shoving something down her throat.
    
Exactly like what Fox News actually is, and what Murdock does to Hannity.

When an organization starts to DISTORT the facts, and FORCE details to FIT AN AGENDA, 
That isn’t NEWS.... That’s called "PROPOGANDA/a dildo in someone’s asshole".

This whole piece, is me ‘altering some facts around’, so it’s gonna feel like propaganda too.
Cause, while there are plenty of FACTS and STORIES being thrown in, I can stand to say that 
this falls into a category called propaganda. BUT- I’m not pushing this like it’s NEWS.

...it stands to reason that I’m not oblivious to the notion that this will feel rather chauvinistic.

Some people don’t know what propaganda is... 
Fox News, is a propaganda machine. 
It’s not a news organization. 
That’s why they should change their name, to Not News Network. 

Fox News

When you want the most up to date information possible, on news...? 
Put it on anything that isn’t Fox News.
And take a closer look at how the people reporting ACTUAL news, SOUND and CONVEY themselves.
Now go back and watch a few minutes of Fox News. 

If you don’t see the issue, I’ll explain it. 
Fox News is a counterfeit "news" organization. They USED to report news, sometimes a little bit of it slips by.
Now they just take every story they can, and they alter it to fit their agenda. 
What I mean is, if some serial killer killed a bunch of people in Buffalo, and Fox News really
wants to do what they call, "reporting news"...?

Then some moron could say, 
Carlson: Look, if we’re all honest with ourselves... Buffalo is basically the same thing as Chicago, right?

Uh, no moron. Totally different place...
567 miles apart, but my god this dude will say somethin’ like that.
Some terms are INTERCHANGABLE, but many terms are NOT.
Even *I* may even occasionally use the wrong word, but... 
...I’m not gonna say Buffalo is basically the same thing as Chicago.

Pretty sure that a lot of people will agree with me, he... might say something like that at some point. 
Or already has.

The reason why it sounds so compelling when he says shit like that, is because of the WAY he says the words.
And how stupid he looks when he says those words...
Never once have I watched this dude and enjoyed watching.
If I happened to be watching and he said that a bunch of people did something somewhere...? 
Cool, fuckface. Glad you could give me an update.

But once they start to suggest the way they want YOU to feel, or FRAME how YOU should THINK something SOUNDS...
...or how something SHOULD be considered... it stops being news. 
Now it’s opinion piece, call it the fuckin’ Not News Network instead of calling yourself a news network.

Trailer : Triple N, comin’ at ya... with a Not News update.
          A non-newsworthy update from the Not News Network.
          Why...? 
          Cause we’re Not News. 
          That’s... what we’re ALL about.
          Reporting nothing but shit that's not real news, all the time.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Other news networks have opinion shows, it’s not atypical. 
Brianna Keilar on CNN, good. Very FACT BASED.

Like Ari Melber sounds more educated than Carlson on his best day, also very FACT BASED.
Seems to have no issue telling people "here is what an idiot/moron sounds like, folks..."

He doesn’t say the words “idiot”, or “moron”, because actual news organizations can’t vocalize those
words. Maybe some of them get away with it here and there, but it’s still rare to hear.
You won’t catch Ari Melber saying those words on TV.

Nah, that’s just crossing the line somehow...
Not allowed to say those words, even if it IS true and would be NEWS to say those words...
Ari Melber’s got integrity. He will... wait till he’s off camera and probably give me a fist bump.

I sure as hell can say those words.
If we’re really all honest with ourselves, how is some dude like Ari Melber going to communicate with 
anybody, WHILE being on screen...
...that Sean Hannity sounds like a moron too...?

He might even say “He’s not as bad as Carlson...”
And I might agree. To some extent.

But, he is actually WORSE sometimes, because... when Hannity says that climate change isn’t real...?
He’s basically telling Leonardo Dicaprio what a fuckin’ douchebag he is, or that...
...idk, Sean Hannity is telling Leo Dicaprio that he sucked ass in EVERY movie he was ever in.

And that’s some straight-up, fire-lipped, pecker-roasting, bullshit. 
He’s outstanding in basically every movie he’s ever in. I would even say, on Tom Cruise’s level. 
Without a doubt. 
He’s never in a movie that manages to blow nutsack, let’s put it that way.

| Titanic          |  89 | Plays a dude named Jack, kicks dudes ass at a game of cards, just in time   |
|__________________|_____| to get on a ship that’ll only set sail once. Brings her to the dance hall   |
| to drink, dance, and party like Irishmen. They bounce, get chased by some fuckface, they hide in an  | 
| old school car... and when it gets quiet...? He bangs the snot out of this mad hot red-headed rich   | 
| girl. She was SUPPOSED to marry this other stuck-up fuckfaced clown (Zane), but then bolts.          |
|                                                                                                      |
| Then, Jack paints this painting of her with the Heart of the Ocean, and then they get caught...      |
| Fuckface says “Oh yeh? Well... I don’t think so, bro... She’s mine.”                                 |
| Then, Jack gets himself handcuffed, the butler-like dude says "Peace out, boy scout," and leaves.    |
| Then Rose actually manages to find him and kick him loose.                                           |
| Then, the ship slowly sinks, the orchestra plays some music, and then Jack freezes to death and she  |
| gets very sad. The movie ends with Bill Paxton being the ship commander, and the story flips back    |
| and forth from Rose’s past, to the present. Feels like it all happens within a day.                  |
|                                                                                                      |
| She throws the jewel that Paxton’s character was lookin’ for back into the ocean. “Ooops. My bad.”   |
|======================================================================================================|
| The Departed     |  85 | Plays a guy that has to fit in with the mafia sorta about Whitey Bulger, a  |
|__________________|_____| fuckin’ notorious gangster from Boston. Whitey Bulger was an informant for  |
| the FBI but even still, fucked everybody up while being an informant, and didn’t pull any punches.   | 
|                                                                                                      |
| The movie is pretty twisted, it feels a lot like a real life version of the Sopranos.                |
| But it is actually still very good while also being suspenseful.                                     |
| You’ll need some popcorn, but- prepare to see his character die as well as Matt Damon’s character... |
| Sorta pisses the viewer off too.                                                                     |
|======================================================================================================|
| Wolf of Wall St. | 100 | Probably one of his greatest performances. He begins life as a stock broker |
|__________________|_____| on Wall St., but the company he works at lets him go. He hits rock bottom   |
| but decides to find a way to claw himself back to the top, with some no nonsense “Here, listen to    |
| how I will sell some penny stocks”, and then wrote a script for the other dudes to follow along.     |
|                                                                                                      |
| Jonah Hill is a pretty good supporting actor in this movie, and brings his charm to the film with    |
| full strength. They make the company a shitload of money, and then they decide to go big or go home. |
|                                                                                                      |
| They take a lot of Queludes (older sedatives with a side effect) and other drugs like cocaine.       |
| They fuck a lot of bitches, they also share some of em on the company trading floor.                 |
| They all kick ass, take names, they send stuff to offshore accounts, and then some FBI man comes     | 
| along and that’s when it all falls apart...                                                          |
|                                                                                                      |
| Jordan Belfort is the guys real name. Margot Robbie was the (queen of Dutchess/mad hot wife).        |
| If you don't (watch/like) this movie, then you're probably a fuckin' real lame son of a bitch.       |
|======================================================================================================|
| Inception        | 100 | This fuckin’ movie, is pretty fucking awesome. You’re talking about dreams  |
|__________________|_____| layered within dreams and having story lines that sew each parallel nested  |
| dream to the outside world... time slows down a hell of a lot, and by the time the movie is over...? |
| ...you REALLY feel like there SHOULD be a SEQUEL... but, hasn’t been made yet.                       |
|                                                                                                      |
| Feels like Oceans 11 meets … IDK, Sliders or Quantum Leap, but also, this movie doesn’t really pull  |
| any punches. Nah. Leo’s character really fucks with the rich dude’s son to get the secret out, and   |
| you know what... his wife Mal in this movie, is also pretty hot too, and multiple actors in this     |
| movie are ALSO in the Dark Knight/Batman movies...                                                   |

| Before the Flood | 100 | This ACTOR has earned himself some RESPECT. Not saying it cause all the     |
|__________________|_____| girls thought that “OoOoOh Hes mad cute~!” This dude is actually TALENTED,  |
| and you can really hear how he thinks in real life, in this documentary.                             |
|                                                                                                      |
| Most actors probably would’ve shit their pants to try and do this documentary. (even M. Zuckerberg)  |
| He sounded rather humbled by the opportunity, wasn’t overconfident about it, but also, it’s a pretty |
| compelling, critical piece of the puzzle that I think people will look back on and think to themsel- | 
| ves, “Wow, that’s how bad it was THEN huh?”                                                          |
|                                                                                                      |
| Yeah, that’s actually how bad it was THEN, and it hasn’t slowed down at all. Nah.                    |
| The biggest, most dramatic impact that movie really had on me, was when they drag the rope apart in  | 
| Iceland, and it’s like 30 fuckin’ feet of rope worth of ice that ALL melted. Wow. Amazing.           |
|                                                                                                      |
| That part alone goes to show you how much of a useless cocksucker Sean Hannity IS and HAS BEEN, but  |
| the truth is the entire movie does that too... also applies to Ted Cruz.                             |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Ari Melber isn’t gonna comment on anything I just said, other than MAYBE, saying that Before the Flood was a 
good documentary about climate change, and that Leonardo Dicaprio did a decent job. 

But- even if Ari Melber said that, AND Leo Dicaprio called Hannity a cocksucker too...? 
Things will still be difficult to change. 

The reason why, is cause what the hell man? Murdock, has the industry, by the balls... and doesn’t care.
He’s gettin’ paid one way or the other... 
So is Ted Cruz, and everybody else at the boardroom meeting of doom at Exxon Mobil.

That’s why it helps to use colorful metaphors or analogies that make perfect sense... shouldn’t be illegal to 
call someone a cocksucker when they act like one. Yeah, maybe Ted Cruz isn’t exactly a cocksucker, but he does 
roll over and let big oil drill him between the ass cheeks for a few hundred million. Why...? Idk. Ask him.

As far as Melber’s concerned, it’s not like he really has to look too hard for the newest addition to the Carlson’s
moronic wheel of power. At any given moment, it’s like the Price is Right, you spin this thing, it stops on a number, 
and then (surprise, surprise) THAT number, is another exciting entry of Carlson acting like a fuckin’ moron AGAIN.

Nobody ever sees it coming either... It's almost like this dude has ninja skills when it comes to showing off what a
fuckin top-notch moron he truly is. I'm amazed at how long running his show is... It's flat out, more successful than
Bill O'Reilly's show ever was, hands down. But- that COULD be because Carlson doesn't know how to intimidate people. 

There’s just no way these people can actually “get ahead” of how many times he will make a complete fuckin’ fool of 
himself, and that’s why he is paid so well, and why his ratings are as high as they are. 

Whether it’s Oliver, or Melber/anybody else on NBC, or CBS, CNN, or ABC... 
Oliver can call Carlson a cocksucker if he wants to, but he doesn’t. He should. Melber and everyone else I 
just mentioned, they are NOT free to call Hannity a cocksucker on broadcast television, not without causing 
the network to receive a nasty fine, and probably losing their job.

Believe it or not, Jon Oliver, Last Week Tonight, is actually a HEAVY opinion piece.
It’s a good one to watch though. Especially when they cover something like Carlson, or Trump, or like... 
they cover a lot of people doing moronic things and … they seem to do a consistently good job.
I never really hear Jon use the word cocksucker though... though he does say fuck quite a lot. 
They can’t say “cocksucker” on network television, can they...? Nope.

Whenever it’s network television, you can clearly tell that the person on screen WANTS to swear, you can 
see it in their eyes...? Or like, the way their eyebrows or facial expressions appear to be veiling some 
emotion to say “Fuck you Carlson”, but... they have a calm demeanor on network TV. Brianna Keiler is actually 
pretty good to watch too, and it’s not like her opinion pieces are ever really WRONG. 

They are very … FACT BASED let me tell ya. 
CNN has plenty of great coverage, but it is literally around the clock coverage so the news comes out in drips 
and drabs... Fareed Zakaria is very good too, a lot like Chuck Todd on Meet the Press, get somebody in the seat, 
and literally ask some friggen questions. 

Bill Gates spoke to him recently, it touched on the epidemic and his appearance on Ted several years ago, but 
he’s like ONE dude that could be talking about stuff like this, and I feel like Mr. Gates needs more guys like HIM 
to be more “philantropic” and even educational.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯    
If there’s anything Mr. Gates does successfully, is to inspire other people when he gets on screen. 
Cause he is actually an educator if he’s honest with himself.

Opinion pieces aren’t a bad idea, but that is what Carlson’s segment is. So is Hannity’s. 
NBC Nightly News, is NOT an opinion piece at all, however even NBC's coverage is far from the COMPLETE STORY.

Last Week Tonight is not news, nor does it even try to frame itself as if it IS news...
But, it still conveys plenty of newsworthy material.

For a GOOD opinion piece, you need someone that’s enjoyable to watch 
Jon Oliver is probably one of my favorite hosts to watch. 
TUCKER CARLSON is probably the least favorite host to watch. But- so is Hannity.

That’s pretty bad.
Why...? Cause that network spins everything around, I think the worst part about it is that it looks like 
it’s fuckin’ god damn news. 
... to put more money in RUPERT MURDOCK’s pocket, and his oil/gas/car company buddies. 

So, if they say something like “Bob Lutz, shits his pants again...”... that’s gonna piss off somebody important 
that they don’t wanna piss off, at all.

Jon Oliver makes compelling arguments and analogies... and he can even swear and be original, they can’t do 
what he does on CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC, though some of them definitely try.

Jon Stewart, Samantha Bee, Stephen Colbert, David Letterman, Trevor Noah, they all do some of these things to 
varying degrees, but they’re not really on a television channel where they are free to say whatever the fuck 
they want. Jon Oliver got lucky because he can fuckin’ swear his ass off...

So can I. Anyway, Hannity loves to blow RUPERT MURDOCK. Oh well. What can he do?
Back at some point in history... 
Fox News DID occasionally cover SOME news.
Fox News doesn’t actually report News. 
Not anymore. 

Sometimes it looks like news for a split second...?
But then they say something opinionated, and biased, then it’ll SOUND or LOOK like, a dick just flew into 
somebody’s mouth.
Right there and then.
Which should sound ... fucked up actually. Dicks aren’t just supposed to come flying out of nowhere, 
right into somebody’s mouth, as often as they do on Fox News. So... that is NOT news.
If you think for one second, that could possibly happen, on a news station...?
You’re not watching the fuckin’ news, buddy...
Nah. That’s, gotta be some kind of advanced futuristic porno or somethin’...
News ONLY reports the facts.
News WONT distort the facts.

You’re watchin’ something TOTALLY different, if the facts are being distorted...
And you’ll know the facts are being distorted when it suddenly appears as if...
...somebody just started cobbin’ on some dudes knob mid-sentence.

I know some people are gonna think I mean that literally, so to state the obvious, nah.
Not a literal thing at all.
If someone reads all this, and thinks I’m being literal...? 
Nah. It’s a metaphor.

Anyway... 
New Not News Motto:

Fox...? Changes portions of every story around to work best for them, that’s NOT NEWS.

Technically, that’s being an ASSHOLE. It’s like saying that there are 26 letters in an alphabet, but...
Since THEY only really like 5 letters, fuck the other 21 letters, dude. 

A, B, X, Y, Z are the ONLY letters that we're gonna talk about. Fuck the rest of the letters. They're lame.

Now you’re thinking, what the hell? There’s obviously a lot of missing letters here...

Right. So, things that are MISSING will start to be pretty OBVIOUS if you look for things that SHOULD be a 
part of the story, but aren’t.

So if I have a conversation with somebody...
...and Fox News leaves out chapters of CONTEXT, that also accomplishes the same thing.

Basically, the difference between NEWS and PROPOGANDA is this simple: 
when a news organization calls itself a news organization, anyone reporting the 
news isn’t supposed to like, flirt with the story, or alter it.

Fox News consists of people that get paid a lot of money to push an AGENDA.
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(10,"Discussion [~] Oil Corporation [Agenda] → Deny Climate Change",@"
TUCKER CARLSON, and Sean Hannity are (2) prime examples, of people that never got rich or famous for their 
intelligence. Quite the opposite, actually. They’re constantly pushing an AGENDA.

If anybody reads that, and gets confused by that statement...? 
I’ll clarify exactly what I mean, AND let you on in a little secret...

Not only do BOTH of these useless fucks make over `$100M a year EACH, but the MORE moronic they SOUND...? 
The MORE they get paid.

Here’s why... 
It’s because a billionaire loves to piss his money all over the place to fuck with everyone.
This specific billionaire, thoroughly enjoys manipulating society. That’s the reason.
He, doesn’t realize that doing this "manipulating society"... will probably wind up causing an extinction 
level event.
Here’s what an extinction level event is... it’s when everything on the planet, goes extinct, even people.

Ok, cool. So, guess what’s causing ALL of that shit...? 
Well, unsurprisingly, it’s something that these (2) fucking morons on Fox News, constantly say "doesn’t exist"
Guess what that very existent thing is...? 
It’s called climate change.
But, what seems to be DRIVING climate change the MOST...?

The car, gasoline, and oil industry. OH... Yeah.
So when they ask the following rhetorical question: “How WOULD we support our society without oil or gas...?”
Well, morons that never thought of a transition plan...

It’s a pretty good fuckin’ question. Isn’t it?
If you keep buying oil/gas, you’re still DEPENDENT on it. 
If you lease a vehicle that uses GAS, then you can only use GAS to propel yourself from point A to point B. 
Now what happens when you run out of it...?

Well, the car won’t actually START, aw man. Now you need the power of a magic genie because there’s no gas.

...there’s no magic genie. You gotta walk your ass to the closest gas station, when ya get there, then fill 
up a container. Sometimes you can contact like, idk, 911 or roadside assistance, and they’ll bring the gas 
to YOU. Cause they’re cool like that. It’ll be like 2-3x the cost of gas at the station though, so prepare 
to spend some fuckin’ money. Sorry, they don’t just give this stuff away for free. 

Anyway, let’s say it’s literally a quarter mile away... Hannity, will literally have those guys bring the 
gas there. Cause, the idea of walking is probably... TOUGH bro. A quarter mile to the closest gas station 
is a fuckin’... might as well be walkin’ to the MOON...

Nah. It’s not a bad idea. Walk like a quarter mile if you have no gas...? Even if you have the money...?
Don’t be such a lazy bastard. Walk and get yourself some exercise. Anyway...

What if... the planet just has no oil left, and there’s no gas at that station...?
Well, Hannity will have walked to the gas station for no fuckin’ reason.
Because, he kept denying climate change that whole time, didn’t stop for a single second to listen to people
that know what the hell they’re talking about.

$Book.AddSection(10,"Shoutout [+] My Grandfather Thomas Cook",@"
My grandfather was a trucker who delivered gasoline for the Amerada Hess Corporation all up and down the east 
coast. About 20 years ago, he told me “The planet has about *checks watch* 35 years worth of oil left, by my
calculations.”

My grandfather did this for basically... 50 fuckin’ years or more. When Bob Lutz was shittin’ his pants every 
day at General Motors, my grandfather was hauling gas that eventually made it’s way into every piece of shit 
vehicle that Bob Lutz was responsible for making. As well as many others. Now, Bob Lutz isn’t the ONLY problem,
the OTHER problem, is that the industry actually SNIPED ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS OUT OF EXISTENCE EACH 
AND EVERY TIME THEY TRIED TO EXIST.

But ALSO, a guy in the 80’s, found a way to EXTEND the MILEAGE of the GASOLINE, so that a car that WAS getting 
10 miles per gallon... suddenly got like 100. Awesome. Wanna know what happened to THAT dude...? He was found 
dead one day after he tried to talk to people about it, or sold the formula to a car company.

Cool. There’s a situation where Theodore Roosevelt had to keep an army of watchdogs around, JUST IN CASE, some 
fuckin’ douchebag like Rockefeller decided to rear his ugly fuckin’ head, and require an immediate shot to the 
head. But, I think they all got killed. So, oil companies just love to send some fuckin’ douchebag after ideas 
like ELECTRIC VEHICLES and ANYTHING THAT EXTENDS MILEAGE.

Anyway, my grandfather was responsible for delivering gas, and he told me just how fuckin’ inefficient those 
diesel trucks really are when it comes to delivering gas. Or diesel. Basically, each of those trucks gets 
like... 3 miles a gallon when loaded. If not less. ...that’s been goin’ on for fuckin’ decades...

That might be a GOOD thing to the people that sit around watching their billions → trillions of dollars pouring 
in because they don’t really have anything as expenses if you think about it... Yeah, they have expenses. 
They pale in comparison to the YIELD they get from when it is aggregated. In other words, it’s a resource they 
are EXTRACTING from the fuckin’ ground. It’s just a matter of availability.

So, if Exxon Mobil wanted those oil fields in Kuwait/Iraq back in... August 2001...? 
Guess what they COULD do, to go get some free fucking (oil/money)...? Hm.

What happens is that WHEN the oil runs out... millions of people will die. In record time, too. Unless... 
check it out... People like Elon Musk, build something that doesn’t depend on oil... to move all that stuff 
around. Food...? Tesla Semis. Water...? Ground water. Heat...? Warm clothes, or a fire. Hot showers...? 
Yeah. Nah. Not without switching to solar. Some people will get lucky, but the very real thing people should 
be worried about, is when the cargo ships can’t move anymore. So like, might not be a way to ship goods from 
Asia to America after they can no longer move.

I am raising some alarms here, because the entire economy appears to be VERY DEPENDENT ON OIL.
That includes plastics, and packaging, and so many other chemicals and detergents, medicines, laundry 
detergents, all that stuff is very DEPENDENT on OIL.

When it’s all fuckin’ gone... There won’t be a little meter in real life like there is in your vehicle. 
It’ll just be a fuckin series of RED ALERTS. What I’m suggesting is that, people should already be making    
accommodations and preparing for the worst... because, how can anybody trust someone who’s gonna lie about 
climate change to funnel money into somebody’s pockets...?

Realistically, I think the clock will RUN OUT BEFORE EVERYBODY GETS ON BOARD, and FIGURE THAT OUT.
However, there may not even be THAT much time left, by MY calculations.

See, grandpa told me that was at the rate 20 years ago. 
The demand continues to RISE each year.
Technically, we are probably just about TAPPED OUT NOW.

But- then they started getting oil from the tar sands, and realistically, it’s pretty difficult to know for 
certain how much oil is left. Was my grandfather taking a shot in the dark with that guess...? Well, no.
Some tools use sound waves to detect earthquakes and seismic activity. When these tools are used, they can 
geolocate a vast underground cavern of petroleum to use as a base that becomes oil AND gas after conversion. 
However, people don’t realize just how much fuckin’ gasoline America uses on a daily basis.

If people say “a metric shit ton”, they need an order of magnitude that’s just gonna          (← dwarf that by a lot)
If people say “a million metric shit tons”, they need an order of magnitude that’s just gonna (← dwarf that by a lot)
Well, that 2nd line is not correct... 
Apparently it’s about 33M barrels a day. I’m using an old measurement too. 
Without Google searching it, I would estimate that it is anywhere BETWEEN 33-100M barrels a day.
A barrel is like 32 gallons I think.

I’m trying to do this without actually whipping out a calculator and make some approximations, because really, 
even the most knowledgeable people in the industry are also making approximations.

Guys like Elon, need a lot of fuckin’ help to save a lot of people from dying when it DOES run out.
What a shocker.

It’s a fuckin’ brilliant plan, isn’t it?
The reason why it’s a brilliant plan, is because at SOME point in the future...
...all of the fucking oil WILL be depleted...
...then the oil companies...?
...won’t know what the fuck to do...
...cause they’re morons.

Sorta like how Bob Lutz, wouldn’t know what to do with himself, if he actually knew how to hold his shit in...
...so he could get to the bathroom...
...instead of shitting his pants every day.

That’s an analogy. I don’t know how often Bob Lutz, shits his pants.
But judging by the number of shit vehicles that GM made while he ran it...?
Had to have been a daily thing.
Cause, I wouldn’t feel a need to say such an insulting thing to someone with so much experience...
...if he fuckin’ made an effort to do what Tesla did.

But the only reason he didn’t, is cause he liked shitting his pants every day.
Why though? I can only imagine, that it just felt amazing to him. 
Warm, wet, sticky, it disgusts me to think that he probably won’t even deny it either.
I can imagine that the “jokes” aren’t landing like jokes right now after what I just wrote above.

What can anybody do...?
If a toddler is sitting around in his diaper, and just shit himself, that kid is not gonna be able to clean 
himself up. He pooped himself. It’s not funny...

And that’s the perfect metaphor for the car and oil industry. I’m not gonna suggest that Rockefeller’s 
descendants are all real evil pricks that have to go around killing people with ideas and stuff... cause 
it’s probably not their fault if their great grandfather was a tycoon that had very great control over the 
government and the economy...

$Book.AddSection(10,"Shoutout [+] Theodore Roosevelt: One of the greatest former presidents",@"
Theodore ‘Teddy’ Roosevelt had to deal with monopolies and create policies that needed to be set as an example 
or a rule. The thing about Teddy Roosevelt, was that Teddy would knock a motherfucker out. 
I’m not even kidding, he would kick the shit out of somebody if he felt like it, before he was even a president.

He had a fuckin’ temper but it took a while to really get that side of him to come out. 
This man changed the way these dudes were playing the game. 

Back then, Rockefeller had his ways of being slippery and skirting the law every which way he could, cause 
he was fuckin’ very filthy stinkin’ rich. The government, ALSO very corrupt. 

Anyway, these monopolies thought they could laugh in this mans face. He mailed people a bunch of letters
“stop doing this”, “stop doing that”, but they pretended like they didn’t get those letters. Then he actually
traveled across the country to see why he wasn’t getting responses from those letters. 

It wasn’t really common for a president to travel like that, even up until the early 1930’s, when they had planes.     
Wasn’t entirely RARE, but typically, a president spent a lot of time in the White House.

Anyway, he would show up. He would ask to see the person he sent the letter to, and then march to the office. 
Like in Breaking Bad, when Hank Shraeder visits Lydia at her office by surprise...? 
That’s how Teddy would show up. He’s... there man. No receptionist to tell ya to fuck off. 

He’d get to their office, escorted by either the local police, or even the military, and then he would 
calmly ask these people, “Oh, yeah, I sent you a few letters...” 
So, the person would try to say “Oh, I have been SUPER busy...”

Nah, that’s about the dumbest thing you can say to a president. 
He knew when they were playing this game too.

So, without any warning at all, he just started kicking the shit out of people when they did that.
I mean, he didn’t beat them to a pulp, he just had to punch them REALLY fuckin’ hard ONCE.
One time. That was it.

He didn’t act like George W. Bush does, hiding in his fuckin’ house, and having people lie for him, nah. 
This dude literally would come TO you... then ask questions that, BEFOREHAND, would make a bunch of people 
act like the Sopranos, and laugh in somebody’s face...

But then, if the President of the United States comes up to you, and asks you something... and you happen to 
be the dumb son of a bitch that starts laughing in this dudes’ face...? 
If he punches you in the face ONE TIME... and... you don’t even know what the fuck just hit ya...? 
What does that person do...?

You strike a president, you’re getting arrested. Doesn’t matter if that dude just hit YOU, cause he can do that 
instead of taking you to jail. 
Doesn’t really matter how much money you have, either.
This is somewhat old school America, so, there was no “politics” at play.
Presidents acted a lot like a police officer because they’re part of the executive branch.
Basically a combination of a POLICE OFFICER and a SOLDIER.

Might even have to fine you, for having to knock some sense into you. “Million dollar fine, bub.” 
They stopped laughing.
They weren’t acting like the Sopranos anymore after that, at all.

Nah, cause even Tony Soprano would know better than to piss this dude off.
If Paulie was running his mouth, who’s like a SOLDIER on the Sopranos, Tony would even be tempted to knock 
him out too, just to avoid the million dollar fine for the PRESIDENT having to get his hands dirty.
Didn’t need a vice president to do that FOR him.

These people actually grew to be pretty afraid of this dude because, he’s a nice guy, no need to talk shit 
to him, but if he’s in front of you, he’s there for a pretty good reason, he’s the fuckin’ president.

I am taking some creative liberties in the story of Theodore Roosevelt.
But, this dude would do stuff like that... when I say that he literally went to Panama to hand dig the Panama 
canal, that’s not an exaggeration at all. He did shit like that. However, some of this stuff is very accurate.
"@)

$Book.AddSection(10,"Examination (2)",@"

Yeah. Sean Hannity doesn’t like to tell people this, but he gets paid `$100M a year to keep saying climate 
change is not real. But, it is SO real, that I can practically see a dick in this guys mouth, every single 
time he appears on television. It’s a `$100M per year/dick in the mouth that Hannity, seems to enjoy hittin’ 
with his tonsils.

He can do that if he wants to, it’s a free country. It’s not actually illegal for him to do that.
In Carlson’s case, I figure, this man probably gets pretty pissed off when the girls go to suck HIS dick, 
and they can’t help but giggle. Cause his dick’s probably mad small... And you know what, if a girl fuckin’ 
says "Aw, how cute~!" when she’s (looking at/holding) your dick?

God that’s... gotta fuckin’ suck man.
Look on the bright side... she doesn’t need a pair of tweezers or a microscope.

Anyway, yeah. This year is expected to be the hottest summer in recorded history...
Said some of these things already, but I’m gonna say it again cause of how ALARMING it is.

The last 10 years...? ...check it out.
...8 of the last 10 years were the hottest summers in recorded history... 

Sean Hannity should not have a show. He could STILL get paid to just, suck RUPERT MURDOCK’s dick...?
...then he doesn’t even need to do anything else. Same amount of money.
Doing so would mean he’d be doing the same quality job... just, no show.
Why have a show at that point...? There’s no need for it.

These guys TUCKER CARLSON and Sean Hannity...? 
The both of them...? They’re fuckin’ morons. 
In Carlson’s case, I don’t think he can help it.
In Hannity’s case, I think he actually CAN.

RUPERT MURDOCK enjoys how both of them sound, spamming everyone that watches their network with moronic 
thoughts. Couldn’t be more serious. 
Paid to say some shit every day.
The more brain dead the commentary...? 
The more pleased the boss man is.

A billionaire gets bored, thinks everyone is pathetic. ← I’m not certain this man ACTUALLY thinks that, 
it’s a guess. The goal of Fox News is to get as many idiots as they can, to watch it.

The content doesn’t need to be quality content at all, because the existence of this "news organization"...
...is so that this billionaire can continue to win this fuckin’ bet that he made with another billionaire.

And, RUPERT MURDOCK just crushes souls with how long he’s been keeping the bet going. He’s no idiot, that’s 
for sure. Murdock is NOT paying these guys because they “sound intelligent”. They’re basically actors.
Some people probably think that’s why they’re on all the time, to sound intelligent. Sure, we can call it “that”.

Yeah, maybe some nearly brain dead people DO watch them... and they think either one sounds intelligent.
But, that’s really not THEIR fault if they’re nearly brain dead... they may not be able to change the channel.
Suppose the average viewer has the ability to change the channel... will they?

Not if Tucker has the voice of somebody that sounds like you’re gettin’ a new happy meal toy.    
He sounds excited about basically everything he talks about, basically new a happy meal toy per episode.
“Gotta collect em all, folks.” -McDonalds

Nah, you’re not brain dead if you have a way of somehow looking at the TV or online video...
...and you know you’re lookin’ at some Fox News, featuring TUCKER CARLSON, back-to-back with Sean Hannity.
(2) dudes...? (1) channel. 

They really should do the same thing that George W. Bush and Shayam Sundar did...
...standing side by side with their arms folded. Looking like they run some shit.
Cause, it’s true, they do run some shit. Not like Bob Lutz does, either.

They alone basically give Fox News the minimum ratings needed to do whatever the hell they want for the 
remaining 22 hours a day. That means, they could just have commercials that whole time... and still not 
come even remotely close to what these guys bring in.

They’re not being paid for their intelligence. They’re paid for their obedience. Oil is worth a lot of 
money. Carlson sounds like he knows some shit. Hannity also sounds like he knows some shit... They both 
know some shit, but not much more. 
They hear the truth, and they may as well say out loud, “Look everybody, the truth is fuckin’ lame, anyway.” 
Then some viewers will look at each other and say “...did that dude just say the truth is fuckin’ lame...?”

Uh, yeh. That’s what they started saying one day. Fox News knew that Not News WOULD be a way better name... 
They had to actually start testing people, like dippin’ your toes in a pool, to see how warm/cold the water is.

If F bombs are gonna get hurled, it’s gonna happen in the same week. Because, NBC has a whole entire roster 
of people that are seasoned veterans at never swearing, on camera. So does FOX, and CNN, and all of the rest.
Sometimes you won’t even HEAR about a SINGLE swear word DURING the hours where they’re ALLOWED.

You see, everybody actually swears once they get to be old enough. Some people are more reserved than one 
another, but... society has this mechanism where if you... say something like “cocksucker” on TV...? 
Well, that’s just uncalled for.

Honestly, I really don’t know who the hell came up with these fuckin’ rules, but... 
...at some point people won’t care.

The military swears a lot. Even, I’m sure Joe Biden occasionally throws one around a hot mic. 
Might’ve been recently, OR could’ve even been years ago. The truth is, even Bill Gates says them too. 
Even Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg. Elon Musk, fuckin’ definitely swears sometimes, but not around a lot of people.
Ooooh no. These people will not allow themselves to be in a room where anything is being recorded, sayin’ 
some shit. Or swearin’ like a sailor. 

Once you’re somebody like Hillary Clinton though... all bets are off. She... probably swears more than I do.

But, amazingly, they all train themselves to have like hours, where they won’t dare say a bad word. 
Not even a ‘light’ one like ‘damn’, or ‘hell’. H e double hockey sticks is more like it. 
Nobody sounds less threatening than when they spell out the good ol’ H E double hockey sticks... 
...that’s what my 4th grade teacher Mrs. Lattimore used to say.

Anyway...

Fox News still needs to transition over to the new name. 
Cause they know... it would make their lives easier. 
__________________________________________________________________________________
| Used to be News...? Now we’re not news. Not News. Part of the Not News Network |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
^ That’s emblematic. It’s a slogan, it’s a question, a statement, and basically a motto.
Starting with a question “Used to be News...?”
Cause it legitimately will have brand new news to say until it is converted into something that WAS news.
Right...? 

But then at that exact moment where it was NEW news, it became Not News.
If that sounds confusing, sorry I... 
I’m just saying that they get the news → it’s no longer news even though it used to be the second before.

TUCKER CARLSON had this stint where he cost Murdock a couple of Primetime F bombs, and... that wasn’t good.
If the president swears near a hot mic, when Obamacare is signed into law, yeh... he wasn’t wrong.
It was a BIG fuckin’ deal, man.

But, that’s actually an entertaining reality, that has a curse word that made it tantalizing.
It was already a tantalizing story, because not a single president in history, was able to set the achievement 
that Barack Obama set, by bein’ a fuckin’ awesome president... first form of universal healthcare for every 
American, covering preexisting conditions. But the thing needs some serious updates. Everyone knows that. 
It actually... causes a lot of doctors to COMMIT MEDICAL FRAUD. Not his fault though.

Obama might not drive up in a limo to a bunch of dude’s rapping on the street corner, open the door, ask em to 
hand over the mic, and then say “I’m the leader of the free world.” *drops mic* ...and then adjust his suit 
real quick, get back in his limo, and take off. But- Obama is cool enough to respect that as comedic, AND openly 
talk about his anger translator, Luther. Jordan Peele did a number of bits where he pulled off a respectable 
version of Barack Obama. Yeh. Obama thought that shit was funny.

Is George Bush gonna do something like that...? I don’t really know actually.
What I DO know is that Alec Baldwin spent plenty of time mocking President Trump, and somehow the incident 
on Rust, IS VERY BAD.

Will Ferrell wasn’t mocking GWB at all, really... but does he have a sense of humor? Who knows.
Was GWB a dick or was he cool about every appearance Will Ferrell made, trying to be funny... 
lookin’ like him...? I have no idea what the ol’ Bushmeister thought.

Sometimes, I have to type up many forms of statements in order to READ it, and then, reading it makes sense.
Other times, reading it DOES NOT make sense, and then I gotta change it.

Anyway, someone thought that they should perform the equivalent of throwing a condom over our language on TV.
That’s why sometimes Fox News will get the news, and then they don’t even tell anybody what it is...
...they made an executive decision to say how fuckin’ lame it was real quick, and they just...
...took off, man.

I’m not sure what the hell ever actually happened to Fox News.
So I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again...
...they really should change the name of the entire company, to Not News.

It would be something for RUPERT MURDOCK to be proud of.
Back when Duck Tales used to be on all the time, Fox was a channel that I was GLUED to. 
Wasn’t trying to be news, yet.
I watched a lot of episodes of Duck Tales in the late 80’s, cause it was one of my favorite shows.
I’m talkin’, the original 1980’s Duck Tales, Scrooge swimming in a bank full of coins, WXXA/TV-23 Fox.

Old school Duck Tales, was awesome, I recorded episodes on a VCR, and just kept watching Duck Tales like no tomorrow.
That’s nothing to be ashamed of.

My mother used to say I would say “Duck Tales this” and “Duck Tales that”... Not even remotely kidding.
Now, I eventually outgrew Duck Tales. But, Fox did too... they grew alongside me. 

When X-Files was on TV, people would watch THAT.
The kids would say “Hey, did you see the new X-Files last night...?”
Other kid would say “No WAY man... that stuff SCARES me...”

Nothing like being a kid, scared shitless of aliens popping out of nowhere to abduct Scully or Mulder again.

X-Files was a good show. So was X-Men. Simpsons, Spiderman, then eventually Family Guy, and American Dad, a lot of 
this stuff made it to many other networks on syndication. It’s not like Fox had shit content all these years, that’s 
not the fuckin’ problem. 

The problem is, something changed from then → now. They did indeed start covering news. 
It was not bad news that they reported. 
They reported plenty of things that were credible over the years, but it’s obvious that they’re not considering the 
same things that guys like Elon Musk are considering, and these networks need to be woken up.

There’s a possibility that RUPERT MURDOCK, probably doesn’t realize how fuckin’ grave the situation is, and he should
probably cut it out with having these fuckfaces say that climate change isn’t real. Cause, it definitely is, and it’s
fuckin’ dangerous. So, I’m gonna continue... 

One day back in 1996, Fox finally decided to whip out the fuckin’ microphones and lay down the news coverage law.

Friends might’ve even been on, too.

But... at some point along the way, someone said "Suppose we just hire people that LOOK trustworthy?”
“They don’t HAVE to be trustworthy at all...“

Then, that’s exactly what they fuckin’ did.
Bill O’Reilly, one of those people. Looks trustworthy. Isn’t. It’s not like he wasn’t entertaining nor

He just has no ability to recant when he goes way too far, and doesn’t apologize for those lapses in judgment.

Just like Putin. Mutual morons, joining forces, holding hands, giggling like a couple of love-struck idiots...
The nature of egregiousness causes them both to be rather DANGEROUS.
Trump, and Putin.
Hannity, and Murdock.
Carlson, by himself... invited some girl, but she said ‘I’ll pass’.
That’s how the ‘Aw~! It’s so cute!’ comment will get ya if you’re a small-dicked bastard like Carlson.

Anyway, this whole series of people, day in, day out... they both know how to take that to the next level. 
Sometimes, they don’t even have to try. 
How the fuck, does someone actually pull that off...?
Well... 

It really is difficult to put into words, what a sick fuckin’ joke this all is.
I really should paste a link here... of a video that I think... every auto manufacturer should study, examine, 
and unpack and unfold, and then people really will have to ask themselves...
“We probably could’ve done this sooner, saved the planet from getting this fucked up, couldn’t we have?”
Tesla Model S Plaid – Nuremburg World Record | https://youtu.be/Ujp3q_aryRA 
This thing... is basically the fastest car in the world...
...doesn’t use any gas...
...sounds pretty fuckin’ cool when it accelerates...
...doesn’t use any gas...
...fast as fuck acceleration too...
...doesn’t use any gas...
...could theoretically be charged with solar panels...
...doesn’t use any GAS...
...pisses off a lot of people that spent their whole life tuning the shit out of cars and engines...
...doesn’t actually use ANY gas...

I don’t know man. It is a fuckin’... tough decision. Man, oh man...
Who the hell wants to skip paying for gas...?
What...? No fuckin’ WAY bro... I need to buy gas, always.
Someone tries to tell me that there’s an actual way to not have to spend ANY money on gasoline...?
That dude’s getting’ a fuckin’ middle finger to the face bro... no way.
*tapping chest* I’m buyin’ some fuckin’ gas dude. Nobody’s gonna stop me.
Not one person. I wear T-shirts every day that say “I fuckin’ by some god damn gas, alright...”
I’m not gonna bother... changing anything.
Cause, why would anyone not buy gas...?
That’s fuckin’ stupid, bro.
Oil changes are ALSO my favorite thing to spend a lot of money on.
Fuck groceries or food. My car’s fuckin’ hungry. That’s a LOT more important than ME.

Yeah. This is the message that TUCKER CARLSON, and Sean Hannity literally SHOULD say.
It won’t change how fuckin’ obvious their message is...
Well, for some people, it probably will.

What happens when NASCAR goes extinct, when there’s no OIL left...?
Oh well, an entire industry of people that lived from point A to point B... they fuckin didn’t know what to 
fuckin’ do with themselves once the oil was all gone. 

Now, what the fuck are the 8~ billion people gonna do...? 
Even if everybody STOPPED RIGHT NOW, and did something amazing to propel the advancement of carbon 
nanotube based batteries... they won’t arrive soon enough to stop billions of people from dying, and 
I’m nearly certain of it.
People really should consider the notion, that EVERY company that hasn’t started to REFINE RECHARGEABLE 
BATTERIES, is gonna have NO FUCKIN’ FUTURE.

The way I see it is this is a serious problem, because, I don’t think the ELITES that have all the money 
and resources, that they’re ready to get into their nuclear winter shelters or bunkers, and once the shit 
hits the fan...? Extinction level event.

Here’s how it will unfold. Gas gets to be 35.00 a gallon. Double cheeseburgers at McDonalds will be 
100.00. Toothpaste might be maybe `$50.00. Toilet paper...? Doesn’t get made anymore. No way to refine 
the paper. McDonalds won’t even use paper anymore either, it’ll all be glassware. Yeah. That’s how fuckin’ 
stupid all this shit sounds, right?

Someone’s gonna start launching nuclear weapons because SOMEBODY has some fuckin’ OIL, and someone 
ELSE doesn’t. This shit sounds alarmist and scary doesn’t it...? But- hey. You get (2) cocksuckers that 
lie every day, no problem dude. There’s no fuckin’ way that this shit will ever happen, right?
Well, think again fuckface. It might.

Exxon Mobil and General Motors like the message that Hannity and Carlson rant about.
They’re incredibly consistent at it... and that’s why General Motors and Exxon Mobil make sure that Tucker 
and Hannity get 100M a year. They don’t actually care if Tucker or Hannity sound like morons, apparently a 
lot of other people believe in both of them. I don’t think Hannity or Carlson realize that the people making 
sure they get paid, they have absolutely no respect for them whatsoever. 

They’re getting paid all of that money, because the person paying them, KNOWS they’re both morons.

Nothing like someone throwing money at you, and telling you what a fuckin’ dumbass you are, for not realizing 
the game. It’s teamwork. One hand washes the other. One dude looks like a moron for a while, and then, another 
dude looks like moron for a while. Back-to-back moronhood. With their moronic capabilities combined...? 
*Scoffs* people don’t actually stop and think "Why the hell are these idiots always on TV?" 

That strategy, is, paying some dude like `$100M+ a year, to talk in front of a camera, and just sit in front of 
the camera as long as possible. Because, the more time they’re in front of the camera, the less time they have 
to read things like 1) books, 2) newspapers, 3) what educated people say, 4) anything educational...

$Book.AddSection(10,"Excerpt [~] Square peg, round hole",@"
I know someone’s gonna say "But, they have a teleprompter that they read all the time..." Sure they do. 
You really think these guys know how to read...? Words? Nah. 
They don’t have time to read WORDS, dude... 
They just look at pictures, like a little toddler putting the square peg in the round hole... 
"If you keep at it, that square peg WILL go in the round hole." -TUCKER CARLSON.

No it won’t, dude. They teach little kids about that in like, kindergarten, along with your ABC’s and 123’s.
Square...? 4 flat sides. 
Circle...? 0 flat sides. 
That’s like first or second grade when they EXPLAIN the shapes.

But in kindergarten, you’ll be seeing some blocks, shapes, and boards.

I know people will try to tell me "He can’t be a moron if he’s rich and has a job at Fox News..." 
Yeah, he can be... Look at how long he’s been trying to fit a fuckin’ square peg through a round hole.

Lester McNair and I didn’t always get along... but he did occasionally prove that he was no idiot.
People try to fit a square peg through a round hole... 
And TUCKER CARLSON tries to do that every day, and has been doing this over the last 10 years or so...

That’s how much of a moron Carlson, is. He does SOUND intelligent sometimes. 
But, that’s because he knows those coloring books that he uses as the teleprompter, like nobody’s business.
People don’t like realizing how much of a moron he is... but he can’t read. 

He just knows shapes and colors.
Doesn’t know that a square peg will NEVER fit into a round hole...
But, whatever man, he’s getting’ $100M+ a year to TRY to get it through, anyway.
The analogy is far more applicable, than people think.

The executives at Fox news... they said to themselves... 
"This TUCKER CARLSON dude kinda looks like an oblivious toddler that shows such devotion toward fittin’ a 
fuckin’ square peg in a round hole." They don’t care how he sounds or what he says. They care mostly about the 
fact that this dude, has no fuckin’ clue why they keep him in front of the camera. The executives just 
constantly laugh at this dude. I do too.

Every time I see this dude, I think "Wow. That is... TUCKER CARLSON right fuckin’ there man. Holy shit..."
...and sometimes I can’t stop laughing.

It’s not really HIM they’re laughin’ at so much as it is the people that watch their network. 
Because, these guys get a power trip off of being able to say whatever the hell they want. 

"We can literally do no wrong, and people will just keep watchin’ this dude. This is fuckin’ priceless." -Fox News

The thing is, it wouldn’t need to be such a laughingstock of a cable TV network...
...if they just stopped calling it Fox News. 
If they changed it from Fox News to Not News.
One word could’ve saved this entire document from needing to be written at all. Ya know?

Realistically though, that’s a HUGE generalization, AND, pretty inaccurate.
But hey. I can … call myself out on that.
Carlson doesn’t do that... Neither does Hannity.

It’d still have "News" in it’s name... same bullshit it had before too. Every day. 
Could still deny climate change, could still pay Tucker and Hannity their fat stacks of cash. 
The only difference would be that the NAME of the network was able to do right by people.

Not News : Well, we WERE Fox News for about... oh... give or take 10 years? 
           1996 to 2006.
           Then we became something NEW, without the S.
           Wasn’t exactly NEWS... but still, somethin’ NEW.
           *chuckles* Heh, we sure as hell made our network have the LOOK and FEEL of a news network...
           ...when it wasn’t NEWS at all.
           Just somethin’ NEW. 
           No S. 
           Then in 2022, some dude gave us a suggestion that we stand by till this day.
           ...now we’re the Not News Network. 
           Used to be Fox News.

What the fuck, can I get paid to roast these sons of bitches every day...? 
Just call this dude a fuckin’ moron each and every day, ALOT more often than John Oliver does...?

Fox doesn’t just suck ass now. 
It provides NEW ass to be able to suck on, and then it can suck even MORE ass...
Or like a black hole of ass, sucking ass, generating new ass out of nothing, so nothing becomes somethin’, 
and that something just so happens to resemble... 

Like a Rube Goldberg machine of ass sucking... 
Starting with one ass... suckin’ on it, getting kicked over by a pole with a shoe on it.
Then a ball starts rolling down a slide... gets to the second ass, sucks on that one too... 
 
Timer goes off then a thing of chattering teeth gets goin toward the stairs, starts rolling down the stairs, 
gets to the bottom and there’s the third ass... 

Sucks on that one for a while, a while longer, the third ass is special.

Half an hour later, now the alarm clock is goin’ off, knocked over a cup of water. 
The water drained off of a surface and filled up a gutter like catcher thing, now it’s filling up a glass. 
The glass is just about FULL, and then now, the ball gets dropped onto the surface of the water... then the 
glass gets knocked over onto a slide... goes onto a funnel... goes down a hose... at the end of this hose...? 

A fourth ass, now this ass gets to be sucked on, and then the dominoes start to get knocked over... now you’re 
really lookin’ at a show now... five additional asses just came out of nowhere.

What I just said, was me describing a Rube Goldberg entrapment, of ass sucking. 
I mean, they could be nice asses to suck on, but they may not be either. 

If they’re asses like the one Amber Burdo had, then those are nice. Not gonna complain about that. 
But if it’s not that... but it’s some other girls ass... might be ok, but maybe it might not be. 
Depends. But I think the truest thing I can really say is, there are probably other things to do... 
than just suck some asses all day long. Right...?

Can’t really remember a time in my whole life, where I asked myself...
Me: Hey. You know what..? I can trust the Fox News Network, any fuckin’ day of the week. Can’t I...?

Nah. The reason WHY... is because at some point in my life...? I was told that it exists.
But- just cause you know something exists, doesn’t necessarily mean that you HAVE to give a shit...
And that’s what went on up until like, 2016. Oh cool Fox. Awesome. 
Bill O’Reilly was about the coolest dude they had for a while...
...who just so happened to be quite skilled at being a bit of a miserable prick.
Interesting...? Sometimes. Had an attitude...? Sure... Found harassing his coworkers...? ...yeah.
He’s like a much more successful version of Andrew Cuomo, to be perfectly honest.

Maybe I had em all wrong, and so, I could depend on this news organization, for little pieces of news here 
and there. But then again, I do distinctly remember Hillary Clinton being raided in July 2016 by the FBI, 
and watching it on both Fox News, and CNN. Switching between Donald Trump somehow being on the campaign trail, 
and my god I fuckin’ wish Bernie Sanders could’ve made it farther than he did. Because here’s the thing. 

I actually BELIEVED that Trump, might make America great again.
While he made SOME noteworthy accomplishments, he was never half the President Obama was, nor really even 
Bush. THAT has got to speak volumes, that a president I think committed TREASON on 9/11... was STILL a better 
fuckin’ president than Donald Trump. But anyway, when I saw FBI RAIDING CLINTON, I said to myself, good. 
She’s being arrested, who will be running for president, then?

Well, CNN had information updates... “HILLARY NOT BEING ARRESTED... WTF”
Fox News was just quite delayed on that. “IS HILLARY BEING ARRESTED...?”
...and then the feed just kinda blacked out and they did the whole “experiencing technical difficulties”
CNN actually had footage of Comey takin’ off. Givin’ her a wave goodbye. 

I am glossing over the Fox News coverage. They had basically the same source of footage.
Key difference... Fox News fuckin’ did some voodoo magic or some shit to help get Trump elected. 
The Russians did too.
CNN...? Not quite as consistent as NBC, but then again, CNN is all around the clock coverage... 
NBC is not. Unless you’re talkin about MSNBC, which has the opinionated fluff throughout the day.

In reference to the Fox News stations, the local stations I feel bad for. 
They actually cover real news. I’m sure they all think TUCKER CARLSON is a fuckin’ moron too.

I have to have respect for a dude who amps himself up that much every day, and yet...

Maybe he just gets overwhelmed after a few seconds of looking at the square peg.

That’s why he gets paid 100 million dollars a year.
Because you really have to be a total moron to not see what’s wrong with that picture. 
Some rich dude pretends Tucker and he are like, best friends in the world. 

Brings the cuban cigars, and they go golfing. 
Tucker has never played golf.
He’ll talk shit to people about their golf game, and then pay someone to golf FOR him. 
Then that dude kicks everybody’s ass at golf *every* time.

So, Tucker tells himself he’s got style... he doesn’t have to put any thought into anything. Why...?
Cause whether it’s his buddy who’s awesome at golf, or the coloring book that they use instead of a teleprompter 
(since he can read the coloring book), doing ALL of the thinking for him...
Or the stockpile of cash in his possession...

The more he tries to sound intelligent...? 
The less intelligent he actually sounds to others.
*HE* thinks he sounds *more* intelligent when he tries harder...
...but being a moron will cause you to think stuff like that... cause it has the opposite effect.

At least with Sean Hannity, that dude probably IS intelligent when he’s not in front of a camera. I can tell.
He can read a god damn book alright. Pretty sophisticated books too. Sometimes he has to give Tucker advice on 
what certain words or terms actually mean. 

Anyway... 
When THIS dude is in front of a camera, he’s reading from an ACTUAL teleprompter.

Every time people watch Fox news...? 
People probably believe that its GOTTA be news... since it’s part of the name, right? Wrong. 
It’s not news at all, its one long winded opinion with bits and pieces of truth that get squashed back down, 
and  stretched out like Ted Cruz’ asshole by Exxon Mobil’s bribery money.

Observations that anyone else could ALSO make.
Fox isn’t news, at least for the most part. 
The difference between NEWS and NOT NEWS, is when the person or parties speaking on television, if their 
RHETORIC sounds as if it is taking sides...? Then that means that’s not news.
A good way to showcase an example is like this...

“Buy a Google Pixel, ya fucks~! You don’t wanna be caught with your pants down with an Apple iPhone, do ya...?”

That’s someone’s opinion, passing off their opinion to people that don’t know what news is. 
That example is also aggressive marketing. 
So is this:
“You don’t wanna be seen as a total douchebag. Don’t buy THAT shit. Buy THIS shit. It’s the best for a reason.”

I realize they will argue that they DO report the news. I will say that it’s only news when you report the 
facts, not portions of truths, and mid-sentence, injecting a misinformed opinion again.

That’s what Fox News does every time I watch it.
It’s not like a single entity, it’s the whole organization and its culture. 
It’s like Bill O’Reilly, telling people "Shut the fuck up~! We’re doin’ it live~!"
Bill O’Reilly, was pretty entertaining at some point in time.
Then he made it to TV. After that he was sort of a dick...
I’m kidding. He was entertaining on TV.
How else would I have seen him...?

Sometimes what happens is that people get these fits of rage when they are famous or rich.
They’ll feel like they can do whatever the fuck they feel like doing.
Then, someone records a video... of a man laying there in a Motel 6, and an Exxon Mobil sign...
...makin’ that guy scream.

Then, sometimes they realize that was a pretty stupid fuckin’ way to think.
Sometimes, they never reach that realization at all.

The point being, none of the things I just rattled off are "news". 
Some of those ideas would be perfect over at Comedy Central. 
I don’t laugh when I watch Fox News because these people are trying to be FUNNY... 
I laugh when I watch Fox News because these people are trying to be SERIOUS. 

If you want people to take you seriously, but they keep laughing at you...?
Try not sounding like a moron, and see if that changes anything.

Carlson tries to be serious every moment that he’s on the air, but he should to stand up because he’s pretty 
funny. He’s not trying to be funny. He just comes off that way. That’s bad.

Hannity, sounds serious when he’s on the air, happens to be paid extremely well by big oil and the car 
industry. However, anyone watching or listening to him will have to expect...
...that at any fuckin’ moment at all...
...a dick may suddenly fly into his mouth.
That’s cause a fallacy just came on screen. At the speed of sound.

That’s only because, he stopped stating facts, started stating predictable opinions.
AKA, a dick flew into Hannity’s mouth so fast...? Nobody saw it.
That’s gotta scare some fuckin’ people...
The man probably is not a moron after all, might be a moderately intelligent person.
But- once he’s on camera, he tells that impression to fuck off... now he’s a moron.

If the topic of cars or gas comes up, obviously he’s gonna make his benefactors seem like they are gods.
His entire demeanor changed as a result of the topic shifting to something he gets paid a lot of money for.
While there’s not a real dick flying into this dudes mouth at any given moment on camera, it’s a metaphor 
for what I just said.

When I say Hannity knows how to sound like a moron, he’s an expert at it. 
Not only does he easily convince me that he just had a stroke or some shit, mid-sentence...
...but he also helps me feel that my time would be better spent, watching anything else.

He’s perfect at doin’ that. So is Tucker. 
You really have to be a dumb motherfucker, to somehow cause me to stop watching what you’re saying or doing.
I was overloaded by a sensation I didn’t really care for...

In Tucker’s case, I think that he has no idea how fuckin’ moronic he sounds with each passing phrase... 
Hannity at least appears to have some control over how he comes across, but the end result is not much 
different.

Maybe at some point in the future, it’ll become legal for a government task force...
...to issue warning shots when news reporters say false things on a broadcast...
...maybe they’d stop doing it if they saw one of their own accumulate too many warning shots...
...and then get actually shot.
But that’s probably a rather extreme way to handle someone that lies a lot on camera. 

Instead of the soldiers joining the military, and risking their lives for their own country, getting shot at, 
getting injured, and then coming home to a country full of ungrateful fucks, maybe the “reporters” who can’t 
report actual news (like Hannity or Carlson), should do what Richard Engel does.

$Book.AddSection(10,"Shoutout [+] Tribute to Richard Engel",@"
NBC has a shadow warrior named Richard Engel.
Dude goes way deep into enemy territory, blends in like a soldier, whips out his camera, tells the facts, 
gives falsehoods a middle finger.

This dude Richard Engel has a demeanor that says "Oh I’ll fuckin’ go where ever bro... I’m all about that." 
Then, that’s what he does.

His motto should be: “It’s time to kick ass, and chew bubblegum. *checks for gum* Damn... I’m all out of gum.”
(that’s Duke Nukem though...)
...with the assumed following statement... “Guess that means it’s just time to kick some ass, then...”

Richard Engel asks questions, finds answers, survives, travels, repeats.
Some assholes on the other side of town, shooting live ammunition...?
Well, fuck. Richard Engel knows what to fuckin’ do, alright. 
Duck, and cover, but keep your eyes peeled... then, when it’s safe...?
Well, by all means, let us know what’s goin’ on.
Stay safe and survive, my friend.

I could imagine myself doing that too some day...

Me : Audio log, 1436 Friday, May 27th, 2022...
     I’m in Ukraine, and the Russian fuckfaces are on the other side of the valley I’m walking through.
     I’m with an outfit of rag-tag soldiers dressed for a real firefight at anytime...
     Our drones scouted ahead, and we don’t see any forces for the next several miles.
     We’re planning on setting up a base camp for the night, peering over a ridge that oversees it all.
     The Ukrainians are really fuckin’ em up, too.
     Every few minutes is another explosion, a javelin...
     Everybody knows it’s the sound of a Javelin with the sound they make...
     First it sounds like a *pop* then you hear the *fizzle*
     *fizzle* gets more and more faint... *boom*
     4 to 6 Russian soldiers, dead now.
     May they rest in peace.
     It’s never a dull day here in Ukraine... fightin’ this fuckfaced clown, VLADIMIR PUTIN.
     But- when it comes to freedom, and laying down some suppressive fire...?
     *scoffs* We’re gonna be there to see it go down.
     We’ll keep you updated soon. Over and out.

He might occasionally tempt himself by callin’ some enemy forces a bunch of cocksuckers here or there...
...but- he wouldn’t dare say that in a broadcast. Nah.
He does think of the word at times, I’ll bet.

Carlson couldn’t be 1/4 of the reporter that dude is, if he literally spent all of his money having a security 
team protect his ass. These other organizations have many guys that DO a lot of the things Richard Engel does...

            Hey everybody. 
            Climate change isn’t real, but whatever. 
            I’m in Afghanistan.
Villagers : *pointing at Carlson, laughing*
Carlson   : *nervous* I don’t know what the hell any of these people are even saying...? 
            But, it looks more and more dangerous every minute.
            We’ll keep you posted, back to you Sean.
            Alright, end of broadcast.
            Whew.

Carlson would probably shit a brick to do even half of what this dude Richard Engel has done.
Pretty sure Richard Engel would never have to worry about that... Nah.
Dude’s probably able to sleep like a baby through actual gunfire.
So, firecrackers aren’t likely to get him to spaz the fuck out, man... Not him.

When groups of corporations work together to slander scientists, pollute the fuckin’ planet... 
...kill animal species willy nilly, kill rainforests, allow hurricanes to get worse...
...tornadoes to get worse, wildfires to get worse...

You gotta figure that the human race and all living species on the planet may go extinct real soon.
But, you can’t say any of that without causing panic or alarm.
If you say it casually though, it might slip by...
But some people will take notice and maybe they will pay closer attention.

The problem is that these people can do all these fuckin’ things, and they aren’t worried in the least, 
about ever getting caught or getting in trouble, or getting hurt for doing all these terrible things. 

But hey, TUCKER CARLSON fuckin’ gets 100M a year to be the face of Fox News. 
None of that other shit actually matters. 

Tucker will even say, it’s pretty annoying that the other news organizations don’t follow the REAL story...
Like, him. Being fuckin’ way awesome every god damn day.

The thing is...? 
Everyone gets kinda sick of watching a toddler trying to get a square peg, through a round hole. 

For like... the last 10 years, man.
The channel could probably be an enjoyable thing to watch if they changed their name to NOT NEWS. 
"@)

$Book.AddSection(10,"Excerpt [+] Not News Trailer (1)",@"
Trailer : Wanna see a grown ass man try to get a square peg through a round hole...?
Well... look no further.
Not only do you get the most up to date … details that happen to be Not News-worthy...?
Well, NOW you get to see another exciting episode, of a grown ass man...
Doin’ what he seems to do BEST...
And that is...?
…said it already...
…A man, who is the most skilled in the industry...
...at staring down problems...
...face to face...
…with the square peg, and the round hole.
It's almost like Carlson himself, facing off against the Faceless Man...
...the song from the smash hit 1999 album by the band Creed...
What more could anybody really ask for, from a news channel...?
Used to be news...? Now it’s Not News. Not News. Part of the Not News Network.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Cause then people could say ‘HEY... DID YOU SEE THAT THING ON NOT NEWS...?’ 
Then people would start to have these guessing games with each other as to whether some shit they saw on 
NOT NEWS actually happened, OR, NOT NEWS rick rolled their viewers again.

What if it was both things at the same time though...? 
Not News reported stuff that wasn’t fucking newsworthy (as to be expected), but then somehow they 
misreported a story, and some accurate information slipped right by everybody...

They could actually get upset with themselves "Damn it, WE reported newsworthy shit just now, didn’t we?"
Other guy says "I’m afraid so bro. Actual news. Not not news."
Well, now they’re fucked... 

They signed a non-disclosure agreement to ONLY report inaccurate shit all the time, NO EXCEPTIONS.
Used to be news...? Now it’s not news. Not News. Part of the Not News Network.
"Don’t believe a single fuckin’ word we say~!" -Murdock

They should consider changing their name, to that.
If Murdock chose to do that...?
Maybe no one will be able to tell.
Might be considered going in a little close to the hip...

But the payoff would be enormous, because whether you reported something that WAS news, or some false shit...?
Now you’re *really* fucking with everybody.

It’d be a great idea, cause then people could watch just for fun.
Some people already do that, but most people think it’s real life stuff. 

Changing their name to Not News Network, would send the message "We really don’t want ANY credibility at all".

That would send the perfect message that people could take the whole channel seriously while not giving a flying 
fuck, cause it wouldn’t be news. It isn’t news already, but then everyone would know 
“Oh, it’s *eyebrows up* NOT news.” 

So when someone comes in to the office:

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

But then you gotta remember...

Now, look at the potential stories they could use, I just wrote down a whole bunch of things that 
Carlson or Hannity could believably say if they could openly admit that they don’t give a rats ass...
Lying is fine, someone pays them a `$100M every year, to do just that. So, they don’t give a shit who feels what. 

If anything, Fox News changing it’s name, to the Not News Network, that would put em ahead if you think about it.

Cause, people constantly cramming things down people’s throats all day long, that’s not news...  
Might actually be pornography. But, there’s still plenty of lying cocksuckers either way. 
Most people don’t get it... 

Maybe the term COCKSUCKER, is OFFENSIVE to some people. 
Oh well.
The term is QUITE ANCIENT, believe it or not.
They thought this way in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome.

I know I said this previously in the document, but I’ll cover it again.

If someone is LYING, that’s FALSE information.
If someone has bad logic, that’s called a FALLACY 
If someone has a dick, then PHALLUS is the Latin word for DICK. 

The word FALLACY, is ALMOST the same thing as the (phonetically) Latin word PHALLUS.
FALSE looks a hell of a lot like those words, doesn’t it?
FELLATIO also looks like those words, which means the process of “cobbin’ on a mans’ knob”
FELLATE is the PROCESS of sucking on a penis.

They all sorta go hand-in-hand with some fake-ass, falsehood.
Falsehoods basically mean that SOMEONE is CHOOSING to be a COCKSUCKER... 
...the question is, who...?

Whether they’re a LYING COCKSUCKER, CLOSET-CASE COCKSUCKER...
...some DERIVATIVE or VARIATION of this event, is either 1) taking place, or 2) has ALREADY taken place.

I’m not gonna get upset with somebody that has a vagina and naturally likes chokin’ on a big, fat D... 
Or even a guy that likes other guys... like Tim Cook. Not gonna get upset with him sexual preferences at all.
It’s ok if these people enjoy FELLATING a man.

But there’s a metaphorical form of being a cocksucker where it has nothing to do with an actual cock or penis 
at all. Which may, or may not be happening in tandem, of an actual act of penis being slipped in somebody’s 
mouth somewhere.

When someone says some false-hooded, fake-ass, inaccurate information, well, that’s a lying cocksucker alright.

Events like James Comey July 5th, 2016... That dude, was a straight up lying cocksucker that day.
Andrew Cuomo is a lying cocksucker, George Bush was a lying cocksucker, Obama found himself to be a lying 
cocksucker a few times but I forgive him cause he’s better than really any other recent president I can 
think of, Trump- straight up lying cocksucker. Wish I never voted for his ass. Biden, I actually like the 
dude. But it sucks that I like this guy and he’s getting fuckin’ beat up one side and beat down the other, 
inflation, Afghanistan, Ukraine, COVID19... This dude has not gotten a fuckin’ break AT ALL...

But, Ya know, someone’s probably gonna say that I must need to go talk to somebody... cause, I doubt that 
TUCKER CARLSON would ever talk about all this shit. Nope. Probably pays somebody to write stuff FOR him...

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Carlson : Hey buddy, here’s 500 bucks, write this god damn story. 
    Guy : Ah, ok. 
          What...?
Carlson : *waves hands around* I don’t know bro, write whatever. 
          About me. 
    Guy : ...anything specific at all...?
Carlson : Buddy, you’re askin’ too many questions. 
          Just, write whatever. 
          I don’t care.
    Guy : ooooooKkkk...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

So, that dude wound up writing a MUCH LESS INTERESTING story, than this whole document, for `$500 bucks. It said: 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Story : Hey, TUCKER CARLSON.
        Fuckin’, bein' quite a badass all the time.
        I’m alive, I’m real...? 
        What the hell can anybody do about it?

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

End of story. Carlson would pay somebody to write a story and get that one thing for `$500.

Yeah, Tucker is the type of dude who thinks that everyone will do something for `$500, probably.

But, here's where things get ACTUALLY interesting.
If Tucker wants to talk some shit to somebody, and tell them that they'll get their ass kicked at golf...? 
He’s got a dude that always wins every game for him, for `$500, and THAT is how this dude remains interesting.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

          I’ll bet you `$500 bucks, that you’ll fuckin’ get your ass kicked at golf...

          Who the fuck do you think you even are, chum....?
Carlson : Tucker god damn Carlson, that’s who.
Lutz    : Yeah...? 
          Carlson eh...? 
          That dumb son of a bitch on Fox News...?

          *points* You...?

          *hand gesture* Ass whooping.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I’m not being paid `$100M/year like some moron on Fox News who struggles to realize that you can't fit a square 
peg through a round hole... so theoretically, some asshole is gonna tell me that I have some fuckin nerve, to 
tell Fox News, that they should CONSIDER REPORTING SOME NEWS SOMETIME. 

The thing is, they can in fact report PORTIONS of what may be considered NEWSWORTHY, from time to time... 
They’re no fuckin’ stranger to what NEWS is...

However, the reality is that I consider Fox News to be like the gay kid who hangs out with some hot girl.
He gets lonely and doesn't wanna go home to masturbate and cry all by himself...

So, the gay kid is no fuckin’ stranger to that hot bitch he keeps hangin’ out with...
But he’ll never, ever fuck that girl. Nope. 
Just like how Fox News will never really report the NEWS. Nope.

Wanna know why...? 
It’s mainly because... that kid is gay.
Now, apply that concept to Fox News...
...how it intercepts the news, and changes it to something that isn’t fuckin’ news.

It's called PROPAGANDA. It's not TOO different from dick-in-the-mouth-hood.

The reason that they are certain to collect the facts, and then, spin them around somehow... 
...is because a billionaire bought the network, to make the entire world suck on his metaphorical dick, every day. 
Cause, being that god damn rich, causes guys like HIM to get fuckin’ bored, since he doesn't know how to be a 
PRODUCTIVE rich bastard like Gates, Musk, Buffett, Bezos, or Zuckerberg.

Yeah. I threw the dude I've been pretty pissed about half of the book long, into that list of PRODUCTIVE PEOPLE.
His name is MARK ZUCKERBERG. HE is STILL, MORE PRODUCTIVE, than RUPERT MURDOCK will EVER be.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Sean Hannity has this shit down to a science. 
Whenever the cameras are not rolling, or recording, or on the air, that dude is probably a rather intelligent
individual. However, as soon as the camera is ON... Sean switches his entire psyche from intelligent to moron. 
I am seriously impressed with how skilled he is at doing this. Unfortunately, that’s not why he’s a rich bastard.

See, I don’t really want to make things up. But other people are OBVIOUSLY doin’ that.
Sean Hannity probably has millions of reasons that he is given each year, to alter his psyche like that.

As soon as these guys know the camera is rolling, they fuckin’ totally lose track of where they are. 
They’re like infants, drooling at the mouth, the teleprompter does all of the thinking FOR them, and they 
don’t have to. 

At which point, do these men even feel like they serve any sort of purpose other than being a fuckin’ tool...? 
Probably not. Probably don’t give a shit either. They’re cool in their book, and you’re not, so fuck you, pal...

When someone says that somebody’s a lying COCKSUCKER, the term REALLY IS, rather ANCIENT.  
Probably sounds mean, but I’m actually complimenting them both. *shakes head* some people are gonna say...
"Michael, TUCKER CARLSON has millions of people who watch him.” or
“So does Sean Hannity... they couldn’t be morons if they have that much money and viewership."

Yeah, they could, actually. 
That’s when/where the magic happens. 

The only people who would suggest otherwise, might be morons themselves.
I say MIGHT be, because, it IS possible, that someone a LOT less intelligent than I am...
...may feel a need to belittle me, or insult my intelligence from time to time...
But, good luck convincing people that stick up for these guys on Fox News, it’s a lost fucking cause. 
"@)
 
$Book.AddSection(10,"Conclusion (1)",@"
It’s not a lost cause because their viewers aren’t able to be reasoned with or are idiots necessarily.
It’s not a lost cause because Carlson or Hannity are bad PEOPLE, I never said these guys were bad people at all. 

They’re probably outstanding citizens, role models (besides the fact that they fucking lie on television). 
They really should, be inducted into the fucking hall of fame for being such a consistently, top-notch,
role-model citizen. I’m not even being facetious, TUCKER CARLSON probably is a role model citizen when he’s 
nowhere near a fuckin’ camera. 

Probably tips people with a fresh `$500 bill each time he goes out to eat.
Probably sends millions of dollars to cancer research institutions. 
Probably REALLY is, a fuckin’ cool guy when he’s nowhere near that god damn camera.

But, when he spends most of his fuckin’ time near that camera, owned by Fox fuckin’ News...?
I feel myself losing IQ points listening to him TALK.
Why...? Cause that fuckin’ (coloring book/teleprompter) is feeding him BULLET POINTS.

They’re not even HIS thoughts. Any thoughts that ARE his, they probably come out AFTER he’s left for the day...
...then he’ll have to to make a voice recording of that thought.

I really think that Carlson and Hannity have these "stage personas" where...
...if they’re in front of a fuckin’ camera, AND, that camera is owned by Fox News...? 

Well, that’s not even the REAL guy you’re lookin’ at. Nah. 
It’s an actor getting paid to be a reporter. 
Or, a shell of a human being. 

That’s not fuckin’ news, bro. 
That’s performance acting, and being a professional cocksucker I might add. 
One that does an amazing job of sounding like a total moron. 
Consistently, WAY above-average, at this task.

But, probably does some really cool shit for society right after that camera goes offline.
Yeah. The brain returns, at that moment. Now they are normal people once more. 

The only reason that they deserve as such, is because they actually worked their asses off to get where 
they are. Absolutely had nothing to do with their intelligence, or their credibility... It had everything 
to do with how well they can read that (coloring book/teleprompter), and just STOP thinking for that WHOLE 
period of time. 

Obedience. Like a loyal dog sitting right next to the dinner table waiting for the family to drop scraps of
food on the floor. That's what these (2) morons do every time they pick up their paycheck from Rupert Murdock.

The problem is... PEOPLE IN AMERICAN SOCIETY ACT THIS WAY AS WELL, AND THEY CONFUSE OBEDIENCE WITH INTELLIGENCE.
They'll say stupid shit like “If you were smart, you'd be rich by now.” Like my MOTHER does.
Nah. George Carlin was smarter than either one of these dipshits and was never even that rich.

That doesn't mean that being intelligent doesn't HURT your chances at BECOMING pretty rich, but- you have to be
pretty lucky and hope to hell that people ACCEPT you or think you're a real NATURAL at SOMETHING. But- even then,
some people might become INSANELY JEALOUS about whatever you do that's considered VERY TALENTED, or whatever.

Short of that...
...people should consider that these (2) dudes on Fox News CAN certainly STILL be morons, even with all that 
money, viewership, and whatnot. For instance, let's say all that money they had... someone stole it all. 

Well, they COULD have NO CLUE, whatsoever. 
Because, as soon as they’d find out something like that...? 
Ah man, this BILLIONAIRE would REPLENISH their account again~!

They’re not rich because they’re intelligent. 
They’re rich because they’re morons that LOOK trustworthy on Fox News. 

If anybody else in the world had like, hundreds of millions of dollars stolen, it’d be gone. For good. Ain’t 
comin’ back. But, that’s why RUPERT MURDOCK is a fuckin’ force to be reckoned with, when it concerns oceans 
of cash... He’s fuckin’ got it alright. The reason why they are where they are, has nothing to do with 
intelligent thought, at all.

Actually, the opposite. Reverse psychology. TUCKER CARLSON, is actually pretty good at causing the viewer 
to feel like it’s time to be an idiot. I don’t get it. I feel bad for TUCKER CARLSON. He’s like a moth into 
the flame. People are THROWING money at him, taking advantage of his ignorance, and he’s either playing along, 
or... he really is clueless. 

What I have a serious problem with is bashing climate change scientists, and supporting the revenue streams of 
oil, gas, and car companies... That’s why they’re rich. 
Even Ted Cruz does this shit, it’s why he fantasizes about being in a hotel room with Exxon Mobil.

Bob Lutz didn’t shit his pants at GM for the entire 50 years he ran it, for nothing... 
The dude could’ve been makin’ himself useful, making good vehicles.

But, that was a little too complicated for Bob. 
Cause, at the first sign of trouble, this dude would shit his pants.

I’m sure that when he wasn’t busy shitting his pants, he was involved in slippin’ these dudes some fat stacks 
along the way. So was Exxon Mobil, and probably the Bushmeister too. It’s the only reason. Republicans aren’t 
always about things like “sensibility” or “honesty” or even “integrity”... nah. That shit is fuckin’ stupid 
to most of em... You want that shit...? Go get yourself a fuckin’ library card. And start reading from the 
non-fiction section.

If someone was willing to pay me to call these dudes morons every day, and I somehow got paid a million 
dollars a month...? I’d get better and better at it every day. It would be the best investment that person 
would ever make. Cause, I’ll fuckin’ lay into these dudes for the foreseeable future. 
It’s not like Bob Lutz from GM ever made a single car worth a damn during his 50 years running General Motors.

Nah. Bob Lutz sucked ass at making cars, never built a single car that wasn’t a piece of shit. 
While he did *ALMOST* come close to building some quality vehicles millions of times... 
...almost only counts in horseshoes and hand-grenades.
A friend of mine kept saying that to me over and over, and ever since...? It stuck.

Who cares if Bob shit his pants everyday at GM...? That habit stuck with Bob... 
50 years went by.
Thousands of pairs of underwear and pants got caked by a freshly pinched, Bob Lutz loaf... 
...while he ran a company that made millions of shitty vehicles.
You can’t even go to a PRODUCE MARKET, SUBWAY or JERSEY MIKES, to get something THAT fresh... Nah.

Does that mean Bob Lutz is a genius...? In some (peoples/morons) eyes, yeah.
Because, the man Bob Lutz could shit himself on national television, right...? 
Somehow, nobody would fuckin’ notice. 
That’s how he ran GM for 50 years. 
The man shit his pants, every day, for 50 years, now he’s a legend over at GM headquarters. 

Even Exxon Mobil was impressed, they’re like "Damn dude, that’s... some fuckin’ persistence right there...~!"

And, that dude at Exxon Mobil is right. 
That is 50 years straight, a man shitting his pants every single day, raising NO eyebrows WHATSOEVER, at GM. 

You would’ve thought maybe after a week or like a month, dude comes in at fuckin’ 9 am, has a coffee, tells some 
stupid corny jokes that no one cares for, for an hour straight... 
Oh boy, 1030 rolled around, and not long after that...? 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

GM Guy 1 : Aha. 
           There’s the look on Bob’s face... 
           I think he just shit his pants. 
           *looks at watch* 
           It is literally 1045AM, on the nose dude...
           Wow, Bob looks like he shit his pants again...
           Right on time, too.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

(^ Nobody at GM). 
Not one fuckin’ eyebrow raised for that whole 50 years bro. Nah. Dude shit his pants every single day at GM.

Sometimes Bob knew some stuff about the cars being made around the factory...
But, it’s hard for a man to give a shit about anything, in a conversation someone’s trying to have with him...
...when that man just so happens to have some fresh shit in his underwear, sticking to his ass cheeks.

Wanna know why...? 
Cause Bob shit his pants again. 
It’s nobody’s business WHY Bob shit his pants, or even WHEN.

But my god, TUCKER CARLSON doesn’t even need to shit his pants, he can just appear to have lost his train of 
thought, that’s cause his brain decided to take a shit. That might sound stupid, but it’s a theory I’ve been 
working on. 

This dude over at Fox News, the billionaire paying TUCKER CARLSON... he saw his potential when Tucker was trying 
to give a speech for the very first time at his college. Tucker lost his train of thought it wasn’t intentional 
either. 

It was at that exact moment where this man saw TUCKER CARLSON’s potential... 
"That’s it, that’s the look, right there..."

The result was that this dude realized he could put Tucker in front of a camera, and millions of people, and this 
‘unintentionally losing his train of thought’... it’d cause people to feel really bad for him. 
And, that is the QUALITY that he likes the most about him. 

So, he doesn’t respond like this, "Ah, god damnit, Tucker fuckin’ lost his train of thought again." 
He responds more like this "Yes! Tucker just lost his train of thought, doesn’t have a god damn clue~!”

Am I wrong...? Who knows. I’m not accusing anyone of being anything, but I am speculating...
...that if you’re an inconsiderate asshole that has the WHOLE world by the balls...
...you might get a kick out of being a demonic fuck face like that...
...lie to everyone’s face...?
They’ll tell themselves that there’s no fuckin’ way in hell, anyone will EVER know the truth.

However, that is what morons often think. This dude paying Tucker AND Hannity, I believe that’s what he does. 
If he doesn’t, then he’s about the dumbest motherfucker on the planet, cause that would make a LOT more sense. 
The only sense it makes to me, to pay these 2 morons to talk on Fox News, is because it makes the SAME amount of  
sense, that Bob Lutz worked at GM for 50 years, never made a single quality vehicle that entire time.

Bob did manage to help establish a shitty parts division where all of the parts are built with design flaws,
for ALL GM vehicles that were made with intentional design flaws from top to bottom. 
...while also shitting his pants at 1045 every day, and sometimes knowing what other people were working on at GM. 

That’s what Bob Lutz did the best. 
When GM got a bailout check from Obama, most of that money was for Bob to start buying some new pants. 
Obama should have asked Bob "Bob, are you gonna spend any of this money on yourself...?" 

What choice would Bob have had...? 
Lie to Obama...? 
Yeah right, bro. 
Bob never lied to ANYBODY, EVER.

Not about shitting his pants every day at about 1045, not about hanging out with his buddies at Exxon Mobil...
...plotting and scheming up ways to make GM parts even more terrible than usual... 

The man really didn’t even have to fuckin’ try, he'd just waltz right into the research and development rooms, 
and draw a fucking line anywhere he felt like on the engineering blueprints... and that shit made GM even MORE 
money somehow EACH time.     And then, they were billionaires. 

The truth is, Obama should actually make GM give back the money it borrowed, otherwise, the government will 
have to repossess ALL of those pants Bob bought... That’d be the story of a lifetime.

What an asshole, right...?"

Why did Bob spend so much money on pants...? It’s not a question that anyone ever asked. It should’ve been. 
`$3B spent on Bob Lutz wardrobe... But it’s probably because he had a habit of consistently taking a shit 
in his pants, every day. 

Sometimes, by mere accident....? Other times he’d be sitting sitting there getting work done, and he’d feel the 
__________________________ 
| bowel movement of doom | 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
He would try to get up and run sometimes, but then he got to a point in his life where sometimes...
...he just sat there and waited... rather than doing anything about it. 

He probably liked the sensation of his warm shit coming out in his underwear, against the his chair. 
Probably even stated out loud 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Lutz : Whatever bro. 
       Guess I’m shittin’ in my pants again. 
       Oh well.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I don’t fuckin’ get it, man. 
NOBODY NOTICED THIS. I think that maybe people DID notice, but there’s a rather sinister explanation for it.

The same quality of thought goes into Tucker being in front of a camera. 
Nobody ever stops and says "Why is this idiot always on Fox News...?" 
It’s not a question people ever ask, even though they should. Wanna know why...? 

Cause I would be willing to bet, that Fox News, could go to any school in America, pick any random kid at all... 
ask that random kid, "HEY KID, WANNA STAR IN YOUR OWN SHOW AND BE A MILLIONAIRE...?" Obviously kid says “Yeh.”
Then, people would then and there, have an legitimate reason, to watch Fox News again, so the ratings will change. 
Some kid that nobody even knows, will probably sound like Albert Einstein compared to TUCKER CARLSON.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Person1 : Yeah, there’s some new kid on Fox News?
Person2 : Yup. Just some random kid too.
Person1 : This kid sounds REALLY smart~!

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

The kid was in second grade though. Ya know...? Ratings soared because this kid sounded like the guy from 
Big Bang Theory, Sheldon. The reality is... the reason this kid SOUNDED like Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory, 
isn’t because he was actually a gifted kid, he was just some random kid from a random school, and therefore,         
automatically more comprehensive to listen to, then TUCKER CARLSON. That kid, would be a smash hit on Fox News, 
I do not doubt it.

I’m starting to think that Tucker KNOWS that he didn’t get where he is for his intelligence. 
Quite the opposite, believe it or not. Maybe sometimes he goes home, cries himself to sleep, and that’s 
fine... It would cause me to have some empathy for him. If a random second grader somehow impresses everybody 
on the network, and you’re TUCKER CARLSON, who has the highest ratings in the industry (somehow), well, 
HOLY FUCK.

I’m not trying to make him feel like he’s not valued as a human being... 
Cause he most certainly IS valued as a human being... cause ... he’s fuckin’ paid `$100M a year. 
That’s insanity. So is Sean Hannity. Just, not valued in a way where anything spoken by him on a 
Fox News broadcast, is given a shred of credibility.
Wanna know why...? Fox News, could change it’s name to Not News...
__________________________________________________________________________________
| Used to be News...? Now we’re not news. Not News. Part of the Not News Network |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Not news. 
Not something that any person on earth, should ever fuckin’ take seriously, or even casually confuse what they’re     
being told, as "news".
With a name like Not News, you know what you’re dealing with. 
It’s not fuckin’ news. 
More specifically, it’s Not News.
Sons of bitches will try to say "Keeping you up to date, every hour, on the hour, Not News Network" and anybody who’s
even half asleep, they’re gonna think "Why...?"

That’s my only problem. If I had billions of dollars, I would literally throw as much as I could, 
at NBC or CNN, to continue undermining Fox’s credibility.

It shouldn’t be that difficult. 
These guys do that shit to themselves sometimes. 
Carlson: Hey everybody, what is critical race theory...? I don’t know what it is, what does it even matter? Huh?

I can’t recall specific examples of this dude, making a god damn fool of himself, because I’ve gotten 
to a point where I have to leave the room whenever I see his face, or hear his voice, sometimes I might 
even start yelling at the top of my lungs because ... I can’t stand the fuckin’ guy. It’s like a panic 
attack but only happens when I’m just ANNOYED. (← I’m exaggerating)

Hannity is just as bad, though, I can actually tolerate like 30 more seconds... that’s it though.
Fuckin’ pretentious prick that literally stated hundreds of thousands of times, that climate change is made up. 
Figment of the imagination... Doesn’t exist. Can’t happen. Impossible... 
He was being handed `$100M to say those     things. 

Oh, I remember the documentary, 2016 Before the Flood, Ted Cruz, makin’ a fuckin’ fool of himself too. 
The truth is, the earth’s a metaphor for the Titanic and I think cause of guys like these morons, 
we’re basically fucked. In the beginning of the documentary, Dicaprio talks about the painting, 
“The Garden of Earthly Delights”

It is basically foreshadowing the future. Hannity, and Carlson, they’re fuckin’ morons and they have a 
lot more people that care about the shit they say, and they’re rich. The world as ass backwards, and we 
probably deserve to go extinct... I don’t really hope that happens, but I think it is probably TOO LATE 
to fix the damage we have caused collectively. Therefore, inevitably, the world will experience a 
catastrophic event, where everything ceases to exist.

Literally because of morons. Everywhere, someone SAYS (1st) thing, but they DO (2nd) thing.
When you think about it...? Having this mentality makes a lot of sense. Makes a lot more sense than thinking 
the human race will ever get a grip on itself... For sure.

Then again...? Maybe, thinking about the worst case scenario day in, and day out... is the thing that 
motivates guys like Elon Musk. Doesn’t let the REALITY get to him. 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Musk : Yeah, the world is full of morons Michael Cook. 
       Oh well. 
       Do something positive and don’t be so negative.
Cook : Well, what the hell, not tryin’ to be. 
       Look at you, ya successful bastard.
Musk : You think this was easy...?
Cook : Nope. 
       Not at all.
Musk : *shakes his head* Ya know, you shouldn’t be so hard on Bob Lutz. 
       Yeah. 
       Maybe he didn’t make a single good EV.
       So what, Mike...?
Cook : He should’ve.
Musk : Yeah, well, could’ve, should’ve, would’ve... 
       If I had a dollar for every time I heard that-
Cook : You’d be a trillionaire, huh?
Musk : Well, I was thinking more like a quadrillionaire...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Cause, I can imagine how Jesus felt, when a bunch of morons nailed him to a cross, and then burned him at 
the stake, but the reason that they chose to do that, is because... People are fuckin’ morons.

Yeah. I’m no exception, I’m not the smartest person in the world. But sometimes the reality settles in, 
and the sun goes down... the moon gets to the top of the sky... and I say to myself, this is really all 
that’s gonna happen, isn’t it?

There’s no fuckin’ point in doing a god damn thing, when some moron like TUCKER CARLSON...
...is handed `$100M a year, to sound like the dumbest motherfucker that ever lived.
There might be a point, but if that dude can literally get paid to just be an idiot every day... 
what difference can     I make...? Dude probably shits gold nuggets and wipes his ass with `$500 bills. 
Nobody cares.

Only, heh. He’s not as dumb as he thinks he is. 
Maybe he could be convinced, to pressure them into changing the name of their network from FOX NEWS, to 
NOT NEWS... Then, the war would be over. 
No more feeling a need to ruminate on some moron that needs a coloring book for a ‘teleprompter’. 
Oh yeah, he knows the definition to a lot of words alright, by SOUND. Not by reading them.

At least in Sean Hannity’s case, he can actually help the situation he’s in. 
Bob Lutz couldn’t help himself, cause he had no control over his bowel movements... 
At any given moment, dude would get the Hershey squirts, acting like it was a total surprise... 
"Ah fuck... not again~!" 

I think that after he said "Ah fuck, not again" after like 20 years...? He wasn’t fooling anybody anymore. Nah. 
That man, shitting his pants every god damn day, was the thing that was the most consistently, high-quality 
thing on his GM resume, over the course of his 50 years at GM. 

You’d think Bob Lutz running GM for 50 years, his specialties were 1) building vehicles, and 2) crushing souls... 
but no. More like 1) eatin’ beans, and 2) soiling jeans.

Cars...? That came dead last, because he never did that at all. 
So, someone started chuckling because they heard what I had to say, they know this dude who owns Fox News.

They finally asked that dude if these things I was saying, happened to be true... and this guy?     
If he’s honest with anybody at all, he will say "Fuck yeah, dude."
Because NOBODY has actually caught onto this dude’s plan. 
So far, he’s fucked with everybody, not (1) single person has caught onto this fuckin’ game he’s playing. 
The game being, "Everyone watching these morons, not questioning why they’re on the platform, 
soaking up viewership..."

If you’re a billionaire, and you’re fuckin’ bored because you can practically do whatever the hell you want...?
You’ll probably start throwing stacks of money at people, just to watch them make complete fools of themselves.

Like, "Drink this syrup of ipecac for `$100." *guy drinks it* "Ah man, it’s not THAT bad, tastes like pine 
tree syrup." 
Then suddenly, this dude is just spewing vomit all over the sidewalk. Some people are morons like that. 
They will go ahead, drink something they have no fuckin’ clue is POISON, gonna kill them at all, but hey... 
...dude offered ya `$100 bucks, can’t be THAT bad, right...? 

Well, think again, ya fuck. 
That was a terrible idea, wasn’t it? Guy would probably agree if he could stop puking, and does so for 
several minutes. Then the guy offers him another `$100 to lick it. Didn’t wanna do it cause of how degrading 
it was...? But then hey... dude goes right ahead an does it. Basically the same thought process Hannity has 
with Murdock.

When I see TUCKER CARLSON on TV, I get the feeling it’s just some sick fuckin’ joke somebody is playing 
somewhere... I don’t even ask anybody, because who the fuck even knows? Ya know...? So, I write these 
things to touch on the comedic side of what those thoughts lead to, because... I’m a pragmatist. 
If I had billions of dollars and wanted to do something different, I know what I’d do. 
I’d fuck with people to no end... but not like Carlson does. Even still, only if I couldn’t 
find anything productive to do, which would be pretty fuckin’ difficult... cause there’s plenty 
of productive shit to do.

The productive things would prevent me from doing the stupid shit that I would say with my dark comedy.

When I see things like "Hannity tells climate change scientists that they suck ass at being scientists"...
...I am immediately floored by that notion, sarcastically. Because, HE said so. Whatever this dude says...?
Oh shit...! That means it’s fuckin’ real...~! Hannity. Said some shit that everyone will probably believe...

This dude could lazily drag his whole body onto an iceberg, naked... 
And he could tell people he’s in some safari in Africa. 
People will fuckin’ believe him. 
They won’t even ask him what the hell is he doing buck naked on a friggen iceberg. Nah. 
Dude’s in a safari in Africa. 
Why? Cause. No reason even needed. 
He is handed millions of dollars, and he thinks it’s because his work is high quality... 
...and his work IS considered high quality...
...just not the work he thinks is being considered high quality... nah.

The quality work Hannity is doing, is not impressing anybody like me, that’s for fuckin’ sure.
It really is hard for me to consider, a worse offender in the media, then either one of these dipshits.

What I mean is that Sean doesn’t know ANYTHING with ANY degree of certainty if he’s getting `$100M to say:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Hannity : Fuck everybody... climate change isn’t happening.
          If 20 hurricanes happen this year and wipe out 30 million people...
          Yeah right, you idiots trying to blame your quote unquote “climate change”
          C’mon... 
          You guys are being wicked dramatic. 
          You’ve been sayin’ that shit for the last 20 years now... 
          Grow up.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Sean won’t realize it, but some people started taking a tally of all the times this dude openly lies in a 
broadcast. Guys like Lester Holt don’t have a fuckin’ thing to worry about, but guys like Sean Hannity 
sure as hell do. I’m not saying that to be an implication that I will be involved in that scenario in 
the least. Nope. But some people are gonna get pissed at this dude, if they aren’t already.

It comes down to this... Usually when people want to be trusted...? 
They should at the very least, make an effort to not sound like a total fuckin’ moron.
Some people can’t help it though. Fox News does the opposite. 
They actually work so god damn hard, at trying to throw people off course...
...OR... 
...they’ll perform the equivalent of SAYING "Fuck off already~!", or "Leave me the fuck alone~!"
But- people just don’t do that, do they?
They should literally say those things in a broadcast, just to CHECK, if maybe they have a lot of reverse
psychology... goin’ on.

You know, maybe they could tell some hot girl, “You really shouldn’t choke a big fat D, even if it’s mine.”
...and just see if she fuckin’ tries, man.

Maybe a girl will actually be confused and then inquire why you would say something like that...
...and advance.
I think that is exactly what’s happening to Fox News.

Fox does not want to be seen as trustworthy... but- people trust them anyway.
They don’t really fuckin’ know why. 
They’re trying their best to be assholes, and people just seem to be more and more interested...
...in how they wax their ass hairs as nicely as they do.

They will make something Donald Trump did that was pretty fuckin’ bad after all, and start saying:

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Them: Oh yeah... Donald Trump did some shit he wasn’t supposed to do...?!?
      Well, he’s the best president that ever lived, so... 
      ...these people are OBVIOUSLY psychotic and have mental issues.
      Yeah, a president would never have a speech outside of the capital and incite an insurrection...
      You people oughtta be ashamed of yourselves~!

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Then the next day they’re trying not to talk about the elephant in the room... 
Every day on Fox and Friends “Trump this”, “Trump that”, but on January 7th 2021...? 
They were basically dead quiet. *crickets chirping* 
The minions. 
They’re a fuckin’ problem. 
When I saw on Fox News that the FBI was raiding Mrs. Clinton’s home, I was like: 
"Cool. She’s getting arrested...?" 

I would later find out, "Nah dipshit. She’s too COOL to get in trouble. So, fuck you..." Yeah. 
I did say something along those lines to myself... and I have ever since too.

Anyway, I didn’t realize that people could be too cool to get in trouble for shit. WAY too cool. 
I’m probably using the wrong word by the way. 
The way I see it is like THIS... 
...who gives a shit about the truth, the minions, do not seem to actually care. Oh well.

I have to consider, that some people really don’t fuckin’ know any better. 
Then, those people, when I tell them “Maybe you don’t know any better...”
...they begin to act like I’m fuckin’ insane. 
So, it doesn’t help for me to interact with people, because...? 

If I tell someone the TRUTH, they may not believe me, OR, they’ll just be wicked upset and say “not MY president”...
...and just storm out of the room and shit. Like a kid just got their ass kicked at a video game.

Or, they’ll tell me they do NOT believe me, they just start wrapping things in air quotes...
...and I detect that stuff very easily. Yeah, wrapping things with “air quotes” in a conversation is gonna fuckin...
...aggravate the fuck out of someone like me man, cause then it sounds like a “hypothetical” thing.

It’s like I could tell some dude who starts doing that, “Hey, what if I like fuck your ‘wife’ or ‘girlfriend’?”
Well, this person might actually think I’m NOT being fuckin’ serious. Depends...
Not gonna just say that to whoever... 
...unless they’re like making statements I say sound like a “hypothetical” fuckin’ situation. 
Yeah, it’s a lot like when FBI Investigator Chris Voss had his MasterClass and says 
“Mirroring”, you just... say the last 3 fuckin’ words somebody said...? 
And, You’ll be a fuckin pro in no time.

But- smart bastards like me immediately detect stuff like that. And when I say, IMMEDIATELY, I mean, 
I notice it the FIRST time, and it didn’t really slip by me. Then the SECOND time... and I already 
know you’re using that strategy. This is what Shelley Zeitske was doing to me *checks watch* about 
a year ago. 

Whatever. People do that shit, it doesn’t work on people like me, cause it doesn’t.

It’s not a consistent case where people don’t believe what I’ve got to say, but when I detect the fuckin’ 
“air quotes“, or the mirroring... it’s gonna piss me off immediately and appear to be a sign of disrespect. 
Doesn’t necessarily mean that, but I’m pretty fuckin attentive to details. People... might not realize 
that I’m not an absent minded person at all.

Now, if I LIE to somebody, they may actually think I just told them the truth. It is a little too easy for 
me to do this. I think that’s why I encounter so much resistance, most people lie. I am pretty sure that’s 
why I get so much flak. If most people lie, it’s because that’s the easy thing... they haven’t developed a 
capability to do the DIFFICULT thing, of where they tell the truth... so, if I’ll be perfectly honest, it’s 
WAY too fucking easy and I don’t like to do it in conversations with people. Really ever.

But if I do... and I casually lie to someone without any effort, that person might say “I believe you. 
You really I shouldn’t lie like you were doing the last time...” which is strange, because when someone 
says that to you when you were actually telling the truth, Ah. That’s why I start getting really pissed 
off with people.

I WASN’T lying *at all*, I was telling that motherfucker the truth. People might think I’m exaggerating, 
I’m really not. I do get pretty fuckin’ frustrated when I tell people the truth and they don’t believe me, 
but if I start lying or EVEN sounding FACETIOUS... “Oh. Alright then, that is believable.”

So, like WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.

I’ve lost my cool with people because I expect that people are going to trust a guy like Dwayne Coonradt, 
over me. Why? I think it’s because he’s a lying sack of shit that has no integrity and doesn’t give a flying 
fuck. 

But also, I really wish I was able to get that video of these (2) dudes following me, off of the phone.

I haven’t made an example out of the (2) 25-30 year old white males that attempted to kill me outside of 
Computer Answers and probably had something to do with CVE-2019-8936.

As for Dwayne, oh well dude. It isn’t because he knows how to do the job better or as well as I do. 
It’s because he is an asshole, and a lot of people are stupid, and they like him, and trust him. 
Why...? Cause the man is actually not very intelligent.

If people really like Fox News, it might be because they don’t know of any other news source. 
Maybe in certain areas, that’s all that’s out there.
Fox News: The only name in news. (<- that’s a joke right there, but it’s not funny anymore)

Even Bob Lutz from GM, shitting his pants ... nevermind that still makes me laugh.
Nah, Fox news isn’t news, it’s fuckin’... the rhetoric of tribesman. 

There’s a general distinction between ACTUAL news organizations like 1) NBC, 2) ABC, 3) CBS, 4) CNN, 
and those distinctions are, that if I watch an opinion piece, it’s not a show that focuses on a 
particular female being in the room and then some dude does most of the talking or work, it’s really 
a collaboration. Although I will say this, Hallie Jackson is pretty hot. And has her own show.

With Fox, it’s all forced narratives, TUCKER CARLSON going on some rant about how he went through puberty, 
how traumatic it was, is a story I’m gonna give (0) shits about. But, that’s really what that channel consists of.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Carlson : Was I supposed to start shaving my pubes when I was 15...? 
          Cause then the red bumps came, then it was VERY itchy...
          For like, weeks bro... 
          I couldn’t tell my mother cause that would be WEIRD, but- 
          Eventually, *I* Tucker god damn Carlson, fuckin’ survived. 
          I persevered. 
          Wanna know why?
          Because I’ll ask myself a billion questions that paint a very clear picture...
          ...that I don’t know how to perform skillful rhetoric at all. 
          Just, ask one question? 
          Ask another. 
          Ask a third that sorta takes the last two questions I asked, and give em the middle fuckin’ finger...
          ...cause NOW I’m askin’ a SUPER cool question, and this question is no joke... 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

The point is, I framed the rhetoric in that skit so that he didn’t ask a single fuckin’ question that didn’t 
sound all that moronic... as there was NO information to be gained from any of those questions, even if they 
were just stand in characters. Sometimes TUCKER CARLSON does that, he’ll ask a question where he doesn’t give 
a shit about the answer at all, he’s just asking it to buffer things out and sound more bombastic. 
The guy who owns Fox, even he’s fuckin’ clueless too. 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Murdock : *gritty voice* Why do people even watch us...? 
          It’s like we are literally TRYING to NOT be liked, but then the opposite thing happens. 
          What the actual fuck, bro.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

I would genuinely feel bad TUCKER CARLSON suddenly started bawling his eyes out...
…on national television after being told the truth. 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Carlson : *starts crying* I’ve put EVERYTHING on the line for *points at Murdock* YOU Rupert!
Murdock : *sighs* C’mon Tucker, don’t cry, dude... 
          Here, let me give ya a hug...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Then, the two hug it out on national television. 
Fox News happens to be ACTUAL NEWS for that brief moment

_____________________________________________________________________________________
| Headline : Carlson cries like a bitch for a minute, Murdock hugs him like his dad |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Carlson : *eyes bloodshot and tears running down his face*
          *sniffle* You were always like a father to me...
Murdock : Ugh, Tucker, please never say that shit to me ever again...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

At which point, everyone feels bad for TUCKER CARLSON... 
Cause, he considers that man to be like a father to him, and Tucker doesn’t understand...
…Murdock doesn’t like when people get too close. 
While RUPERT MURDOCK WAS willing to fill the shoes of the father he never had...
...Tucker doesn’t realize that Murdock doesn’t give a rats ass about Tucker...
...cause that’s why he pays him money to do a job.

Probably does sound rather fuckin’ cold to deliver that skit like that... but, I really cannot think of 
anything compelling enough that would cause me to think otherwise. I mean, he is a fuckin’ grown-ass man 
after all...

Someone might say "Why do you feel bad for a MILLIONAIRE, he’s a lot better off than you are..."
My response...? 
I really don’t think so at all. 
That man, would probably be so lost if he didn’t have Fox News in his life... 

I think he could be better than what he is, if he made an effort to cut the fuckin’ bullshit, and then I’d 
have a reason to respect him. As it stands...? That doesn’t seem very likely.

What would he do with himself if he woke up one day and realized "I need to have integrity from here forward..."
That mentality wouldn’t be welcome at Fox News, that’s for damn sure. 

Fox News is everything to him. 
When that man wakes up? “Oh yeah, Fox fuckin’ News bro. All day...? Every day.”
When he goes to sleep, he dreams about it... crushing it, trying to get that square peg through the round hole...
Doesn’t matter if it’s actual news, or not news. 

What matters is that Fox tries to look a lot like a REAL NEWS network...
...but then dicks start flying into people’s mouths from off screen...
...cause some fuckin’ facts got intercepted and amended immediately.

But, because it LOOKS like an actual NEWS organization all the time to so many people, that’s what really 
counts. Fox News is literally Tuckers one and only true home, and if he had to leave...?

What the fuck would this man do...?
Where would he go...?
What would his purpose be...?
Is he gonna CHANGE his ways and say 
“You know what...? Climate change is actually real after all folks...”, 
“I know, I know, I’ve got fuckin’ hundreds of millions of dollars, but the REAL villain, is climate change.”
Nah. ^ Everyone’s gonna say “Fuck you bro.”

The man would feel empty inside. Spent his whole fuckin’ life, asking questions, searching for answers...
Dude drove over mountain, and plain, and into every valley and city... in search for a way to make a god 
damn name for himself. Now he’s everywhere. Then, RUPERT MURDOCK, with his briefcase in hand, saw this 
kid look like a total hopeless idiot, and somehow realized. 
"That’s the fuckin’ look of a millionaire right there."

If people understood what I’m saying here, Tucker wouldn’t last very long without Fox News. 
He runs shit at Fox News and could tell Murdock to suck HIS dick, Murdock might actually do it. 
But Carlson would never ask him to do that, pretty sure.

Regardless... Tucker would probably find out, that everyone always thought something was off about him... 
They weren’t watching him because he was reporting the news...? Nah. 
They watched him because people felt better about themselves when they watched this poor man think out loud.

People first saw TUCKER CARLSON, and they immediately were drawn to him.
Because, he looked like the type of dude who could cause people confusion...
...appear to be so genuinely lost within his own thoughts...
...while also saying sentences that sound like maybe he IS thinking *something* after all... Yeah. 
That’s because, if someone can make up some bullshit on the fly...? It’s him.

$Book.AddSection(10,"Skit [~] Tucker and Bob’s golf match",@"
Tucker took inspiration from Bob Lutz...
He kept talking shit to this old man, about his golf game. 
He had no fuckin’ clue whether he played golf or not, but he felt like bothering *somebody*.
Bob obliged, and they set a date to play golf.

Anyway, when that day came, Tucker paid his buddy `$500 to destroy Bob Lutz, at golf. 
Bob got pissed off when he found out that Tucker wasn’t playing...
...everybody does.
But, Bob shook on the game, and talked with Tucker anyway. 
It was an interesting experience where they got to know each other a little better.
Bob talked about GM, his 50 year legacy, and Tucker just asked a lot of questions.

While Tucker walked around with Bob, he would talk shit to Bob after *every* swing, sometimes right in the 
*middle* of the swing, annoying him for that whole day... 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Carlson : Bob, how did you manage to shit your pants everyday at the same time, for 50 years straight...?
          People at GM didn’t think that was weird at all, or anything?
Bob     : I wasn’t actually shittin’ my pants, dude. *wink*
Carlson : *confused* But, that’s... what they told me...?
Bob     : As long as I was able to convince MYSELF, that I didn’t just shit my pants...?
Bob     : Then I’d use my position and facial expressions to look at people a certain way.
Bob     : So, if I had ANY suspicion at all...
          that they were about to ask me what I THOUGHT they were about to ask me...
Bob     : I had to give people that look. 
          Then, that person KNEW it’d be pretty fuckin’ stupid...
          ...to ask me if I just shit my pants. 
          And, it worked. 
          Sometimes I would pretend they asked me anyway to get inside their heads...
          "You listen here motherfucker, did you just ask me, if I shit my pants just now...?" I’d say.
          "No sir, I’d never ask you that..." they’d say.
          "I wear to fuckin’ god, if I ever hear you ask me that question again...?”
          “I will fuckin’ fire your ass, you understand...?" I’d say.
          Oh, I got inside everybody’s head Tuck. 
          Whenever a new person came around and asked...? 
          I’d say the same thing. 
          These people knew not to ask me some question like that, cause, even if I did Tucker...?
          *Looks at Tucker* Tucker...
Carlson : *looks at Bob* 
Bob     : These people knew that I could literally shit my pants right in front of them... 
          ...and then not do a god damn thing for the rest of the day. 
Bob     : Nobody could do anything to stop me from doin’ that.
Carlson : *confused look* Why would you keep shitting your pants though, I don’t get it...
Bob     : You think I did that intentionally...? 

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Tucker didn’t realize, Bob wasn’t shitting his pants intentionally at all. 
He had maybe about a 30 second window where he better get his ass to the bathroom, or, 
Hershey squirts... all over the place.
Done for the day...? 
Doing the waddle of shame. Cause, Bob probably had a routine, every single day, 9AM.
He got there at 830, because he likes to be early for the day, shows everyone that he’s an early riser, 
and a go getter. Bob was consistent about that, and by 9? 

Well, Bob actually did some work after all. He signed stuff. Wrote some checks. 
Wrote letters to people that said "I’m the guy who runs GM, suck a fuckin’ dick, bro." 
Some people who actually write back and say "Sorry for having an attitude." 
Bob would say "You better fuckin’ be sorry for havin’ an attitude with me...” 
...and then Bob would just walk around the office. 
He’d pretend to look like he was busy, ate some breakfast with some coffee. 
Looked out the factory window, sometimes he’d speak to people on the floor. 
When he did, he would amp the shit out of them by staying the 2 words mattered the most to him...

Bob would walk up to the factory workers 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Bob  : Hey fellas.
Guys : Hey Bob!
Bob  : I want you to say the 2 words that best describe this company, the first word being "Low".
       *They would ALL try to interrupt each other*
Guys : OOOO! I know! I know! "Quality!".
Bob  : That’s right son. 
       Would we even be General Motors if it were anything else?
Guys : Hell no sir.
Bob  : *puts his sunglasses on* Damn straight fellas.  

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Tucker was impressed by Bob’s story.
The guy Tucker paid to play golf for him actually beat Bob.

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Carlson : I beat you Bob. 
Bob     : Kid, you didn’t swing a single god damn ball...
Carlson : I know, but I just paid that guy to play you, and he won. 
          That means I won...
Bob     : *stern face* You listen here kid... 
          I was about to give you some words of advice, but not if you’re gonna tell me I just fuckin’ lost to you...      
          You didn’t play the damn game, that dude did.
Carlson : Bob, I can respect a man that might’ve shit his pants every day for 50 years...
          …when he ran one of the biggest companies in the world. 
          But if you’re about to pull some shady shit with me right now after losing to me...? 
          Well... 
          I’m afraid I’m not gonna be too happy about that...
Bob     : *pissed* Kid, do you even realize how stupid you look on TV...?
Carlson : *looks away for a moment, Bob has a good point, looks back at Bob*
          You know Bob, you were one of my idols when I was growing up.
Bob     : *shocked look on face, caught off guard*
Carlson : Just like my mother always told me, ‘You cant win em all’.

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
      
Those words caused Bob to feel truly terrible for callin’ him stupid looking on TV. 

/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

Bob     : That’s what my buddies used to tell me... 
          ...“Cant win em all, Bob... 
          ...might as well throw your pants in the trash, and buy new ones."
Carlson : *looks at Bob* Yeah see, I have never once shit my pants on Fox News. 
          Not once Bob. 
          Never even lost to you in golf either. 
Bob     : Well kid, you didn’t play the god damn game. 
          Besides, you know that Fox News isn’t a news company... right?
Carlson : Frankly, I don’t even care. 
          Sometimes we’re newsy...?
          Sometimes we’re not. 
          Sometimes we get it wrong. 
          Do we admit to it? 
          Never. 
          That’s the life that I was born for Bob... 
          Not only have I never shit my pants on life television...? 
          But I’ve also never lost in a game of golf...
          ...and I sure as hell am not gonna stand for some dude who shit his pants...
          ...for 50 years straight at GM headquarters...
          ...tell me that I look fuckin’ stupid on TV. 
          Fuck you, Bob. 
          You owe me an apology...

\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

Of course, Bob had no intention of apologizing to this kid, cause he fuckin’ rick rolled him right into a 
game of golf he didn’t even play. That’s just how (2) manipulators at the top of their game, managed to 
coincide in a story where Carlson doesn’t have to play a single game of golf, to say enough shit to people... 
that they would shake his hand and play a game against some totally different person.
"@)

$Book.AddSection(10,"Conclusion (2)",@"
That’s because, if there is something this dude knows how to do, it’s to manipulate people, for sure.
That’s what this dude gets `$100M+ for, per yer, if not more, and RUPERT MURDOCK is happy to give him 
whatever he wants. What can anybody do about it?

He’s supposedly got the best ratings in the industry, because people don’t really like the idea of thinking 
for themselves. That’s the gods honest truth, they want someone ELSE to think FOR them, rather than for THEM 
to think for themselves. So, by taking advantage of people that cannot think for themselves, they can 
continue to manipulate people that aren’t going to give a flying fuck about climate change, and therefore, 
they’re basically like a battery.

Not unlike in the movie the Matrix, the “Desert of the real”, yeah. That’s our future. Everybody’s plugged 
into the Matrix, that watches him. Nobody is going to outdo Tucker fuckin’ Carlson at a game he’s basically 
taken to the next level. Wanna know why...? Well, it’s not cause he’s a real smart bastard, that’s for sure. 
He’s not an idiot either, but if someone’s gonna tell me that dude is smart as a fuckin’ whip, uh-uh. 
I don’t fuckin’ think so.

However, he IS pretty good at manipulating people, the two skills or attributes are not the same. 
On one hand, someone can egregiously whip their dick out, shove it into a blender, and then turn it on, 
and whatever, they just fuckin’ threw their dick in a blender, oh well... shit happens. 
Probably sounds fuckin’ stupid, doesn’t it? 

Well, that’s the point.

On the other hand, being an intellectual causes people to have to work their brain muscle a little bit more, 
there is no brain muscle, it requires effort, people don’t like to APPLY much effort in order to make 
their own determinations. So, theoretically, if you can just bullshit a lot of people, then you will be 
a god damn leader, for sure.

That’s a fucking SERIOUS problem.

Greetings (Reddit) PowerShell Community,

Over the last month and a half, I've been slowly working on a utility that implements a combination of 
PowerShell class structures, (XAML/Extensible Application Markup Language), Multithreading & PowerShell Runspaces 
that can automatically throttle itself and synchronize the window with the GUI dispatcher, but that is a rather
complicated project to try and dive into without the utility being complete and testing well.

The link to it is listed in Overview (2).
I'll talk about it briefly and then begin this explanation into building class structures in PowerShell, 
and how to translate an existing series of variables into a class.

Last night I decided to take a break from the threading stuff, and dive into the topic of converting scripts to 
.Net class types. I then wrote this lesson plan

But as I wrote this lesson plan, and then I realized that the TANGENTS I later go on in this 
lesson plan REQUIRED SOME SERIOUS EXPANSION. 

Thus, I started to write this 685 page book...

...and teach people WHY classes are really... incredibly USEFUL and UNDERUSED. 
If people only knew that I look for ways to turn C# code into PowerShell code... 

Sometimes it's possible. 
Sometimes it's not, without a lot of ADDITIONAL code.

In (C#/CSharp), classes are definitely not underused at all. In PowerShell, they definitely are.

Now, I've tried to teach some people in the community before about how to write classes in PowerShell, as it isn't 
exactly an intuitive process. But, I figured this one HERE is unlike any other lesson plan I've done before.

Nah. 
This one right here...? 
It's pretty long and detailed, but I'm certain it'll be a fun read.

Anyway, this lesson plan starts from an idea like:
__________________________________________
| Get-WMIObject -ClassName Win32_Product |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
...and then building a custom class off of THAT.

Not just writing a class off of it either, but- if an issue crops up, then pivot to an alternate strategy, and 
continue on. Not saying "Wow. What I need to do is too much work..."

Cause I'm here to take some COMPLICATED SUBJECTS, and make em' simple, writing a tutorial on how to build yourself 
a class that can produce OTHER class templates and stuff... with some story elements thrown in along the way. 

This one may not necessarily have an associated video, but- it will probably cause a few people to chuckle and even 
draw up comparisons between how they CURRENTLY write their code, and what the benefits may be to going all out with a
full-blown, class structure approach that can be pipelined by functions, or CmdLetBindings.

Anyway, the event log utility I've been working on, its no joke.
It does a lot more than just collect event logs- the utility has a fully featured graphical user interface that I 
teased about in the lesson plan I wrote about a month and a half ago... but because this process is extremely 
lengthy (Not News is … hundreds of times longer). 

I've had to adopt a methodology to implement a way to dynamically (allocate/adjust) running thread counts.
I call it AUTOTHREADING, but it's probably just a fancy word for automatic multithreading.

The lesson plan I wrote for it about a month and a half ago...? Could've been about anything.
But, as it took longer and longer to run through it, I realized that I had to find a way to implement something 
VERY COMPLICATED into a utility that is dead simple.

So, I decided to hold off on completing and distributing that lesson plan, because I kept making changes to the code. 
Just like SpaceX made so many changes to the BFR along the years...

I can imagine that when building PayPal, Elon didn't mess around.
You wanna pay a pal of yours over the internet...? Well, now you can.
Wanna know why you can pay a pal over the internet now...?
Cause some smart guys thought of a way to do it. Elon was one of those guys. 

Prolly the main guy involved, in the inception of the world's first pal-paying-program, PayPal.

While what I'm doing isn't as COOL as PayPal, or mankinds' first reflyable 25-story building...
...it uses SYNCHRONIZED HASHTABLES, CLASSES, SESSION STATE OBJECTS, FUNCTION/ASSEMBLY/VARIABLE entries, BOTH runspace 
factories, separate objects to control groups of threads, sends progress information to the GUI console, stopwatch,
timing, reports, percentage of completion, passes stuff back and forth, handles hundreds of thousands of event logs, 
uses native System.IO.Compression classes, has a lot of error handling, and it really is all coordinated from the 
controller classes that drive the GUI.

Here's a link to the functions on my GitHub project... https://github.com/mcc85s/Functions
I uploaded VARIOUS versions of the file/process, EventLog-Utility.ps1, or some variation of that.

This is the NEWEST VERSION of it...
https://github.com/mcc85s/FightingEntropy/blob/main/Functions/EventLogs-UtilityRunspaces-v4.ps1

Various versions because I tried hundreds of ways to make the process FASTER or MORE EFFICENT.
The tool is meant to essentially EXPORT the LOGS and SYSTEM DETAILS, and then SAVE to an ARCHIVE.

Then, the tool can LOAD one of those ARCHIVES and be able to REVIEW the EVENT LOGS from another system.

Ultimately, the program extracts all of the event logs from a system and automatically calculates how many threads
it can use, and divides the work accordingly, to process everything in a PARALLEL manner, though it is NOT COMPLETE.

I suppose the most complicated thing about what I'm doing, is trying to do all of this from the
GUI, without causing the dispatcher thread to lock up. The end result, looking sorta like Rufus.

But, strategically assigning properties and values at specific a (location/time), is stressful.
Like, "balancing a broomhandle in a hurricane", probably took a while to figure out.
Probably didn't happen overnight. Wonder who would've said something that 'insane'...

Yeah. Some people used to think that "balancing a broomhandle in a hurricane" was impossible.
And, as people heard something that sounded impossible, being stated by a real smart bastard,
they would constantly confuse that person's intellect, with insanity.

They rarely ever realize that doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different
results, is the definition of insanity. The DIFFERENCE between the two, is "strategy".

As for the things I mentioned a few paragraphs up, there are some examples in the community that exhibit PORTIONS of 
what I'm attempting to do. Jim Moyle has a couple of good XAML/Runspace videos and his work is good, but it's a few 
years old now. I'd be interested in seeing Jim do more of those videos, to be perfectly honest.

But also, who would be surprised that I'd say Boe Prox (...in addition to 1RedOne).
1RedOne has a sample that looks very close to what I am attempting to do.

But, Jim's exhibition and Boe/1RedOne's have a similar issue.
They're calling a new runspace within a scripted runspace.
I'm doing something totally different.

Boe has plenty of work out there in the wild, such as PoshRSJobs (very useful module btw).
But I've run into many limitations with it, and had no idea how to troubleshoot them.

In reference to a veteran MVP's work like his...? I'm not gonna try to reinvent the wheel.
But, I did keep runspaces in the back of my mind as I kept thinking about reinventing the:

$Book.AddSection(11,"Can't just go reinventing stuff",@"
It is one of the most challenging tasks I've ever decided to take on. The takeaway will be that I found a way to 
integrate the threading of multiple runspaces via many custom classes that I wrote to drive the backend of the 
utility. It is rather thorough in the information it collects, and it formats itself and saves a running system
configuration and ALL event logs to a .zip file that the program never actually decompresses. 

Sorta like JOHN CARMACK decided to do with Quake III Arena by using (*.PK3) files.

If you don't know who JOHN CARMACK is, or what a (*.PK3) file is, well...
- JOHN CARMACK was the main guy at id Software for years, the guys that made Doom, Quake, etc.
- JOHN CARMACK is the guy who invented true 3D graphics in 1996 (pretty sure)
- JOHN CARMACK is the guy who basically kickstarted the modern hardware graphics industry
- (*.PK3) files are basically (PK) zip files, included w/ the 1999 release of Quake III Arena.
- I had a HOSTED SITE on PLANETQUAKE.COM, here's a link to a WAYBACK MACHINE entry...
  ...to the many maps I made that used the PK3 format.
  https://web.archive.org/web/20220000000000*/planetquake.com/bfg20k 
- Many of the maps I made are STILL AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD on [..::LvL]

Then, the utility can import those files back into the GUI on another system if need be.
However, that utility isn't quite ready to show off yet.

    I used to believe that VARIABLES, were the most powerful thing about programming...
    While they ARE powerful, VARIABLES are a piece of the puzzle and are actually PROPERTIES.

    PROPERTIES are the most powerful thing about programming.
    They are part of EVERY functional language, object-oriented language, mathematical formula,
    algorithm, equation, theorem, story, character, operation, function, class, method, etc.

    As they relate to programming, every object has properties that can, at any moment, change the
    object they are part of *instantaneously*.

    Before I can really dive deeper into properties though, I have to touch on the Lamda.
"@)

$Book.AddSection(11,"<Lambda>",@"
    I'm going to shorthand all (3) of these, 1) Commands, 2) Functions and 3) Methods, as "Lamda"

    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

    |  other object(s) properties/values |
    | parent object(s) properties/values |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    A LAMBDA makes ASSUMPTIONS when not provided any PARAMETERS, based on its CONTEXT.
    A LAMBDA is very SPECIAL, because its ROLE/DUTY when EXECUTED, MAY cause the OBJECT to:

    A dude named KEVIN came along, and then suddenly, a LAMBDA was invoked...
    ...now that dude's name is MARK.

    You were expecting KEVIN.
    But the reality is, you've been told that KEVIN no longer exists.

    Now you're PISSED. KEVIN was a cool dude. Didn't deserve to be subjected to such a harsh Lambda.
    New dude named MARK looks a hell of a lot like KEVIN did... tries to tell ya that he WAS KEVIN... now he's MARK.

    That's impossible though, and you feel disrespected.

           KEVIN was twice the guy you'll EVER be...
    Mark : *scoffs* You're so predictable...
    You  : Sounds *exactly* like something KEVIN would've said, if he still existed.

    Suddenly the lambda was invoked again, changing MARK's name back to KEVIN.
    Then, you're told that KEVIN was brought back into existence.
    You turn around, there he is. KEVIN's back, dude.
    Bet you didn't see that comin' did ya...? It's almost like magic, but- even cooler than that.

    In real life, this stuff isn't possible.
    Relinquishing KEVIN's existence to bring MARK into existence...?
    It's more than just unfair. It's practically unthinkable.
    But, in the same token, relinquishing MARK's existence just to bring KEVIN back...?
    It's also unthinkable. MARK didn't do anything to deserve it either. So, then what?

    In math or programming, this stuff is definitely possible after all. That's how numbers work.
    In reference to `$List = (EXECUTABLE/COMMAND/FUNCTION/TYPE/CLASS/METHOD/VARIABLE/PROPERTY/VALUE),
    what they each have in common is that they're all specific categories that can be acted upon by a
    lambda, even though some of them are lamdas themselves.

    I will use a Dr. Seuss-like explanation, in order to (discern/differentiate) one from another:

    (1)      NOUNS are: [things]
             NOUNS are OBJECTS | KID, STORE, SODA

    (2)      VERBS are: [activities]
             VERBS are OBJECTS | GO, SEE, HAVE, BUY, RETURN

    (3)    ACTIONS are: [things doing activities]
           ACTIONS are OBJECTS | KID GOES to STORE and BUYS 1x SODA.

    (4) CONDITIONS are: [probability that a thing is 1) doing an activity, or 2) has a required value]
        CONDITIONS are OBJECTS | STORE HAS (>/greater than) 1x SODA

    (5) STATEMENTS are: [things that check a condition before doing an activity]
        STATEMENTS are OBJECTS | KID GOES to STORE, SEES 1x SODA, BUYS 1x SODA.

    (6)    STORIES are: [parallel statements involving things, activities, conditions, and actions]
           STORIES are COMPLEX OBJECTS
          
                                 KID   exists       | Noun, Verb, Action, Condition, Statement
                                 SODA  exists       | Noun, Verb, Action, Condition, Statement

    These entries above ALL meet certain criteria that allow their context to be matched or defined.
    We'll call these things PROPERTIES, since they ALL have the capability of being a PROPERTY.
    Properties can be made up of LAMBDAS, NOUNS, VERBS, ACTIONS, CONDITIONS, STATEMENTS, and STORIES.

    We cannot explicitly call a lambda the same thing as a verb, even though human intuition says they
    both match the same criteria... because a lambda MAY, or MAY NOT be a combination of these various
    elements.

    This all touches on ENGLISH, or general (linguistics/language-speaking dynamics), but it also applies to math,
    and science, because ALL of those statements have to be considered by a processing unit that can logically deduce 
    an outcome, and store the output in a VARIABLE, PROPERTY, FILE, or MEMORY ADDRESS.

    (So if you have LAZY POLICE OFFICERS or just, general, all-around, lazy people that prefer to be INACCURATE all the
    time with EVERYTHING THEY SAY/DO... then that is DANGEROUS.)

    To refine our mental variable `$List, lambdas DO occupy most of that list.
    But really, LAMBDAS specifically are the MOST difficult to CLASSIFY, and thus other definitions need to be considered,
    in order to ACCURATELY classify their TYPES. (Not that different from INVESTIGATION)

    (EXECUTABLE/COMMAND/FUNCTION/TYPE/CLASS/METHOD/VARIABLE/PROPERTY/VALUE)

    The honest/direct truth here, is that ALL of these things fall within the definition of...
    ...an EXECUTABLE.

    Why...? They're all layers of something that can be acted upon.
    If we called EVERYTHING "object", that would confuse people pretty easily... even though they ARE all objects. 
    However, believe it or not, calling an EXECUTABLE the same thing as a VALUE can be true in a specific context.

    Just like how a 10.7 GB FILE may be monstrous because of it's size, it is still a FILE.
    There may be more CONTENT in a 10.7 GB .mp4 file, versus a 10kb .txt file...
    ...but given enough thought...? A 10kb .txt file can actually reproduce a 10.7 GB .mp4 file.

    The question is, will it be an exciting, nail-biting, thriller, if a 10kb .txt file has the source code to provide 
    or BUILD that .mp4 file...? That really depends on what those instructions actually DO.
    Because, it could literally just be the same exact character repeated ...

    11489037517 many times. Yeah. It won't be an exciting, action-packed, thriller of a movie.
    If it is the same character repeated that many times, then that (*.mp4) file won't even open.
    That's pretty boring. But, there COULD actually be something WAY more boring, than a file that claims to be an 
    (*.mp4) file, won't open, and is 10.7 GB... somewhere on the internet.
    
    Though I can't imagine that anybody would really keep that on an accessible webserver.

    Anyway, 10kb of information could ALSO have a link to resources that exist elsewhere.
    So if you're like APT29, you could rick roll the US Department of Defense, make the next serious cyberattack against
    the United States look like a simple little 10kb txt file... and just wait.

    Not all Americans are THAT dumb, but they're constantly DISTRACTED and VERY HARD TO INFORM of IMPORTANT STUFF.

    Anyway, if a URL is combined with a function call like Invoke-RestMethod, that could turn APT29's latest and 
    greatest threat to national security, into an object on a bunch of computers. 

    Then again, it could also be instructions for a video codec to create an 18 hour video of nothing but static. 
    Most people that watch the 1997 movie Contact, directed by Robert Zemeckis, based on the 1985 novel with the same 
    name by Carl Sagan, starring Jodie Foster...

    ...they really don't pay much attention to the line at the end of the movie...
    "It recorded 18 hours of static". 
    But, James Woods character just wasn't super impressed...

    Nah. Cause his character was so skeptical of the entire thing, that when he found out that device recorded 18 hours of
    static (because she was *actually gone* for about 18 hours, even though all of the cameras on Earth were able to record
    the thing drop straight down in several seconds)...

    Obviously this went against everything that his character stood for. James Woods has always been a great actor, and
    performs roles where hes an asshole, very skillfully. Cause his character acted like a lot of people in real life do-
    resentful, miserable, looking for any single reason at all, to shake their finger in Jodie Foster's face.

    The truth is, PERCEPTION and PERSPECTIVE mean quite a lot to CONTEXT/CONTENT.
    That was the actual moral of the story of the 1997 movie CONTACT.

    What do these things have to do with the properties of `$WMIList, though...?

    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    These PROPERTIES all happen to be STRINGS. Nothing wicked exciting about these particular values.
    Except the vendor field is actually something to get excited about after all... in 2017, this company released a 
    brand new (CPU/computer processing architecture) that took the industry to new heights. 

    This new architecture, believe it or not, was fabricated < 10 miles from where I live... side point.

    In reference to these properties, each of them could in fact, be TRANSLATED, into something else, when a particular
    STRATEGY is seen. Doesn't necessarily have to be SEEN either. Because, there's a particular strategy that can be used, 
    to detect someone elses particular strategy, via a PATTERN.

    Probably sounds like 10-dimensional chess or something, using a strategy to detect a pattern that detects someone 
    elses strategy... but, that's actually what computers are programmed to do.

    The fact of the matter is, while they are *all* PROPERTIES, some are specific (types/classes), in addition to being a
    property and a value. For instance, IdentifyingNumber is a (GUID/globally-unique identifier).
    The reason I know this, is because GUID's all follow a specific "convention" or "pattern".

    When an object is serialized, it turns an object, its properties, and values, into a string.
    Before a Lambda decided it was time, to tell this object "You're about to be serialized, bub"...?
    
    It was an OBJECT. Happy as could be, too.
    Until the LAMBDA ordered it to become a STRING, and did what it was told...
    
    Now, the OBJECT no longer exists, because it was forced to become a STRING.
    While a STRING is still technically an OBJECT...? It's not QUITE the same thing.

    Not too dissimilar from MARK telling his buddy that he WAS KEVIN, but- now he's MARK...
    Nobody believes MARK, that he WAS KEVIN. Could look virtually identical to KEVIN, too...
    Might even sound like KEVIN when he talks. Might smell like KEVIN, eat the same food as KEVIN,
    and say the same things as KEVIN...? But nobody will ever believe MARK, that he WAS KEVIN.
    ...now he's MARK.

    Anyway, reinstantiation is a lot less dramatic, but it does involve patterns and properties to be
    specifically named. The correct lambda has to detect those properties, and test patterns, in order
    to reinstantiate the string back into an object.

    If that object has any chance at all... of being willed back into existence?
    A specific pattern could be the key ingredient in making all the difference in the world.
    Suffice to say, strings can be (converted back into objects/deserialized), given enough context.

    The IdentifyingNumber here can be reconstituted back into a GUID, but that is actually very tough.
    Might need help from a magic lamp.

    So, grab the closest magic lamp you can find.
    Then, rub the lamp slightly, be sure not to upset the genie inside...

    We don't need a snarky, irritated genie... do we? Of course not...
    When the big blue genie finally comes out?
    That's the moment where you gotta wish for the string to become a GUID again.
    Piece of cake, right?

    I'm just kidding, it's actually easier than all of that. No lamps, no wishes.
    Just a basic understanding of Regular Expressions, the most advanced mathematical probability matrix available to
    mankind... where written languages and mathematics are merged into logical roadmaps... 

    Logical roadmaps that make branch predictions...
    ...branch predictions chiseling out the course of action that any modern microprocessor can be expected to take,
    at least, whenever they're programmed to perform specific lambdas in response to (parameters/input) it is provided.

    That's the cinematic, long-winded explanation... for patterns in strings of serialized text.

    "[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}"
    ...can be used to match any GUID in existence, if the letters are lowercase. Not uppercase.
    ...if they're uppercase...? There's nothing anybody can do. It's over... time to go home.

    Just kiddin'. Even if they're uppercase, the pattern will probably still work, however-
    nobody can say that with any certainty at all, without knowing the casing operand.
    If you really want to be on the safe side, then the pattern should be written this way,
    "[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}"

    The reason why people don't really like that idea is because it made that pattern longer.
    There are a number of ways to shorthand that pattern.
    Here's a cool way to do it in PowerShell...
    (8,4,4,4,12 | % { "[0-9a-fA-F]{`$_}" }) -join '-'

    Anyway, these patterns represent a globally unique identifier, and they're useful in many ways.
    Does the value for property "IdentifyingNumber" for variable `$WMIList match the pattern...?

    If we're being serious, there's PLENTY we can do here.

    IF    a) dropping the 'c' from "-cmatch" is out of your hands...?
    AND   b) the pattern can't be changed
    THEN  c) no drama here, uppercase letters ARE impossible to filter out w/ this (condition/pattern) combo.

    Though, there are PLENTY of WORKAROUNDS, one being that you could force the input string to use a method
    called .ToLowercase() on the string, probably plenty of other workarounds if you think of them.

    But, typically people won't use "-cmatch", not unless they're being strict about CASING.

    -cmatch means CASE   SENSITIVE
    -imatch means CASE INSENSITIVE
    -match  means both will match

    Suppose we had to comb through a billion of these GUIDs...?
    It would require more data to FIND these patterns, than to simply interact with it ourselves.

    What would help here, is assigning a STATIC METHOD that will remember the pattern. 
    That way, the pattern doesn't SPAM everybody with a CLONE of itself for EVERY ITERATION of a GUID out there.

    I can tell you with sheer certainty, that if my old business partner decided that he HAD to hire an employee to
    specifically screen a lot of input strings, to determine by EYE, whether a GUID is bogus or not...? I'd tell him:

    Not JUST because that would be the most boring job in the world, but that's a pretty boring way to handle such a 
    simple problem. Yeah. That employee he had to hire, they'll make many mistakes over the course of having to 
    CONFIRM 8,4,4,4,12 base 16 digits, a billion times. 

    They'll ALSO take FAR longer to do the scope of work. 
    Whereas, a REGEX pattern costs a lot less time/money/resources AND saves someone from having to hire an employee
    to do (1) specific, and mundane job... one that will expectedly bore that employee to sleep. 

    In other words, "ineffecient as hell". AKA, bad idea.
    The pattern covers ALL of the mathematical probabilities that a GUID will match, using base16 for each character 
    within the GUID string convention. 8, 4, 4, 4, 12 | where each number represents the number of consecutive base16
    digits, and then joins each group with hyphens, and wraps it all with the curliest curly braces in existence.

    I'll demonstrate a complicated way to create a class that generates a legitimate GUID. 
    This class will actually perform ADDITIONAL roles/duties/methods, that the base class [Guid] doesn't.

          That's just WAY too tough for me...

          Not if you want to learn how to correctly build cool stuff, and be considered cool too.

          Then I guess it's time for you to act like mom, throw your hands up, and just, quit...

    Me  : Big-boy pants.
          You wanna try some on... right?
    Kid : I already have big-boy pants on.
    Me  : *chuckles* Kid, those don't look like big-boy pants, at all.
    Kid : Yeah, they are.
    Me  : Nah, those look more like pull-ups...
          ...that's what young toddlers wear...
          ...toddlers are less than half your age...
          Those aren't big-boy pants...
    Kid : *trying not to grin* Will I be able to program my own game, if I listen to you...?
    Me  : That depends on you, ya friggen' pull-up wearin', kid-faced, boymeister.
    Kid : *huge grin on his face* Dad...
    Me  : What's up kid...?
          Ready to wear some big-boy pants...?
    Kid : *makes a pretend clenched fist, still smiling, starts laughing...* They're not pull-ups.
    Me  : Kid, those things are AT BEST, something that would be skin tight on a teenager.
    Kid : That means they're big-boy pants after all.
    Me  : *scoffs* Kid, when I say big-boy pants...?
          I mean like, pants that an ADULT would wear.
    Kid : *chuckling* Heh.
          Yeh dad...? Well...
          *chuckling* How come you're not wearin' any?
    Me  : Ah, good question.
          You'll never believe this, kid...
          But- I outgrew mine.
    Kid : *rolls his eyes* Whatever...
    Me  : Wait till you're ready to try some on, kid... all this stuff'll help.

    That's because the command is accessing that specific type via that function/cmdlet.
    However, there are other methods within the class that I'd like to access, so it shows more details.
"@)

$Book.AddSection(11,"Notes + Method Chaining",@"
    The other manner is to use a variable, which allows a user to have extended control over the methods within a
    class/type. Without casting it to a variable, there's no way to access those methods, unless you chain the method 
    on at the end. If you use the variable assignment manner, you don't have to do that.
    ____________________________________________________________________________
    | Method chaining is OK in some scenarios, but I don't like ever using it. |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    In my opinion, method chaining has an extremely bad pitfall.
    
    Why...? 
    Well, if any single method in that method chain returns a $null/empty value...?

    Now the object is null. 
    It WASN'T null... at least, not up until it returned (1) null value.

    THEN, it went from NOT NULL at all... to DEFINITELY NULL.
    And, there's NO indication as to how that happened, either.

    Except, there is an indication, I'm telling you.
    (1) method in the chain returned NULL.

    It can only be (1) method that will do this, because once the object is null, then it can't process any 
    additional methods. Cause the object is gone now.

    Look, you can spend entire days arguing with the computer, or me. 
    It won't change anything.
    Just know... that I am absolutely correct here. Trust me on that.

    If billions of methods WERE already able to return output...? They probably did.
    But, so long as (1) single null value got returned...? Doesn't matter anymore.

    A value was returned in a method chain, it nullified the entire object, and that time was wasted.

    It'll FEEL like it's doing work. 
    And, it's definitely doing work (though I don't know what the hell it is),
    But- you won't SEE any output... 

    It goes completely against all forms of logic. 
    WASN'T NULL, but then it got taken out of the game... and now it's NULL.

    It's like when an overexcited dog sees you come home. 
    Dog's wicked happy, and starts running around the house, galloping with full overexcited body movements, 
    practically jumping diagonally at walls and stuff...? Acting like a big idiot, cause you came home. 

    THEN, while he's hurling his whole body around practically giving himself whiplash...?
    Well, when he's not lookin... fake him out, and walk back outside.

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    You : Heh. That'll show ya, dog face...

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    Now, the dog is STILL, running around the house. 
    Cause, he definitely saw ya...
    You know he saw ya, and... he knows that YOU know he saw ya... 
    That's why he'll still be runnin' around the house like a big idiot... ecstatic that you came home. 
    But, when the dog does this for a while, realizes you aren't in the house... he'll be thinkin: 

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Dog : What the hell, dude...?
          Where'd ya go...?

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    Then he'll be sad, staring at the door. 
    Tilting his head to the side, slightly.
    Then, tilting it the other way... 

    He's still thinkin:

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Dog : What the hell? 
          Thought he was... home...?

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    Same principle applies to method chaining, and you... waiting for the output.
    When you see absolutely no output? ...trust me. 
    Stay a few steps ahead of the dog here.

    A single method is all it took for ALL of that hard work to return... ...nothing.
    That's because, it WAS doing work. 
    It WAS actually processing information.

    Until it got nullified from existence... just like how KEVIN was.

    You COULD even be like me, and get pretty creative about what might've happened.
    MAYBE, it grew a case of dementia. The object ITSELF doesn't even know where the hell it is.

    The PowerShell host, too... probably has no earthly idea where that data went.
    If the PowerShell host, nor the object itself have a clue where the hell it is, or what's going on... 
    What can anybody do...? 

    Nobody knows what happened. Nor what to do.

    It's like someone having a cabin in the woods, and the owner doesn't know the address.
    They'll GO there... but, they'll get no mail. No phone calls either. Or visitors. Months later, they'll resurface.
    Walking around in a grocery store naked, Like Walter White in his fugue state.

    These are the dangers of method chaining, my friends.
    Unless you do an amazing job of teeing the objects within the classes you write, it's a bad idea.
    
    However, theres a cool way to avoid all of that.
    If you DON'T use method chains. That's really, all that needs to be done, to avoid problems.

    Methods, in a long continuous chain...? Separate them.
    Then, if one of those methods returns null...? Then object won't be wiped from existence at all.
    Nah. It'll still exist, the method just won't do anything to it. Then, you're good.

    If I want to reset the Guid, I can do so with the variable I already declared, and add the method. 
    If building a class that MAY have to reset itself, it's good to have a separate method from the instantiation 
    block, right...? And in that instantiation block, call that method. Then, it'll work perfectly each time. 
    Review the class I wrote above to see what I mean.

    There's actually a third manner that I haven't mentioned, that I'll have to exhibit, but not yet.

    That third manner involves writing a (function/type/class) and adding this particular child class to that parent 
    class. Writing a method within a parent class which instantiates a child class, is a very useful way to build 
    factory-like classes, and this can be implemented with functions too.

    Parent class scopes provide a parent scope to access it's child class methods as well as their own, providing 
    the parent a LOT more functionality... but with added functionality is added complexity, and the possibility 
    that things get lost in translation without a reference.

    Still, it is extremely useful, however, I won't cover that here.

    To the untrained eye, it may appear as if I went on a lot of tangents and haven't quite made them seem very 
    relevant... To the trained eye? I've opened up a lot of points of discussion that will make later comparisons

    There he is... KEVIN's BACK in action, dude.

    The type block in front of the $Variable.Property, converts that object into that type.
    Sometimes the value will not be able to convert itself at all, then you'l get an error message.

    However, when it works, it works beautifully, and it feels as if those objects were meant to be.
    The class that I wrote...? Sure, it might've been overly-complicated to return that specific type...

    I was also able to integrate these various details back into the overarching lesson plan after all. 
    Now, it IS definitely debatable as to whether or not anybody should go ahead, and reinvent the wheel, or 
    whatever pseudonym people want to use... but, that's not what I did at all.

    Every wheel has a process in it's construction. 
    Not every wheel manufacturer out there will be thrilled or ecstatic with the idea of somebody showing EVERYBODY 
    around town, that *ANY* ordinary person who follows their step-by-step manufacturing process... can build 
    themselves one of the most kick-ass friggen wheels anyone ever made.

    Cause at that point, they might get jealous when they see how COOL your wheel making process became. 
    Then what...? 
    They're gonna ask you to show 'em how it's done. 
    
    Cause. They're gonna wanna see this wheel making process of YOURS, since you went ahead and took things to a 
    whole new level... They may stand around the watercooler at work the next day, telling everyone there, that you 
    were absolutely determined...

    Some of them might've been jealous, but, maybe it became envy after a while.
    They saw determination they hadn't seen before...

    Now, you're one of them. 
    They made the best wheels in history, and then you just learned how to make the best wheels in history too...

    Now, are you really reinventing the wheel...? Or are you Bruce Wayne, training to be in the League of Shadows, 
    having a sword battle with Rahs Al Guhl... The dude is insanely skilled, can't really leave much to chance... 
    dude's been all around the world, being a total menace.

    Not a phantom menace per se, but- a menace nonetheless. 
    Even if Batman gets any edge at all, Rahs Al Guhl is gonna try to slip him up so he loses his balance on the ice.

    Batman may have barely won the sword fight on top of that frozen lake... 
    But, even Batman has to be mindful of whenever he's on real thin ice...
    ...otherwise, he might lose his footing, and drop into that really cold water.
    (^ Extended metaphor)

    In reality, I tore apart many components of what makes a class, a class, discussed what can be an object, 
    property, or value, explained what Regular Expressions can accomplish/do, and provided an in depth example 
    where I've added functionality to a standard base class...

    I'm going to continue with the properties here from `$WMIList, as there is (1) other property here that can have 
    a [type] applied to it that isn't JUST a string...

    ...however, it's worth noting that entire classes can be represented by a string, so sometimes the string output 
    isn't always telling of how complex an object truly is. Regardless...
   
    Here's the property box again...

    Now, this all started with some action jam packed into Line #1.
    It needed a breakdown, but now, I'm going to finish what I started in reference to properties.

    A VARIABLE, is an object that has a 1) name and a 2) value. Those are both properties.
    A VARIABLE can ALSO be multiple objects that each have their own 1) name and 2) value.
    A NAME is a PROPERTY.
    A VALUE is also a PROPERTY.
    A PROPERTY is consisted of a 1) NAME and a 2) VALUE.

    But, how can a PROPERTY be consisted of it's own PROPERTIES...?
    ...that's just how the game is played, dudemeister.

    OBJECTS are made up of PROPERTIES, and VALUES... and when PROPERTIES and VALUES are accumulated...
    ...then you have COLLECTIONS of PROPERTIES. 
    PROPERTIES definitely qualify as VARIABLES.

    But, VARIABLES themselves aren't necessarily PROPERTIES, not unless they are attached to a specific OBJECT...
"@)

$Book.AddSection(11,"<Console> (9)",@'
    In PowerShell, if a VARIABLE IS NOT attached to an [Object], then the VARIABLE is a property of the current
    (PowerShell host/execution context). THAT is the [Object] (that/those) VARIABLE(S) are properties of.

    That's because it was a PROPERTY of the PREVIOUS PowerShell Host that you exited.
    Now, PROPERTIES can be written to disk, via files, or to memory pointers or even the registry...
    But, short of using those manners to EXPORT the PROPERTIES...?
    VARIABLES are PROPERTIES of the PowerShell Host.
    So if you CLOSE it...?
    Those PROPERTIES are erased.

    Hence, why you've seen the VARIABLE go back to “”.

    If I know my stuff, what you just did...?
    It returned nothing. 

    That's because the variable above "`$Stuff" was a property of the host object in the session you just closed. 
    Then you just went ahead and closed that host... and opened a new one. Now, the property isn't there anymore. 

    The variable has to be declared again, if you want to continue using that variable.
    I realize it's a rather anticlimactic way to prove my point, but- 
    ...that process just proves the point, that variables, if they don't belong to an object? 

    They're properties of the current PowerShell Host.
    So to compare, a square and a rhombus aren't the same thing...
    ...not unless a specific rhombus meets the (1) condition where all of its angles are 90 degrees.

    When that condition is true, then that rhombus is most definitely, ALSO a square.
    Otherwise, a rhombus which doesn't fit that condition, is only a rhombus, not both.

    Many of the components I mentioned like nouns, verbs, actions, conditions, statements, stories, and 
    invocations/instantiations, they all have a similar situation where under certain conditions any given sentence 
    may meet MULTIPLE CRITERIA.

    The rhombus having 4 90 degree angles is pretty rare.
    Most of the time, it could be a diamond shaped rhombus.

    It won't be a parallelogram, and it might ALMOST look like a square...? But, only almost.
    In the story I wrote way farther up, a kid wanted a soda, went to a store, grabbed the soda, clerk said "money", 
    kid said "no money", clerk insisted "money", kid started fake crying... clerk said "money", kid stopped fake 
    crying, kid got mad...

    Well, truth be told, that is a STORY, but it is ALSO basically a PROGRAM.

    The kid was a character, the store was a setting, the clerk was another character, the conflict was that the kid 
    wanted the soda and didn't have money. All of those things were a character in the story, the perspective from one 
    to another allowed each of them to be a class with certain definitions.

    The point is, all of these things I talk about can be different things, simultaneously. 
    Objects can be just an object, but that's pretty doubtful... because they can ALSO be a string at a bare minimum.

    Anyway, objects become strings when serialized, and sometimes they have an issue being deserialized, and this can 
    cause problems with object reinstantiation. However, patterns and conditions being met allow deserialization to be 
    more consistent and exact. 

    Also, sometimes the quantity of properties, or a number of matched existing property names and/or values can ALSO 
    help  determine a specific type of object from another. We're just about done talking about properties. 

    The key thing to remember about all of this, is that:
    _____________________________________________________________________________________________________
    | PROPERTIES    | can either be a NULL/VOID OBJECT, SINGLE [OBJECT] or MULTIPLE [OBJECTS[]]         |
    | VALUES        | can ALSO either be a NULL/VOID OBJECT, SINGLE [OBJECT], or MULTIPLE [OBJECTS[]]   |
    | VARIABLES     | are technically PROPERTIES of the PowerShell Host/console                         |
    | TYPES/CLASSES | are consisted of [PROPERTIES], [VALUES], and [METHODS] (also, [CONSTRUCTORS])     |
    | COMMANDS      | are nearly identical to a [FUNCTION], and they both accept PARAMETERS             |
    | METHODS       | are a lot like a FUNCTION, but it is a PROPERTY of a TYPE/CLASS/FUNCTION.         |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    [COMMANDS], [FUNCTIONS], [TYPES/CLASSES], and [METHODS] are all LAMBDAS, and they can be a PROPERTY of an OBJECT.

    [FUNCTIONS] are a specific calculation, or cluster of calculations that MAY or MAY NOT accept PARAMETERS.

    [ACTIONS], [CONDITIONS], [STATEMENTS], and [STORIES] are consisted of all the above, and while all of these things 
    are an [OBJECT]...?

    They all have varying [SCOPES], [DEFINITIONS], [PROPERTIES] and [VALUES].
    Does this feel Dr. Suess-like yet?

    Cause, I've barely cracked the surface of how complex logic can get, though this is a SOLID foundation.

    To keep this as concise as possible, everything that I just listed can be represented by a [BOOLEAN] when 
    testing conditions. That's just how it works. Even with Regex.

    An object's existence can be created or nullified at any moment when a condition is tested, the condition may 
    be consisted of any assortment of things up above, but typically a condition is when a noun does a verb and a 
    count of something matches or exceeds the minimum condition, or likewise in the opposite direction, where a 
    count is equal to or less than the maximum allowable count.

    When that condition passes or fails, The switch is activated and that branch is entered.
    There are some things that the computer just can't do ahead of time, given the numerous matematical possibilities 
    that exist in the universe... But, when it joins the branch, it can get more detailed about what to look for. 

    Hence, why properties are so important.
    The property rundown is finito. Now, you just gotta ask yourself one question... Maybe 3.
    Who's the boss, NOW, buddy? Is it you? Or Tony Danza? (Or, is it Angela...?)

    It's time to go all out beast mode with the $WMIList Object.
    Now we're going to start dynamically building a class definition, for WMIObject.

    Some people will probably be pretty amazed by this process here.
    To get all of the property 1) names, 2) types, and 3) values, use the property:
    
    $WMIList.PSObject.Properties => (produces a pretty big chart)

    We can use techniques similar to Line #1, by using the pipeline.
    Pipeline operations can use direct property names to select or query internal property values.

    Assigning the variable $Prop to the entire operation, will store the output from the operation to the variable. 
    
                    The REGEX to the left, is filtering out WMI+PS classes while making the assignment.
    ______________  The Regex probably needs a little explanation.
    |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|  The Regex pattern is wrapped with parenthesis, indicating a capture group
    | "(^_|^PS)" |  The pipeline symbol in the middle is an OR symbol.
    |____________|  The Caret indicates the START of a string
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯  The underscore matches an underscore, and the PS matches the letters PS.

    If you're hesitant to run the operation that isn't commented out below, feel free to run the line right underneath 
    the dashed line below, it won't actually assign the output to anything. The one below that which says Format-Table,
    will show you the table output, not the list.

    We want to format the class with the right spacing between elements, cause I'm a perfectionist AND precise. 
    All of the type names and property names will line up if we collect em all to find the length of the longest type.

    Assign the variable $Types to the following loop ONE-LINER.
    The entire ONE-LINER BELOW is a COLLECTION of STRATEGIES thrown into a single line, actually.
    Some of my Voodoo 3 5000 magic...

    To explain, it's a multifaceted ONE-LINER involving:
    - ForEach-Object haphazardly piping itself into an array...
    - $_ token with the property length being greater than 0 in square brackets acts as a switch
    - $False selects slot 0 in the array returning the string "String", cause that's binary for ya.
    - $True selects slot 1 in the array returning ($_ -Replace "System\.","")

$Book.AddSection(11,"<Class Definition> Summary",@"
    Above, the newly constructed class has been cleanly formatted, and procedurally spaced out.
    But, here's why it's not all that COOL or USEFUL... yet.

    If the constructed class is NO different than selecting ALL of the properties on the default command output, 
    then... there's basically no point in doing all of this work. If you're adding methods, or other properties, 
    THEN, there is. If you're NOT, though? There isn't much of a reason... regardless, it's a good way to see how
    it is CONSTRUCTED.

    But in practice, unless you're planning on ADDING custom methods or properties...? 
    Then, there's an easier way to do all of that, and it's as simple as running the command, and capturing the 
    output to a variable.

    Cause that's how you COULD get the same output from the default command with far less work. 
    Then again, there could be other reasons, maybe some properties are hidden and you don't LIKE when properties 
    are hidin' out on ya... Well, it's hard for me to imagine that someone would do all of this just to spite some 
    hidden properties... but maybe somebody would...? Idk.

    However, there was a point to doing this after all.

    Instantiate the variable, class definition below.
    This enables the class to be used without having to explicitly write the
    `$Classdefinition output to the clipboard or the editor.

    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    They do the same thing.

    I actually would like to discuss the difference between these two manners right here.

    Manner (1) says that the command gets to ForEach-Object itself, into a new instantiaion of the class we just 
    generated, and then invoked into memory, above using the $ClassDefinition variable. For each object it finds...? 
    Then, a new object is instantiated, even if it ONLY returns a SINGLE OBJECT. 
    Then, the output is saved to the variable $Collect.

    Manner (2) literally does the same exact thing, but since it is written differently, it's worth explaining that 
    they may not ALWAYS result in the same output...

    The [Win32_Product[]] is an object array, you can tell with the "[]" inside the square brackets.
    The @ symbol is actually denoting that the content of those parenthesis is EXPECTING MULTIPLE OBJECTS, 
    So, using that technique with a FUNCTION in the PARENTHESIS, allows EVERY object that the function returns, 
    as THAT specific type/class, X number of times- even if it ONLY returns a SINGLE OBJECT.

    Maybe people don't realize that a type and a class are actually the same thing (usually), and I should've said
    that at some point in the previous 1500+ lines. 

    Well... a type is a class, and a class is a type... the terms, I'm fairly certain, are literally interchangeable.

$Book.AddSection(11,"Computer Updated - Press F1",@"
    Uh-oh... Matthew Caldwell didn't do any Google searches BEFORE having me image a thousand machines in the
    warehouse... Now I gotta do ALL that work all over again, because of this following article...

    https://xkln.net/blog/please-stop-using-win32product-to-find-installed-software-alternatives-inside 
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Now, this is where our development process got thrown on it's head. 
    Why...? Oh, I'll tell ya...

    These guys say that the manner I've been using to collect a list of installed applications, is the way that LAME 
    people do it. Yep. Me...? Doing something the lame way. As usual. Couldn't believe that these guys knew me so well. 

    Still. When I found out? I swear, I didn't cry. Kept my head up. Eyes forward. Just... kept on goin'.

    Eventually... I realized that they don't actually say anything about ANYBODY being lame. Nah. 
    I just interpreted it that way...

    They were just saying that WMIObject Win32_Product is SORTA broken (because legacy WMIC is rather complicated)

    I felt better after I realized that...
    Can't believe I actually *allowed* myself to be so distraught by words they never even said...
    Jeez... That's when I took a deep breath, said to myself "it'll be okay"... and then, read the entire thing 
    they said. 

    I'm just kidding about being upset, I already have a function that does what this article suggests, because I 
    figured out how the experts look for installed programs way back in 2019 after I started following a team of 
    awesome guys' GitHub project...

    Come to find that they used to be some heavy hitters at Microsoft. 
    These guys wrote a book that I read. 
    That book became an odyssey into the programming world... 

    Anyway, Johan Arwidmark and Mykael Nystrom wrote that book. 
    What I didn't know back then, and what I happen to know NOW, is that they literally wrote the friggen book, 
    about how professionals get stuff done. Not only did they have so much helpful information about how the 
    professionals get stuff done... they also have a portion of their books and projects reserved for experts 
    that know what they're doing. 

    They have to at least TRY to keep this information low-key, because of how USEFUL it is. (Kidding)

    One of those suggestions, is using the registry to look for installed program and stuff. 
    For years they had an edge over everybody with this WAY cooler, more efficient way to get stuff done... 
    I realize, they WILL probably tell people that they didn't write a special series of chapters and entries for 
    the most highly seasoned experts out there in the wild... But obviously, they're not gonna tell people about 
    secret chapters they wrote and authored... 

    Some people really should consider... not all heroes wear capes. 
    These guys know what the hell they're doin'.

    Anyway, the registry. 
    It's not a thing people should play games with, but, sometimes an expert gets called in, to take a look around 
    and perform a highly skilled site survey. Sometimes that happens to include taking a pretty quick look at it, 
    especially if you're looking for programs to install or uninstall, and you need those programs to be a specific
    version, or higher.

    Guess who I learned from on how to do those things? Heh. One of the most highly seasoned experts at Microsoft.
    Following the link above they say: Don't use Get-WMIObject Win32_Product anymore...

    It's slow, incomplete, problematic, not optimized, it's just a bad way to go about getting that info anyway, since
    Microsoft LITERALLY invested a LOT of time and resources in CimV2. 

    Fine I won't use WMIC. However, it means I have to reproduce the class stuff I already did...
    Look. If you wanna go pro...? Use the REGISTRY, and look in the following keys/paths:
    __________________________________________________________________________________
    | 64-bit | HKLM:\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall |

    The problem is, now the class definition is out of date!
    We don't need the old one anymore, cause it doesn't have what we need.

    Time to write a totally new one.
    However, what complicates matters here, is that each of these registry keys all have differing properties/entries 
    in the registry - not only are they VERY different from Get-WMIObject Win32_Product, but they also contain 
    inconsistent properties and values.
    
    While SOME of the values are consistent... some of em aren't. So, this is a bit of a dilemma...
    We might actually have to whip out the magic lamp again and make a new wish...

    How long should a person with a magic lamp wait, before making another wish...?

    You   : Yeah. 
            I need to write a new class that can accommodate a bunch of registry keys on Windows.
    Genie : Oh *scoffs* 
            Obviously, that is worthy of another wish... that... is one of the toughest things a person can even do.
    You   : Alright Genie, you don't have to patronize me, I get it... 
            I know I'm no Albert Einstein, but this really is hard to do right...
    Genie : Well... you're not wrong. It is hard to do right. Plenty of ways to do it wrong.
    You   : Yeah. Well...
            *suddenly, you remember that you read a tutorial once upon a time*

    Genie : No, no, no, no... 
            Alright, you can make this wish some other time.
    You   : ...really?
    Genie : Yeh. 
            Sorry boss man.
    You   : Strange. 
            Alright, talk to you later.

    Strange. The genie came at ya all sideways at first, but when told that he could even have the wishes back...? 
    He changed his tune~! 

    Maybe the reason, is cause when people would rather do something tough on their own, especially if they can make 
    any wish they want...? Genies know that means they won't be needed... Then they gotta wait around for like, 
    10 thousand years all over again... They probably get bored waiting around all that time. So.

    There's no need for a magic lamp, nor any wishes here. 
    We are just gonna use a strategy, in order to: 1) conceptualize, and 2) build a class factory

    One that handles the properties of this specific situation involving registry keys, for programs.

    So, defining a class may be difficult to do, UNLESS theres a way to determine which TYPE of registry entry each 
    of them may be, or we could even pull a template object, and use that draft the class... 
    If we did that, then, we could provide an abstract way to force all of the items in `$Apps to fit within the 
    same class for every entry.

    To do this, lets start with a common application that was installed via MSI, since that has standard options 
    and the most consistency (so, like Microsoft Edge, or Google Chrome...)

    Now, NON-DEFAULT registry keys in these uninstall paths (64-bit/32-bit) may contain some very old school entries 
    that aren't updated anymore. So, whether those entries are ADVANCED, or just OLD.

    Don't get down on registry keys in this folder if their properties aren't the same as everybody elses. 
    Because, we can actually implement a DESIGN CHANGE to the CLASS that ACCOMMODATES any *unexpected properties*. 
    They won't be a part of the BASE class properties, but they'll still be visible and accessible. 
    So, everybody actually wins.
    
    There's a few ways we could do this, we could ADD a member to each class for EACH property.

    However, that isn't a great idea. 
    That will make many of them TOO DIFFERENT, and not adhere to a TABLE, as they'll be TOO unique in some cases. 
    
    Then, everybody will have to collectively sigh at the "advanced" guy's properties. 
    So, the best option would be to create a property that can host those "extraneous" properties, and that 
    property's value will be an object that can host an array of ADDITIONAL properties & values that are NON-DEFAULT. 

    That is the best way to go, actually.
    Now, lets choose a property name like "EntryUnique". If we add this property BEFORE we access the 
    PSObject.Properties, the addition will form to the format of the previously written stuff above.
    
    We'll also need to ADD a few METHODS to this class (methods are nested functions), so it can refer to itself, 
    provide self referencing brevity, and convert each individual NON-DEFAULT property, into an object array for
    each property. Then, we want to have a method that can format all of those objects and properties and write 
    the output.

    For the script that applies spacing/formatting to include the new property, and not need an added script at the

    Looks like a standard, ordinary, run-of-the-mill, object collection table.
    In order to INSERT a NEW PROPERTY to this list of properties, we have to figure out what each of these objects 
    actually are. Now you could also use the Add-Member cmdlet, but there's another way.
    
    The $Prop.GetType() method will return the "Object Type" object as seen below.

    So, it's an object array, which is easy to spot because of the ol' double square brackets there.
    We sorta knew this from the object collection table up above.

    But, in order to ADD a new object to it, we have to determine what TYPE these objects in the array actually are, 
    and then... instantiate that TYPE. Select the first item of the array to determine what type of object array it is.

    Alright, so it's a PSNoteProperty array.
    We knew that from the object table, but now we aren't making assumptions.

    We can attempt to directly access the underlying base type.
    Now, is PSNoteProperty an object that anybody could instantiate in PowerShell, without calling an assembly or 
    adding a type definition...?

    Since the cmdlet New-Object PSNoteProperty doesn't provide an idea for the PARAMETERS we need to feed it without 
    help, lets call the .NET base type, via [PSNoteProperty]::New but, with a twist.
    BTW: "[PSNoteProperty]::New()" literally does the same thing as "New-Object PSNoteProperty"

     Each entry is Haskell-Cased. That means they all look <Proper with Capitalized Letters>.
     Not every entry on the list will actually WORK if you go to use it as is.

     Because, they are each atypically split to provide a comparison chart.
     Some of these WILL work though, but testing them all, and knowing WHY which ones work...
     ...and which ones don't, is an important skill to have. Hence, why I made the chart.

     While there ARE very subtle differences and variations here, they ALL draw some parallel structure AND more 
     than just abstract similarity to one another. Can you spot the similarities?

$Book.AddSection(11,"PowerShell Class/Type Engine Assumptions",@'
    Not all of the labels appear in each instance. 
    With PowerShell, the console is pretty good about ASSUMING (classes/types) for each variable. 
    That's because of the PowerShell Class/Type engine.
    
    CSharp has no such 'making assumptions about any given variable' functionality, because it requires some 
    hefty-handed SPECIFICITY and NEEDS to be strongly typed... Otherwise, expect many failures.

    In PowerShell, the engine was made to make a lot of assumptions, and it was designed SO well, that it gets it 
    right quite consistently. It's easy to take what it does, for granted.

    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    CSharp #1 has spacing that would cause compilation failures right off the bat (I believe), they were added to 
    examine the components of each line. Typically each CSharp entry needs a semicolon at the (end of line/EOL), but 
    not AFTER method invocation. In PowerShell, EOL semicolons are NOT necessary.
    _______________________________________________________________________________
    | (2) CSharp #2 → PSNoteProperty Variable = New PSNoteProperty( Name, Value ) |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    I don't work with CSharp often enough to remember the specifics of calling types for each variable name and etc... 
    But- I still read it every day, as I implement a lot of it in PowerShell.

    I DO know that CSharp is a *very* strongly typed language. 
    CSharp #2 is technically invalid, and won't work as is. 
    The parameters within the parenthesis do not have the types before them.

    However, it CAN work, as long as it is part of a code block where those variables are already declared with types. 
    In other words, by itself it would fail. 
    But, if those variables just so happened to be declared already in a larger block, it would work.

    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    PowerShell Example #1 shows you that if you use the .Net Class/Type [SquareBrackets]::New() instantiation
    approach, you'll need to wrap them in square brackets and call a static method with the double colon.

    Translating static methods from CSharp to PowerShell requires a little finagling, because in C#, the methods are 
    called with "::". Another difference between CSharp and PS, are [SquareBrackets] around [Types] or [Classes].

    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    PowerShell Example #3 will not work without wrapping [String]$Name in ([String]$Name)

    That's because assumed parameters work a little differently. 
    The Class/Type engine is awesome, but it's not Superman, bro... it can't do everything. 

    As such, wrapping parenthesis around ([String]$Name) causes the engine to resolve the entry in the 
    parenthesis as it relates to the Order of Operations in mathematics. 

    If using [Type]$Variable as parameter input, they're absolutely necessary.
    _______________________________________________
    | Using non-quoted strings as parameter input |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    A worthy thing to note here, is that using non-quoted strings as command parameters may not need quotes, at least 
    if there are no spaces in the string. For example...
     ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    ...but that only works for strings that have NO spaces. 
    Still, any tip or trick that can whittle away at character counts actually aids in making scripts easier to read,
    clearer, and more concise. Plus, knowing these tricks can help you during the conceptualization/design process.

    Like for instance, if you wanted to name something "Cool Name", you could cast a variable, and that may keep the 
    space, and you use that as a parameter. But, lets say you run into a different scope, as that is often the case 
    with class structures. Man. The name "Cool Name" may cause you to have to write a fair amount MORE code, than not 
    using the space at all.

    Also, on another note, this trick also works as pipeline property input, like so:
     ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    PS Prompt:\> Get-ChildItem "$Env:SystemDrive\" | ? Name -match Windows      ← See, no quotes
    PS Prompt:\> Get-ChildItem "$Env:SystemDrive\" | ? Name -match ^\w+         ← Works w/ Regex
    ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/
     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    The reason why these work, is because the pipeline is accessing properties in a similar manner to how 
    (Get-Item $Path | Select-Object Name, Fullname, <etc>) works, so long as the pipeline is not within a literal
    scriptblock or curly braces where the ($_ / Null) variable works, then this naked string input will work just 
    fine... as long as you're not using exotic characterss, or spaces.

$Book.AddSection(11,"Excerpt [~] Comparing CSharp & PowerShell",@"
    The take away from all of this explanation, is that PowerShell is LITERALLY the same exact thing as CSharp under 
    the skin, though I'm sure someone from Microsoft will pop out, and say:
    __________________
    | MS Guy : Nope. |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Fine. There are obviously many caveats with them being basically identical.
    _________________
    | MS Guy : Yup. |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    So, in order to adhere to the holy sacred art, of knowing what the hell I'm talking about, then calling it 
    IDENTICAL to CSharp is incorrect. That said, the fact of the matter is that PowerShell is basically written 
    with CSharp constructs, and has the same Common Language Runtime/CLR Framework.

    So, it stands to reason they use many (if not all) of the same components. 
    ____________________
    | MS Guy: Maybe... |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    So, I have to expect that this Microsoft Guy is gonna watch my words like a HAWK...
    Because, after so many years of snappin' necks and cashin' checks...? He's used to all of that strongly written 
    type... and he's not the type of dude who plays games. 
    __________________________
    | MS Guy: Nope. I'm not. |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    So, specificity matters to him.
    _________________________
    | MS Guy: Yup. It does. |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Well, alright MS Guy... 
    Maybe PowerShell and CSharp aren't exactly the same. 
    ________________________
    | MS Guy: They're not. |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    But, if they use the same components, then they have similarities that aren't readily apparent.
    ____________________________________
    | MS Guy: I can agree with that... |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    So, if that's the case, some EXPERIMENTATION and EXPANDING upon those OBSERVATIONS/SIMILARITIES, will inevitably 
    evoke (strengths/weaknesses) of one over the other, as they all find their way into processes that people hadn't 
    used before... 
    ________________________
    | MS Guy: Interesting. |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    At least, not until some dude with his obnoxiously written section headers had his sights on a checkered flag 
    somewhere in the future. Somewhere. Cause, so is the guy from Microsoft. The both of these two dudes, day in, 
    day out... constantly looking for an edge in performance. Waiting for the day that they'd be first person to blast 
    past that checkered flag.

    Probably never... right? 
    But, people do it all the time. 
    I could provide many, many examples, but I'm going to whip out one pretty specific example... 
    When Microsoft combined Edge and Chrome.
    
    Google originally made Google Chrome.
    Microsoft originally made Internet Explorer.
    Commodore originally made the Commodore64. 
    Paul Allen and Bill Gates made BASIC for the Altair 8800.

    The point, a lot of people have made stuff... and when everyone kept saying "This is the best",
    Well, somebody said "I can do better than that. Check this out..." Boom. New version of Basic.

    Paul Allen and Bill Gates spent a fortune renting access to the supercomputers back in the 70's.
    Look what they started...?

    Microsoft has a very detailed history of "showing people how it's done..."
    Sometimes they'll roll up their sleeves when they say this. 
    Other times, they're done before they even have the chance to roll up their sleeves. 

    So, they don't even say anything... Job's done.
    
    Anyway, this is what they did to Google Chrome... 
    They went ahead and improved Google Chrome.
    
    Just like they do to everything they decide to do. 
    Not really sure why people are shocked by it, but they have a really long history of just going right ahead, 
    and making something even better.
    
    Some people might say "How DO they manage to do that?"
    Well, the answer is because they have the best software engineers in the world, and...
    ...the world's best software is engineered at One Microsoft Way, Redmond WA 98052. 
    Always has been.
    
    That's cause they invented the idea of software. So, when they decide to do something...?

    So then the kid whips out the napkin that he drew the idea onto.
    The napkin's all crumpled up, but that's ok... 
    New kid was able to open the napkin, remember the idea, and then he races over to the whiteboard. 
    All these other ideas are on the whiteboard, but he knows he's got the answer they've been looking for...
    So he erases everything and starts from scratch.

    Some of his teammates start to get WICKED PISSED, but the boss man interjects... tells em all to shush.
    New kid starts drawing it all up. 
    The boss man intently watches, so does everybody else.

    They knew that the math worked out before even writing a single line of code. 
    They knew it could achieve some mysterious objective where it outperformed all of the ideas on their idea board. 

    After 2 days go by, they finally have it ready to compile, so that their oceans of virtual machine hive clusters

$Book.AddSection(11,"Continued, Language Construction/Similarities (Object-Oriented vs. Functional vs. String-based)",@"
    Some may say that PowerShell is a functional language, but it really is a lot more than that.
    I suppose for the people that only know how to use commands that come with the operating system, then it's pretty 
    easy to think PowerShell is just a functional language.
    
    However, PowerShell is an Object-Oriented language, just like CSharp is...

    At least, whenever you do more than just use the default commands and functions.
    Bash or (tsch/TCShell), are more FUNCTIONAL based, or even heavily STRING based.
    ¯¯¯¯     ¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Mainly because the output is a "stream" of individual bytes masked with characters...
    ...characters marked with encoding...
    ...encoding indexed with integers...
    ...collections of integers being thrown into floating point calculations...
    ...rounding the floating point calculations into percentages...
    ...then doubles getting calculated by multi-tiered hex values... 

    Now, all of these things happen in CSharp and PowerShell too... but in PS? 
    EVERYTHING is either a single [OBJECT], or multiple [OBJECTS[]].
    
    If it's a single [OBJECT]? 
    Well, it could definitely be VERY detailed. 
    But, it could also be a list or a collection of objects. 
    
    In that collection, each of those objects has an entire collection of properties. 
    Properties may contain single values, or multiple values. 
    Values can actually be subproperties, keys, or additional values. 
    Sometimes there may even be multiple objects that just so happen to be marked as values... 
    ...within a single property.
    
    Then, you'll have to face yourself in the mirror. "They could go on infinitely inward, huh?"
    
    Yeah. 
    They could. 
    Because, if there ARE values that represent objects, then... there may be some recursive action going on, 
    almost like Horton Hears a Who.
    
    Then what...? 
    You might have an entire arsenal of nested objects each with THEIR own properties.
    Each of those objects might have properties which hold a value of an additional object...
    
    Probably sounds confusing... 
    Objects, properties, values... 

    But, values can be nested objects.
    Those nested objects might even have many properties with single values, or multiple values.
    
    Now you probably have no idea if I'm stating things metaphorically, or specifically... do you?
"@)

$Book.AddSection(11,"Quantum Physics, Entanglement, and Superposition",@"
    The truth is, I could be stating one of those things. 
    Or, the other.

    However, what could ALSO be the truth, is that it really could be BOTH things simultaneously.
    Or, neither of em. 

    That's how quantum physics, entanglement, and superposition explain reality.
    If that idea stretches your imagination a little too far...? Heh.

    PowerShell can keep on going buddy. 
    Now, wrap your head around THAT.

    Whether NESTED OBJECTS contain VALUES that just so happen to be MORE NESTED OBJECTS...? 
    ...each with their own PROPERTIES and VALUES... the truth is, you really COULD go on for seemingly eternity,

    Nesting objects within values...
    ...values within properties... 
    ...properties within an object...

    Before you know it... you'll realize that basically PowerShell has a lot more control than string based languages. 

    That's why recursion is... mind boggling. 
    CSharp has this control too, but... kinda needs to be planned out, to control it. 
    
    PowerShell is built around the concept of DYNAMIC, and thus, has a LOT more FLEXIBILITY.
    It does have it's own limitations as well, but there's a happy medium...
    Combining the strengths of CSharp and PowerShell is a process I continually conceptualize and expand upon.

    Also, string based languages aren't capturing objects with their properties and values recursively inward, not 
    unless a program is running and happens to be doing that, but chances are, that the program is outputting some 
    text based derivative, like (stdout/Standard Out).

    Whether that is/isn't the case, a master programmer has to build a construct that manages to do all of that, 
    without breaking, or throwing an error. So, a master programmer has to be extremely considerate, and build the 
    proper classes, set the proper constants, intialize the correct keys, and use mathematical models to build all 
    of it... Or, they could just hope they get lucky.

    They have to keep in mind how many nested objects, properties, and values might be in there, lurking beneath 
    the surface of it all. Because if they don't...?  Well, the whole program will inevitably break apart, crash, 
    or shut down. Then it won't be a program anymore... It'll be an error. Or, a long list of errors. 

    Can't exactly call it a program if it doesn't work...

    Suffice to say, this programmer, this keyboard warrior, whatever you want to call them...
    ...they have to find a way to perform such an impossible task, one that can contain every class, object, property, 
    and value... and if it goes in additional levels... well, what then, buddy...?

    These are all of the things a developer has to keep in mind... all so that the the normal every day person can 
    keep their sanity and wits. Probably doesn't sound fair, does it?

    Them...? Thinking about how to reliably count the number of stars in the universe, and not break.
    You...? Probably just getting a coffee at Starbucks to start your day.
"@)

$Book.AddSection(11,"Doing the Impossible",@"
    If that just blew your mind...? Sorry. 

    It's easy to get carried away with how much control there is, especially when just casually stating these words 
    in a single sentence: "objects, properties, values, recursively, eternity" causes the speaker to start thinking 
    about fractals, Rosen-Einstein bridges/condensates, Mandlebrot sets, and this guy:

    None of these things are really REQUIRED to build a program, or understand (PowerShell/any other language) but, 
    they definitely help. Before I started getting carried away in explaining how PowerShell is FAR MORE than just a
    functional language...?

    Well, what I was alluding to is that a FUNCTIONAL language isn't exactly DESCRIPT about CONTROL over OBJECTS,
    PROPERTIES, and VALUES... An OBJECT-ORIENTED language IS, as every component may need to be able to be 
    calculated, translated, and duplicated with precision.

    The possibilities don't stop there, either. But, Allow me to return to the subject of:

    You would not believe how many things this smart bastard, BILL GATES predicted WAAAAY back in 1995...
    Not only is he a smart bastard, but he's also a BILLionaire. One of the coolest ones out there, too. Side point.

    Cisco routers & switches (or really, ANY good brand), use tsch.
    Shocker, right...? Cisco networking devices using an operating system like tsch...?
    No way...
    That's impossible...
    
    I'm just kidding. It is possible. It's what DELL, HP, even UBIQUITY, maybe RUCKUS, or thousands of other 
    brands actually use to FLASH the FIRMWARE on those NETWORK DEVICES. Tsch.
    USER CONFIGURATION MODE and then GLOBAL/ADMINISTRATION MODE...
    ...is like comparing NON-WHEEL to WHEEL in Bash/Linux.
 
    While BASH isn't nearly as old as tsch, it takes a lot of inspiration from it.
    Bash comes from the very widely authored realm of Unix/Linux/BSD.

    And, not all Bash shells are created equal...
    Many old (DOS/CMD/COM) based components are ALSO string based.

    COM objects ARE CMD components, but- with the added kick of having some new functionality, since some wizards had 
    the wireframe schematics, they chiseled in new accessiblility for PowerShell.
    
    Java and Python are BOTH string based, AND class/object based. Java/CSharp are VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL...
    ¯¯¯¯     ¯¯¯¯¯¯          ¯¯¯¯¯¯ ¯¯¯¯¯      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    ...though, I mean that in terms of how the SYNTAX, as well as how code is constructed.
    Most programming languages have SIMILAR SYNTAX, but making comparisons between them CAN be TIME CONSUMING.

    Saying programming languages are IDENTICAL or VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL comes with some CAVEATS.
    Typically, they're definitely NOT EXACTLY the same. 
    Because, saying that would be ridiculous. 

    But, in appearance, logical construction, and format... it's pretty easy to see how SIMILAR they are.
    Python, is quite a different beast than anything else, but- it is very similar to standard C.
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯                                  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Standard C has not a single (+/plus), nor two of them (++), nor does it have a (#/sharp).
    That's what Python is, except it can do a lot more cool stuff than Standard C can.

    Python is ALSO a very good language, very extendable, flexible, powerful and capable, but it is
    not even remotely as flexible, powerful or capable as PowerShell... because it requires setup,
    multiple components to install, and its console experience is rather detached from the script
    editing. Unless you have a compiled executable. But, if it's an executable, then it doesn't
    matter if you have the tools or devkits installed to build with it... it's ready to run.

    If we're gonna grasp straws, PowerShell Core requires all of that on Linux/MacOSX/BSD too.
    So, if you're using Linux or Mac OSX, THEN... Python is a GREAT choice. But, so is PowerShell.
    On Windows, you have access to PowerShell Desktop AND Core. Then, it isn't much of a question.

    All jokes aside, Python IS extremely powerful.
    It's nothing to sneeze at.
    It can outperform PowerShell AND CSharp in many instances...
    
    But- does Microsoft use it more than CSharp or PowerShell? 
    Pretty sure that's a NEGATIVE. 

    If they're not using CSharp, they may use C++ if anything. 
    That doesn't mean they WON'T use Python...?
    Cause they will.

    I've gotten my hands dirty with Python, IF THAT ISN'T RATHER OBVIOUS...
    But- translating how I program in PowerShell to Python requires me to have to SPEND MORE TIME FIGURING THINGS
    OUT... And that's the CLINCHER HERE. Time. Investment in TIME, matters in EVERY REAL WORLD APPLICATION.

    Someday I will use Python interchangably with PowerShell AND CSharp...?
    But- they're not gonna be as flexible as PowerShell (in my opinion).

    As for the folks at Microsoft...? 
    Perhaps some of them occasionally dabble and moonlight with some Python script kiddies, as it has seen a lot 
    of increased popularity recently, but- so has PowerShell. 

    All things considered, Python has some strengths that aren't anything to joke about at all.
    
    But- it is:
    - very taxing to keep up to date unless you're very involved in maintenance
    - has security issues quite often as it is open source
    - very susceptible to CVE's after each version has been distributed
     
    I know this because I use a derivative of FreeBSD for Security Gateway appliances, like pfSense/OPNsense.
    I thoroughly enjoy the CHALLENGE of using these platforms to provide ENTERPRISE GRADE NETWORK SECURITY.
    It's much more DIFFICULT than using something that COSTS A LOT OF MONEY and is DEVELOPED BY CISCO.

    If I had mountains of cash to burn...?
    That is the equipment I would purchase and use... because CISCO IS THE BEST THERE IS.
    SIDE POINT.

    Python is the most targeted codebase by far. Maybe I'm wrong, ECMA/JavaScript, PHP and OpenSSL get hit hard too.

    But, I see basically every version of Python getting hit with CVE's, more than anything else.
    It's harder to maintain cross-compatibility AND security, if you release an update for Python...
    ...and within 1 hour of that update being distributed, there's a brand new CVE. 

    Then the next version will need a few days at a bare minimum... to bug test and write. 
    While Python is GOOD in many cases, I think it is basically DOS on steroids. 
    I'm sure that's an OVERSIMPLIFICATION, but Python causes me to FEEL as if, it is the same thing that COM/CMD is.

    Now, bringing it all back to comparing and contrasting with CSharp, since that's where this started.

    CSharp isn't your standard issue, do-it-in-a-jiffy type of programming language... Nah.
    It requires a LOT more meticulousness than PowerShell, as it is specifically, and strongly typed.

    Whereas PowerShell allows the common lad to relax a bit. Cause... PowerShell knows just how high
    CSharp sets its requirements. Consistently high too. 
    That's how I know PowerShell was designed from the ground up by some guys at Microsoft who looked at each other 
    one day, and said:

              And then, Google and Oracle just, non-stop...
              ...wind up using it more than WE will.

    I would say it is sort of akin to asking General Motors if they know how to make a GOOD vehicle that doesn't

    The problem is that they will never actually do that.

    So, Microsoft selling PowerShell is a lot like General Motors making a good electric vehicle.
    It's unfathomable. 

    The truth is, General Motors has made FAR MORE electric vehicles... than any other car company on the planet. 
    They just don't have any incentive to make them all that *well*. 

    I'm sure if they tried, they could definitely make these things as well as Tesla does...?
    But, I might be fooling myself OR OTHERS, by making a statement like that...

    The problem is, finding any reason at all, to convince them to do such a thing.

    I'm sure if you twisted Microsoft's arm, they could sell PowerShell and then build something to replace it. 
    But, they're not gonna do that, just like General Motors will never make a good electric vehicle that uses 
    NO GASOLINE, whatsoever. It actually cannot be expected, at any time.

    GM has ALMOST made a good electric vehicle many, many times... but each time those "vehicles" ALMOST made it 
    to market... they somehow *vanished*.

    GM   : Here kids, watch this highly rated electric vehicle get 400 miles per charge...
          *Kids wait around for like a year*
    Kids : Hey, GM... where's that highly rated electric vehicle that gets 400 miles per charge...?
    GM   : It'll be out next year. 
           Had a few issues.
    Kids : What kind of issues...?
    GM   : Burning through R&D cash reserves, researching how to make good batteries n stuff.
    Kids : But, Tesla has been doing it for a while now...
    GM   : That's Tesla though.
    Kids : But, you guys get so many awards for the best vehicles in the industry...
    GM   : Gasoline powered. 
           That's why.
    Kids : Thought you guys could make electric vehicles that were competetive...
    GM   : Hell no, kids. 
           We just SAY stuff like that to SOUND like we're experts.
    Kids : That's... messed up. 
           So, does the vehicle which gets 400 miles per charge exist...?
    GM   : On paper it most certainly does.
    Kids : On paper...? 
           What does that even mean?
    GM   : It means that we printed a piece of paper with the facts and figures of this thing.
           It definitely exists alright. 
           We just ran out of EV R&D money and built more gas cars.
    Kids : So, why even tell people you're building an electric vehicle at all...?
    GM   : Look kids. 
           We would really prefer to build gasoline cars. 
           That's what we do best.
    Kids : But, what will you do when all of the oil on the planet is gone...?
    GM   : We'll worry about it then, alright...? 
           Now, scram. 
           I need to go take a nap.
    Kids : Wow. 
           I've never met such an obnoxious magician in my entire life.
    GM   : Look, I feel bad. 
           Here's some pictures of the 2022 Chevy Corvette.
    Kids : It does LOOK cool, but-
    GM   : No, it's not electric powered.
    Kids : Then, why would anyone want this thing...?
    GM   : WHAT DO YOU MEAN, why would anyone want this thing...? 
           It's got a lot of horsepower...
    Kids : Does it have as much horsepower as the Tesla Model S Plaid...?
    GM   : ...no.
    Kids : How much does it cost...?
    GM   : Like, `$120K.
    Kids : I could buy a Tesla Model S Plaid for that much.
    GM   : LISTEN KIDS... 
           All you guys wanna do, is talk about the Model S Plaid, don't ya...?
    Kids : Yeah. 
           It's cooler looking, and WAY faster than this *hand wavin' around* 2022 Chevy Corvette...
    GM   : But, ACTUAL experts designed this thing... 
           We invested a lot of R&D money into it.
    Kids : Weird. 
           Actual experts made something that uses gasoline and is still slower than the Tesla Model S Plaid...? 
           Doesn't make a lot of sense there Mr. Magician...
           Probably could've spent that money making an electric car. 
           But, a GOOD one.
    GM   : Could've, should've, would've. 
           So what...?
    Kids : Maybe you guys just aren't very good at making cars anymore...
    GM   : *scoffs* We'll ALWAYS be good at making cars there kids. 
           Don't be ridiculous...
    Kids : C'mon guys, lets go.

    Now, would GM ever openly state these things...? 
    No, because that'd be WAY too honest...

    Besides, they could've used that bailout check that they got, to finally do right by the American people, in the 
    form of making GOOD vehicles, right here in America.

    But, *checks watch* they, still haven't gotten around to it. 
    I wonder why that is...
    
    Much like how Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity have NEVER been interesting to watch...?
    GM hasn't been an interesting vehicle manufacturer, since... like, WAAAAY back in the 80's, or the 70's.
    Basically BEFORE Bob Lutz began to run General Motors, that's when General Motors was actually respectable.

    Microsoft doesn't have this issue where they perform magic tricks or tell stories...
    Well, let me rephrase that... They perform magic tricks that are SKILLFULLY executed, not TERRIBLY executed.
    Not only do THEY know how real climate change is, but they never sound moronic, like, ever.

    Also..? 
    If they say they're gonna do something, or they say they know HOW to do something, then... they *definitely* 
    keep to their word. No "vaporware" like GM and their electric cars.
    
    When General Motors and AIG needed a bailout check after Bear Sterns got wiped out of existence...?
    Microsoft didn't need one at all. 
    Might be because Steven Ballmer never put the company in a position to ever NEED one... 

    Ballmer worked his ass off to make so many good things and ideas.

    Tae had some SERIOUS issues with using racial slurs, after it was launched. 
    Then it had to be taken offline...

    Ballmer had A LOT of STIFF COMPETITION as the CEO of Microsoft...

    Even STILL... Ballmer never asked Obama for a bailout check. And, that says a million words.

    The truth is, in a similar way to how GM would never be caught dead making a good electric car, these experts 
    at Microsoft would never even think about selling their 1) kids, nor 2) PowerShell.

    I won't lie, I haven't ALWAYS had a consistently good opinion in reference to Mr. Ballmer's engagement policies.

    Already read a good portion of “The Road Ahead”, and that was ALSO a good book...
    So, the tale of rediscovering one's self or sense of purpose... it's like a similar mission among experts everywhere.

    Did Bob Lutz write a book or win a Pulitzer prize for running General Motors for 50 years...?
    Nah.

    So, the comparison with General Motors doesn't even really compare... 
    Bob Lutz would have to be humbled enough and finally ask Elon Musk for advice on: 
    "how to make a good vehicle that doesn't use any gasoline". 

    I know that General Motors has SOME EV's out there now that SUPPOSEDLY keep up with Teslas...?
    But I think the FACTS and FIGURES are ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED...
    Not to mention, it took Tesla reaching MASS PRODUCTION before General Motors said to themselves...
    ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
    | Alright, so we REALLY need to make some decent electric vehicles now, ffs. ← LAZINESS in American auto industry |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    I'd be happy with Lutz even learning how to make a GOOD gasoline powered car, where the PARTS aren't made with 
    INTENTIONAL DESIGN FLAWS. I mean, let's face it...

    Anyone could buy a European car, and that will automatically be worth more than any American car. Right off the lot. 
    It doesn't LOSE as much value as an American car. Why?
    
    Because them Germans and Italians are a LOT better at making cars, than Americans (except for Tesla). Seriously.
    Even the Koreans, Japanese, and Chinese folks can make HIGHER QUALITY VEHICLES for LESS MONEY.

    What that actually means, is that people in America don't really care if they do a good job. Some Americans 
    take offense to this... “Yeah, America sucks at making quality vehicles.”, and I don't know why – it's TRUE.
    They SHOULD be getting offended by people that don't pay any attention to the mistakes they make, because 
    they ultimately cost everybody even more in the long run.

    I really shouldn't say anything negative about Ford or even Daimler-Chrysler, cause it's not exactly their 
    fault that they don't make MOST American cars. The ones they DO make, are typically better than anything GM 
    makes, hands down. 

    Here's what GM does very well... Selling things that break.
    Selling things that BREAK is DEFINITELY a LUCRATIVE business- GM is the best there is, at THAT.

    That really isn't something you really want people to consider your company to be the BEST at...
    ...because it means YOUR company is the BEST at making something TERRIBLY DESIGNED.

    That's the beginning and the end of that conversation.
    But, maybe that's just my opinion. 

    They found success selling convoys of vehicles that get thrown together with parts that someone intentionally 
    made poorly. Because, if it breaks a lot? That generates more profit, and to them, if it generates more profit 
    because it broke more often, then that is actually a genius plan. 

    So, their eating-leaded-paint-chips mentality, where they made more money, caused them to believe they did an 
    AMAZING job. But- stupidity will do that to ya... 

    Those automatic window controllers need to be replaced every other winter on one of the doors.
    Doesn't matter if you had the driver rear door fixed last year, what matters is that this year, the OTHER one 
    will ALSO suddenly break. You might feel like the boogeyman is just swinging around from one part to the next, 
    randomly breaking these things. 

    Heh. That's what they're very good at making people think. 
    Now that the OTHER rear window motor is broken...? 
    Each time you drive it in the winter, you'll feel like your air conditioner is on.
    But, that's mainly cause the rear window motor is broke, and the window is wide open. 
    
    So, that real familiar blast of arctic air you feel...? It's genuine. 
    Because... you're like everyone else who owns a GM vehicle. 
    You: "There's no way that they make this car to break like this..." 

    Yeah there is, actually.
    They don't actually care how ignorant the manner of generating more profit is, what matters is whether the 
    garbage they made generates a net profit at any cost whatsoever. Even the Germans would never do something this 
    moronic to something they put a lot of time, and effort into.
    
    GM just does not care about the customer's opinion at all... 
    Even if you are really cool or, important. 
    Why...? 

    As soon as the really important person says something to their buddy, someone at GM will wait for that person 
    to leave, and the moment they shut the door, they'll say: 

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    GM : Yeah right pal. 
         Stop making terrible parts that break a lot...? 
         *chuckles* Heh.
         YEAH RIGHT, DUDE...
         Take a hike. 
         There's just no real money in making cars that don't constantly break down. 
         My grandfather tried that for like 50 years... he was constantly broke. 
         Now look at him.
         That dude may have built this company with his bare hands...? 
         But- if he had only figured out how to source consistently lower quality parts that break more often...? 
         He would've been a billionaire.

    Me      : But- it was made by General Motors... 
              Right...?
    FBI Guy : Yeah.
    Me      : WELL, if GM made it, then there IS a way that it's burning oil, because... 
              ...EVERY GM vehicle does that. 

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    So, someone who thinks they're driving a good vehicle, they'll give the manufacturer the benefit of a doubt 
    because of how much money they spent on it. With a name like General Motors, the more money people spend, the 
    more innocent they look. But, the oil filters will ALWAYS have a slight groove on the thread where the filter 
    screws into place and that's right where the oil starts to leak/burn, so the truth is:
   
    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Me : Nah, it's not burning oil...
         It's just burning AND leaking oil. 
         Big difference. 
         When it DOESN'T leak...? 
         It burns. 
         When it DOESN'T burn...? 
         It'll just leak. 
         Can't have one without the OTHER... 
         And that's the best of qualty General Motors craftsmanship.
         Straight-up Bob Lutz 101.

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    The reason why it sounds ridiculous, is because sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction.
    There's a combination of leakage AND burning occurring simultaneously. 
    Maybe it only happens on (7/8) GM vehicles, and the (1/8) vehicles that doesn't leak...? 
    Well... it just BURNS the oil FASTER than it can leak. 
    So, someone might try to tell me that makes them an exception. 

    But, it doesn't.
    Literally 100% of their vehicles do this. 
    I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I'VE OWNED LIKE A DOZEN VEHICLES MADE BY GENERAL MOTORS.
    THEY ARE ALL POORLY MADE <ON PURPOSE>.

    They don't make a single vehicle that doesn't burn oil, or doesn't leak.
    Wanna know why...?
    Because then people BUY MORE OIL.

    Suppose someone actually asked GM executives,
    "Hey, do all GM vehicles leak/burn oil...?" 

    Cause I'll tell you right now, they will say no, and if you ask them to PROVE it...? 
    They will say: “We're too busy.”

    That's cause they're not busy at all, and they just lied about whether their vehicles all burn/leak oil. 
    That's how they operate. The truth is, it doesn't matter WHO spends WHAT amount. If a GM vehicle is involved 
    when someone smells oil or something burning,...? 

    That's because the engine of that vehicle is doing just that.
    Believe it or not, but a Chevrolet Impala, uses the same exact chassis as a Cadillac CTS.

    Even if the Cadillac has leather seats and a much more powerful engine... after 20K miles? 
    WELL, the transmission will OCCASIONALLY start SLIPPING into 3rd gear. 

    Why? Uh, intentional design flaw, helps to make certain that the transmission is on track to fall out 
    RIGHT AFTER the warranty expires. If you think I'm kidding, I'm not. I might sound like I'm making some of 
    this stuff up, but the only thing I am making up are these various conditions... 

    Every vehicle has these problems INTENTIONALLY implemented. 
    My 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix had a 3.8L V6, bumper to bumper warranty, and when driving the vehicle, my car would 
    make these POPPING noises every time I would hit the accelerator, and then again when I'd hit the brakes. 

    That's because the dealership I bought the vehicle from, Bill Cass' Northstar Chevrolet...? 
    They had ASE certified technicians for sure.
    They would CLAIM to have done work on my vehicle. 

    BUT- when I'd leave, the NOISE was actually STILL there. 
    They would give me an EXTREMELY DETAILED LOADOUT of ALL the “work” they SUPPOSEDLY did... right...?
    But I would still hear the god damn noise that prompted me into bringing the vehicle in for service.
    
    So, I kept saying to myself

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Me : What if they're not actually doing any work on my vehicle...? 
         Every single time I bring it in for warranty work...
         ...it has the same exact problems it did before I dropped it off. 
         Virtually identical...
    
    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    Then when you ACCUSE them of not doing the work, they'll try to make you feel bad like:
    
    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    That person is trying to blame YOU for being RIGHTFULLY pissed off at THEM, for lying to you.
    I was just TOO YOUNG to realize that I should CAPITALIZE on my GUT INSTINCTS like that, because so many people 
    make a living off of being COMPLETELY DISHONEST. This would include the POLICE, LAWYERS, JUDGES, and DOCTORS.

    That's because I was charged for a warranty that they made no effort to provide. 
    They SAID that they did all of this work (allegedly), but if the vehicle still makes the SAME NOISES before it 
    got dropped off, and continues to make those same exact noises AFTER it's picked up...? 

    WELL...

    Bill Cass' Northstar Chevrolet
    I mean even ITT Technical Institute got involved in this charade too...

    Don't get me wrong here, it's not like ALL of the people at GENERAL MOTORS are involved.
    Most of their employees aren't intelligent enough to know that the people who OWN the company, they do this.
    Same goes with many of the employees at ITT Technical Institute, they may not have been intelligent enough 
    to know that their COMMERCIALS, and STUDENT LOAN PROGRAMS were basically committing PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES.

    That's just how the game called “AMERICA” is played, my friends.

    Yeah. That's right. Some people don't care if you catch them lying to you, as long as they LOOK
    like they are a trustworthy person, they can 1) say, or 2) do whatever.

    As for GENERAL MOTORS, my engine needed to be replaced at 107K miles, just 7K miles outside of the warranty.
    Wanna know how much that cost me...? About $6,000. I paid for that, too.
    THEN, at 130K miles...? Transmission fell out. Another $6,000 right there. I paid for that too.

    So it just goes to show that DEALERSHIPS and GENERAL MOTORS are LYING SCUMBAGS sometimes.

    I sorta told these useless bastards at Northstar that the vehicle had some problems. One guy once said to me:

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Alex : Sometimes a vehicle just, it gets in an accident or something...? 
           And, it never drives right after that.
    (that dude may as well have said...)
    Alex : It's not actually gay if you're like me, and you put another mans' penis in your mouth...

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    ...and it would've been JUST AS CREDIBLE of a statement. To be fair...? I don't think the dude did that.
    I'm just saying, if that dude wasn't such a lazy, lying cocksucker... I would've paid off the vehicle and gotten
    maybe 280K miles on the vehicle BEFORE it needed a BRAND NEW ENGINE OR TRANSMISSION...

    But, because he WAS a lazy, lying cocksucker...? Then I had to SHELL OUT AN ADDITIONAL $12K.
    For a vehicle that originally cost $17K.
    Almost like it was a TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY.

    It's not like I have something against a dude who prefers to do that, sucking some other dude's dick...
    ...but it's too much information for the given situation... Ya know...?

    I told this dude that my engine AND transmission kept making strange vibrating noises, and he's trying to tell 
    me about his sexual fantasies... Doesn't make a whole lot of sense, right...? 

    An ASE certified technician from Northstar Chevrolet, named Alex...? 
    But, surprisingly, everyone thought he was cool as all hell. 
    I thought he was an idiot that PRETENDED to do actual work, and my god, I was correct after all.
    Northstar Chevrolet has been LONG GONE... for a pretty critical reason.
    
    Anyway, had this feeling for a loooong time, that the engine and the transmission had serious issues. 
    I felt the transmission making some strange vibrations when it had like, 29K on it. 
    All the way til 130K when the transmission died on me too. Still had another year of payments to make on it.

    But guess what...? 
    GM sucks at making cars. 
    They make ok trucks, but even they break down a lot.
    
    My friend had a 2005 Chevy Silverado, guess what failed in it about a year before he was done paying it off...? 
    ...the engine. Yeah. I don't know why people say they make good stuff, especially when their AWESOME DEPENDABLE
    VEHICLE just so happens to ALSO break down frequently.

    So, not only do they suck at making cars, but they also suck at providing necessary services for the warranties.
    Almost as if they're a TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.

    Because if you're like me, you'll notice that they don't actually do any work.
    I actually feel bad for the dude Andy, because I actually believed him, but sometimes even with him, 
    I'd get the damn car back and magically, I would realize that if they did something at all,
    it was barely noticeable. 

    They probably did do PORTIONS of the things they told me they did, but I spent an additional $12K on:

    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Each time, I had a feeling that they literally charged me a LOT more money to do NO ADDITIONAL SERVICE to my 
    vehicle. I financed a $17K car, and wound up paying about $35K when all was said and done with replacing the 
    engine 3.5 years in, and then the transmission 6 months later. 

    Still owed another 18 months worth of payments when I had to shell out $5K for a new engine. 
    Then 12 months left when the transmission failed, that was an additional $6K. 
    I chose to buy this vehicle because I had hoped that buying a new car from a dealership, was a good idea.
    Turns out that it was one of the WORST ideas I've ever had...

    So, I realize people might say "Why do you seem to think Bob Lutz is the problem...?"

    It's literally cause he was the director of GM for about 50 years, and ALL of my GM vehicles have had similar 
    problems. Something ridiculous...? Bob Lutz probably had something to do with the LINE being drawn through the
    ENGINEERING BLUEPRINTS somewhere.

    Sometimes the high beam switches are like $400 bucks, and they'll break after like the first 15K miles. 
    Bob Lutz probably told everybody that makes them, 

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Lutz : Hey, use cheap plastic, but... keep charging for like gold plated ones. 
           That'll show everybody...

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    What I've realized, is that in order to purchase a GOOD vehicle that GM claims to have made, it has to have been 
    made in some totally different continent, for instance, Australia. The Pontiac G8 was a really sweet car. But, 
    Bob Lutz had NOTHING TO DO with THAT vehicle being made. Nah.
    
    HOLDEN, in AUSTRALIA, actually made it. 
    GM took credit for building it, cause why not...? 
    The 2003+ Pontiac GTO and the Pontiac G8 were both made in Australia. 
    Not America. 
    That's the ONLY reason why they were both REALLY GOOD cars. 

    Now, had they been made here in the United States...? 
    Then, they would've never been as well made.

    You gotta figure, even vehicles that wind up getting fitted with bulletproof glass to protect former-governor 
    Cuomo, the former governor of New York that somehow had 11 women accuse him of something he supposedly would 
    never do... 

    If GM made that thing...? 
    It's got many design flaws too.
    Maybe if you throw a tennis ball at Cuomo's Yukon Denali, it could cause the transmission to fall out. 

    So, throwing it into 4-wheel drive, and going off roading with it, it's a pretty extreme activity... 
    ...it'll be engineered WELL for a task just like that... 
    But- a properly thrown tennis ball that hits the right spot, will cause that transmission to immediately fail.
    
    Then what...? 
    Dude was just going off-roading and won a championship amongst hundreds of other dudes off-roading in THEIR
    trucks... But as soon as the trophy girl placed the FIRST PLACE TROPHY on the HOOD of the truck...? Ah man...
    The truck was revving it's engine alright, but now the transmission appears to have fallen out... it's not
    goin' into gear anymore.

    A lot of people will overlook stuff like that, a (little tennis ball/trophy) versus a $12K transmission... 
    ...the (tennis ball/trophy) somehow wins. At that point it's MORE than just dumb luck.

    Maybe the hood won't stay up, the hydraulic pumps that are supposed to automatically hold the hood up, they 
    have a seal that breaks because of a design flaw. They'll work for like 18 months reliably, and then magically 
    one day, the seals met a condition where they matched equilibrium with the environment. 

    After that point, it's gonna hit ya in the head. So, if you want the hood to stay up without the pole...?

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    GM  : That'll be $500 bucks.
    You : I don't wanna pay that.
    GM  : Don't wanna pay us $500...? 
          Oh. 
          Looks like you'll need that pole then, chump...

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    Even if people get them fixed, that's another $250 each, and they may last 18 months, if you're lucky. 
    But I have a WAY better idea... What if the people who made them, actually built them to last a lot longer than 
    that...? Ya know...? I would've thought that they could last like 10 years. Or more. 

    Sorta like parts on a German car, they like, last a LOT longer for some STRANGE reason.
    
    On a GM though...? Oh nos. 
    You get like 6 months max before something else falls apart.
    
    Sometimes they design brake rotors and calipers so that even a brand new set of brake pads will sound like the 
    pads are scraping the rotor, but that's because the calipers have a slight bend in the hydraulic line which is 
    meant to cause the brake pads to pinch in at a slight angle, and that causes the pads and rotors to get malformed 
    and start warping right off the bat, causing the vehicle to feel 'dog legged' when coming to a stop... 

    You'll say "I literally just changed the god damn brakes on this..." 
    But, they don't care. You need to buy more already...

    Or, else you're not cool in their book. 
    They were installed correctly, and the calipers are good.
    The problem is, they make these things poorly, rather consistently.

    While they really could make things easier on everybody...? 
    Well, making all of these things with no flaws implemented off the rip, puts less money in their pockets... 
    ...they don't like THAT... nobody does.

    So, as soon as they hear something like LESS MONEY...? 
    Their voice starts TRAILING OFF. 

    Cause you said something like LESS MONEY FOR THEM, and now they're trying to stay positive, drowning you out.
    LESS MONEY for them sounds like a traumatic experience. 
    They may even bawl at the eyes, just like Prince Andrew does when he sees the picture of him and Ms. Guiffre.
    Or Andrew Cuomo does when he sees the picture of him with Brittany Commisso. Ya know...?

    If their business isn't generating enough profit from parts made for that vehicle, then to them...?
    That means it was actually poorly designed. 

    If it gets better gas mileage, sustains an impact in an accident, way better than their typical vehicle, 
    AND it has NO recalls or defective parts...?
    They will actually consider that a failure on their part. 
   
    Yeah. 5-star crash safety rating...? 
    That's bad...

    These factors just don't generate the type of profit they would PREFER to see... 
    We're talkin', they look for any stupid flaw that seems to happen a lot... 
    ...and when they notice this problem being super widespread across their entire fleet of vehicles...? 

    They will actually track down that manufacturer and they'll offer to award them with a contract in order to 
    mass produce those defective parts.

    In order for a product to be successful in GM's eyes...? 
    It can only be considered successful if it breaks a lot. 
    If a car has a LOT of these parts, then they will HEAVILY promote that vehicle. 
    A lot of ridiculous things that suddenly go bad for next to no reason at all, they all get their hopes up. 
    Mainly because they have eyes for this kind of thing, Bob Lutz was the best in the industry at this task. 

    So, now they know a poorly developed part when they see one, and when OTHER car companies avoided using these 
    parts...? Well, that's pretty dumb for them to do. Because, General Motors will shake their heads and double down.

    Their eyes light up with delight. 
    They move heaven and earth to convince the part manufacturers, to “live a little”. 

    It has to be fairly believable when these parts "randomly" break, that it's no coincidence at all.
    Nah, you're just some psychotic individual to suggest something like that... that's why they're industry leaders.

    The sad truth is, that is why Bob Lutz was the director of GM for over 50 years. 
    He was very gifted at tracking down these terribly made parts, and then flooding every vehicle he could with 
    THOSE consistently terrible parts... It might sound ridiculous, but this dude actually has a lot more experience 
    than Elon Musk or Tesla, at making electric vehicles AND terrible cars.

    Even with Elon Musk AND Tesla BOTH having a LOT less experience than GM, Ford, or Daimler-Chrysler... 
    ...all of that is irrelevant. Why...? American car corporations worry more about profit, and less about the 
    quality of their products. With other corporations and industries, you get a lot less of an EVIL BASTARD vibe.

    Too worried about BURNING and LEAKING oil... not about GAS MILEAGE or SUSTAINABILITY. 
    The MORE MONEY they can CONVINCE people to WASTE...? The BETTER.
"@)

$Book.AddSection(11,"Climate Change",@"
    That means they have MORE to give to RUPERT MURDOCK, SEAN HANNITY, or TUCKER CARLSON, which works great for them. 
    To them...? 
    They don't care about wildfires.
    Nor the plastic in the oceans. 
    Nor the cancer people contract from exhaust and smog.
    Nor the many tornado outbreaks.
    Nor the flash floods.
    Nor the hurricanes.
    Nor the ocean levels rising. 

    Nah. 
    All of that stuff is a lot less important to them. 
    Actually, all of those things are A LOT LESS IMPORTANT, than these people, in their eyes. 
    So, if many animals and plant species keep going extinct...? 
    
    They obviously rationalize with themselves, that those animals or plants probably didn't have what it takes to 
    exist in THEIR world. Because they figure, if those animal or plant species were worth a damn, they'd still be
    around... and that's what they say to themselves. 
    Keeps em optimistic about the future...
    
    I realize, some people might think it's alarming that the car companies that keep building gas powered cars think 
    all of these things, but what's worse is how they say nothing or even deny it, when their ACTIONS CONSISTENTLY
    PROVE OTHERWISE. 

    To them, they just don't have what it takes to do what Elon Musk is doing with Tesla, it's called TALENT. 
    What Musk/Tesla is doing primarily considers that oil will eventually all run out. 

    If that happened TODAY, how screwed would we be? Very. 
    If we ran out of oil, right now? 
    A lot of people would die, very quickly. 

    So, if the world ran out of oil TODAY, the question then becomes, are we currently prepared for that much loss 
    of life...? Well, no. The Doomsday clock has been ticking the whole entire time, and people just have no earthly
    idea how close we are to an extinction level event. We cannot moderate ourselves, even the smartest people on 
    the planet have nothing at their disposal to restore order.
    
    So, then the question should really be, will GM still try to sell these 2022 Chevy Corvettes when there's no oil 
    or gas left...? Yep. They sure as hell will. They will know that there's no way to enjoy or do anything with a 
    vehicle that has a 20th century power source, gasoline. 

    So these idiots just keep making/selling the 2022 Chevy Corvette, even when ALL of the gas is gone. 
    Why...? I think it is because they're MENTALLY HANDICAPPED, because `$``$`$`$`$. 
    It's a PERFECT explanation... isn't it...?

    If they AREN'T MENTALLY HANDICAPPED, then my next best suggestion is that they should consider BUYING the 
    vehicle, instead of SELLING it... As the effort might allow them to catch on to how moronic the idea is. 
    Ya know...?

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Them : Hey, wanna buy a 2022 Chevy Corvette...? 
           It looks insanely cool.
           Oh wait, I gotta pretend to be the guy buying it... 
           Who's gonna sell it to me though...?
           Damnit. 
           Maybe this was actually a really stupid idea, to try and sell this car now...
           OoOhh, just sell myself a 2022 Chevy Corvette when there's no more gas left on the planet.
           How dumb am I...? 
           My god. 
           I can only imagine how many other people felt when I asked em...
           They probably thought. "Wow. This dude is a total moron... isn't he?"

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    Maybe everyone on the planet should consider that these people lie to themselves every single day. 
    Standard issue Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity. 
    They might say climate change isn't real, NOW, but later on when they're all alone... 
    ...and they realize that the weather is DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT than it used to be... 
    they'll have this startling idea...

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Them : You know... climate change probably WAS real that whole entire time and I was just some overpaid shill 
           whining on national television about everything...
           Ah, god. 
           That IS what I did. 
           Wow. 
           I feel like a complete idiot...

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    For the longest time, they invested so much energy into lying to themselves, now they're telling themselves the 
    truth, and it sounds so foreign. They didn't realize just how moronic they sounded to so many people... Not only 
    do they lie to themselves, but they lie to everyone else too. 

    That's because they lack the ability to tell a single truth about anything at all.
    If they COULD tell anybody the truth, they would've all decided to help Elon Musk build Tesla, and the batteries.
    Why not sooner...? Just cause. Gasoline used to be extremely abundant. And then one day, it'll ALL be gone.

    Why don't they do that, help an actual professional get the job done... ya know...?
    Well... it'd be wishful thinking, that's why...
    They're MENTALLY HANDICAPPED because of the ``$`$`$`$$, that's why.
    These people are in absolute denial to think OTHERWISE.

    Just like Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity say "climate change isn't real..."
    I'm not going to assume that they know any better, because they might not at all.
    You could SHOW THEM...? But- it's like trying to tell some MENTALLY HANDICAPPED person a joke.

    Sometimes you have to masterfully explain to some dude that gets paid millons of dollars every month, that all 
    the money they keep getting paid won't do them any good if the shit hits the fan, and they declare martial law... 
    Or, if they get themselves killed.
    Or, even both.

    Trying to make SUGGESTIONS to either of them, is bound to cause some confusion.
    As they may think someone is stating intent, rather than through the same sort of rhetoric they EACH use to 
    sound increasingly more moronic, each additional appearance they make... someone should tell them, it is a 
    true statement... doesn't matter who says it about anybody.
    
    It's still true. 
    From what I know about death, nobody has ever been able to live comfortably, and maintain their finances really 
    well, if at some point, they became a corpse. Ya know...?
    Corpses are NOT HISTORICALLY KNOWN, for making FINANCIALLY SOUND INVESTMENTS...
    If anything, they're a real DRAG to be around, might smell...?
    Might not look like they're doin' too well...?
    But that's because CORPSES are typically not alive to maintain their APPEARANCE or REPUTATION...

    Sorta puts a damper on being able to live comfortably... or manage finances. Or really, anything.
    But you know, it can't hurt for someone to use some poetry and descriptive scenes, in order to comfront their 
    own mortality from time to time. In reality, Steve Jobs did that quite a lot.

    He was a better presenter and public speaker, than these Fox boys ever were... and could phrase an entire life 
    story, as rhetoric... When he told people that he didn't want to be the richest guy in the graveyard, I'm pretty 
    sure he put a lot of thought into the phrase before he ever said those words out loud.

    So, even though the dudes on Fox News constantly spam people with THEIR rhetoric, they may not get it if someone 
    else does that same exact thing in return.

              I don't know what it is supposed to mean.
    Guy     : It means that if you're gonna do something phenomenal, go the full measure.
              Otherwise, people are gonna detect such a really poor choice when they (taste/smell) the dog shit
    Carlson : Alright. 
              I can see how that makes sense.
    Guy     : Yeah, but like usual, you needed to have it explained to you to have an opinion about something.
    Carlson : ...I have my own opinions sometimes...
    Guy     : Yeah. 
              You thought the metaphor was for not shitting where you eat...
    Carlson : It's a good bit of advice...
    Guy     : Why don't you follow something like that...? 
              Ya know...?

    Steve Jobs was a smart bastard for a number of reasons, not just cause he started Apple and invented the iPod, 
    iPhone, and iPad... though they definitely helped.
    
    He just truly didn't understand the sense of hoarding everything he could, and just keepin' all that stuff to 
    himself. Nah. Not him. He didn't care to be the richest man man in the graveyard...

    But- the quote really means that people can't use money if they get themselves killed.
    So, when someone does something for years in exchange for millions of dollars, and the shit his the fan...? 
    Then, people may no longer be able to purchase amenities, gas, supplies, or food.

               Can't be all THAT bad...
    Soldier1 : He's basically helpless. 
               Doesn't even have a weapon on him, nothin'.
               Not sure we can even trust him either...
               ...cause of how many times the man has lied on national broadcast television...
    Carlson  : I don't lie on Fox News.
    Soldier1 : Yeah, you most definitely do, and have, many times dipshit. 
               Now, shut your mouth.
    Soldier2 : What the hell was he doing out there, anyway...? 
               It's dangerous out...
    Soldier1 : Yeh. 
               This idiot thought he could spend his money whenever.
               Didn't realize money's no good now.
    Soldier2 : I mean, that's not completely true...
    Soldier1 : Yeah...? 
               Where could he go, right now, and spend that damn money of his...?
    Soldier2 : The army base sells supplies, still.
    Soldier1 : Ah yeh. 
               They'll still take this dudes' money, won't they...?
    Soldier2 : That is, if it's not stuck in his bank or something...
    Soldier1 : Is that true Tucker...? 
               You got real fat stacks of cash on hand somewhere...? 
               Hm...?
    Carlson  : *sniffles* Yeh. 
               I might.
    Soldier2 : How much you figure...?
    Carlson  : I've got a few million in cash-money.
               Some of the fattest stacks you'll ever lay your eyes on.
    Soldier1 : Like, for real...? 
               Not in the bank or whatever...?
    Carlson  : Yeah. 
               For real. 
               REAL fat stacks of cash...
    Soldier1 : Buddy... *turns to Soldier* 
               Dude might make himself useful after all...
               Get ourselves some weapons from the army supplies store...
    Soldier2 : We could try it. 
               It'll be dangerous...
    Soldier1 : Extra dangerous. 
               But, he's talkin' about some sky high stacks or somethin'
    Carlson  : How dangerous...?
               And I said some of the fattest stacks of cash you'll ever lay your eyes on...
               I didn't say sky-high stacks...
    Soldier1 : Dangerous to the point where you need a kevlar vest to be out the open, at a bare minumum, just to 
               stay alive.
               But I mean, if you've got some real fat stacks of cash layin' around,
               ...you could prolly use them, too....
    Carlson  : *sniffling* Yeah...? 
               Just use some straight-up cash, for body armor...?
    Soldier1 : I mean, it's definitely a better idea then gettin' shot dead by somebody's random bullet...
    Carlson  : *stops sniffling* I'm ready.
               Let's do this...
               I'm not gonna keep crying like a little girl.
    Soldier1 : Alright.
               You just earned some respect from me by sayin' that.

    Maybe none of these things will happen.
    Maybe everybody that pays all of their bills, and listens to Tucker Carlson, they do it because he's just a 
    floating voice that echoes and bounces off of the walls. Like a pinball.

    But, like an idiot... neither Carlson nor Hannity put much thought to climate change possibly showing up at 
    their doorstep someday. Maybe for most people, climate change felt like it COULD be one giant hoax, perpetuated 
    by all those PESKY SCIENTISTS that Carlson and Hannity basically undermined for years as they were handed some 
    of the fattest stacks of cash that anybody whose ever worked at Fox News, has ever been personally handed.

    They both lived the dream... being on modern every day network television.
    Repeating the gospels of fools, while also foreshadowing the certain inevitable arrival...
    ...of the day where everything began to fall apart.

    That's because, the day of reckoning finally arrived, with the skies torched and blackened, and the sun drowned 
    out like a faint glimmer in a seemingly endless void, an oasis in the desert... 

    Climate change was in everybody's face that whole entire time... it just had to roll up it's sleeves after the 
    day of reckoning finally came... Judgement Day.

    The question remains, what will that day actually bring forth...?
    Will it be hordes of angry mobs, each with a flaming pitchfork and a molotov cocktail...?
    Under martial law, seems pretty likely.

    Gotta say, I'd be terrified of even hearing about this story if I were either 1) Carlson, or 2) Hannity. 
    Why...? Cause I'm certain that some militia has been waiting for the day to visit em'.

    If it gets to that point, I am gonna feel bad for those guys.
    They're gonna have to face the music. It won't be very fun...
    ...and not a soul will be willing to protect these guys...
    ...even if they paid a security team a real nice fat stack of cash.

    Because the cash sorta loses it's appeal when the military/government officially declare a state of: MARTIAL LAW.

    Cause that's when they'll scatter like cockroaches and say "Ha. Never liked your ass anyway, bro."
    Then again, maybe not.
    
    Regardless, for the every day person who isn't a millionaire, even if you happen to be one...?
    Once MARTIAL LAW is declared, the state of the world immediately becomes a DREADED NIGHTMARE where MANY PEOPLE DIE.

    At that point, you better hope you have:

    If you don't, you'll already be basically dead. So many people will be caught in this box, and get killed.

    Money will eventually lose all of it's value if these things happen.
    Everything will spiral out of control so fast, people won't realize how grave the situation is...
    ...until it's too late.

    However, the truth is... Guys like Elon Musk exist, and, it stands to reason that he is the only person in the 
    world, who is working a lot harder than everybody else is, at preventing all of those nightmares from happening 
    in the first place. Though to be clear, he is FAR from the only one. Many people are ALSO helping.

    Still, all of those worst case scenarios could theoretically be completely avoided if people help him, but even 
    if people all jump on the bandwagon, start now, and act fast...? Time is very slim.
    
    There will come a day where people won't even care to complain about the car or oil industry anymore. 
    It'll just be a lot like the show "The Walking Dead".
    
    Everyone's just trying to survive.
    Groups of people sticking together, working in colonies, as one.
    Some aspects of normal life will try to seep back in...
    ...but society as we currently know it...?
    ...it'll be permanently gone.

    We could blame the American car and oil industry long before any of that happens...
    There ARE plenty of other industries to call out... but it all goes right back to GM, being a lousy magician...

    GM used to be the poster child for American car manufacturing, at least it used to be, about 40-50 years ago. 
    Then, this guy Bob Lutz came along.
    
    He's probably highly regarded by so many of the people that have come and gone...
    But, even the Germans and Italians over in Europe never really had the problem of being unable to make good cars.
    They were very surprised when Bob came along and just started making things a lot easier for the Europeans to 
    dominate the market. They just maintained the idea of "quality" and high standards.

    The word "quality" was just never a part of Bob Lutz vocabulary, not for 50 years.
    Not unless it was prefixed by the word "low".

    The one word by itself...? Oblivious. But together...?
    Heh. They were words that he lived by. Even today.

    "Low Quality" ... GM just became a totally different company after that. The Germans were intrigued by how 
    effortlessly this man made their lives, exporting vehicles to the United States.
    Even Marc from Marc's VM and Import Service saw how terribly made General Motors vehicles truly were...

    Since before the age of Hitler, even. 
    Germany has made nothing but good vehicles. 
    Even their most garbage vehicles last a LOT longer than American cars (unless it's a Tesla).

    The reason why, is because Bob Lutz really did change the entire market, single handedly.
    Europe is just a LOT MORE SKILLED at making dependable, durable, higher quality vehicles.

    Germany is awesome at it.
    Same with Italy, with their Ferarri's, Lambo's, Porsches... 

    If there's one word that describes European vehicles...? They're WELL MADE, or "Good". 
    "Bad" isn't really a word that ever comes up unless you start talking about American cars (unless it's a Tesla). 
    
    European vehicles are durable no matter how hard they try to screw them up.
    They're not PERFECT by any means, but... they're a hell of a lot more well made than American vehicles.

    That's saying something. Not only are they durable and last a long time...?
    But, they're also worth more money, like even if you bought one, and drove it off the lot.

    European cars lose a hell of a lot less value. 
    With an American car (unless it's a Tesla), it's as if 30% of the money spent on them, is immedately thrown 
    into a barrel, soaked with gasoline, and lit on fire. That's because, Bob Lutz knew how to do something like 
    that, from his very first day at GM.

    What I just said, is REALLY BAD. Spend WAY MORE, get a LOT less. 
    That's the age of internal combustion engine companies, and the WAY they took over a 100 years, to stop 
    destroying the environment and cause climate change. 

    Lazy/greedy car companies, a handful of morons on Fox News, and oil companies that assisted in the controlled
    demolition of 3 buildings in Manhattan, New York... on September 11, 2001

    Well, we're getting pretty thrown off course from Programming with PowerShell, aren't we...?
    I promise, it'll ALL coalesce back into the original lesson plan.

    The Central Intelligence Agency, as well as George W. Bush, knew Osama Bin Laden planned the airplane attacks. 
    But, Big Oil probably planned the controlled demolition, and the collapse of those towers caused people to 
    believe that the AIRPLANES caused the towers to collapse... not the explosive charges and additional 1000 degrees
    fahrenheit that would've been required to demolish the builing in the exact fashion that it was destroyed. 

    But- that's because, many morons exist.
    When using a sifter to sift through ash of roasted skeletons, what gets sifted out of the rubble, are details 
    that make the official story that NIST told, ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE. It's why WTC 7 wasn't hit by a single plane, 
    and yet, anyone who watches videos of these buildings collapsing, they will inevitably realize... 

    Robert Korol was correct that whole entire time. 
    Never was incorrect, actually. 
    Kept being correct from the very first day, and continued to be correct, as well as Leeroy Hulsey, Xili Quan, and 
    Feng Xiao.
    
    Wanna know who was NEVER correct at all...? 
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology.
    
    Especially the report that Shayam Sundar signed off on, for former president, George W. Bush.
    
    At which point, the story could go forward in time and talk about violations to the Constitution, committed 
    by President Bush, Michael Hayden, the NSA/CIA/FBI, PRISM, Technology, xKeyScore, Mystic, but ultimately, all of 
    that leads to a thing called: Cyberterrorism, a thing that police don't appear to investigate... only civilians.

    And that's how it ALLLLLLLL ties back into the original lesson plan.
    Cyberterrorism.

    If you contact the local boys, they will laugh at you cause they don't know about stuff like Pegasus. 
    Some of them are pretty gay about it too. 

    The most advanced spyware application in the world, incredibly dangerous, allows a remote party the ability to 
    log into a device with no user interaction whatsoever on Apple, and Android.

    The State boys do SOME work with actual FBI guys, but the local dispatch office where I live has someone there

    shown how be a lot more attentive to detail and observant. 

    As it is, some of them really are that stupid. (Though, I can't apply that designation unilaterally)
    Same goes for trying to call the FBI, or the NSA, or whatever. (Same as above) 

    I've come to believe that none of these organizations even do what they tell the general public they do. 
    They have their tasks and orders, and those orders are to avoid interacting with the general public at all 
    costs. Because if the truth came out, that their main duties are to surveil and control the general population, 
    and lie needlessly about everything that they possibly can, it makes more sense than trying to call them, and 
    ask them why they always seeem to be completely silent recording phone conversations. 

    Yes. They have made it very obvious to me that once you know exactly what I do...? 
    They manipulate the general population to think that I must have it all wrong... when I don't have it all wrong 
    at all. If they gave me the INCENTIVE to believe otherwise, they would've done so by now.

    There's only one party I know for a fact that I can trust.
    Until I see *any* indication otherwise? I remain firm with this assessment.

    They are absolutely terrible at it. (Though, I can't apply that designation unilaterally)
    Just as terrible at investigating technology based attacks, as Bob Lutz has always been at making good vehicles 
    at GM for 50 years. A long chapter of time where some blindfolded noob just swung wildly at whatever, and 
    called THAT.... “being a role model citizen".

    All of these things, when combined into a total narrative that sounds more intelligent than Tucker Carlson ever 
    does on any given day, are the reasons why the wildfires are really bad, AND the droughts are getting a lot worse 
    (look at Lake Mead, less than 1/3 of it's normal capacity, and dropping). 

    But also, the hurricanes are getting worse. 
    And, the deadly tornado outbreaks. 
    And, houses and coastal towns slowly receding. 
    I could probably continue with the story many different ways.

    The truth is, America has too many people that blindly believe whatever they're told.
    Hence why NEWS versus PROPAGANDA is RATHER IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND.

    If people blindly believe whatever they're told...? 
    It immediately causes them to become fools. Effortlessly.

    If some important person lies to everyone on a press conference...?
    80% of the people will believe the lie that they are told.

    Then when you TELL them the actual truth, it is extremely difficult to match the criteria where
    they'll consider entertaining a much better, more accurate story, without being offended.

    Because if you lose out on getting through to them within this window, they will go right ahead, and prove that 
    they're just too ignorant or careless to dislodge the notion, ...that they've been lied to so many times, the 
    truth is stranger than fiction.
    
    Not just (1) time either. But, repeatedly.
    That is why the car industry is still as dominant as it is, Americans don't actually care if they waste their 
    money on a vehicle that was poorly made, or if they waste `$1T on a bunch of weapons, equipment, vehicles, 
    helicopters, armaments, and other investments in Afghanistan.
    
    So, many Americans fail to grasp, that every single penny that they gave the government for X amount of time, 
    was thrown into a barrel, soaked with gasoline, and the set on fire. But, they don't get it.

    So many people died, and so many of everybody's hard earned tax dollars, they're being pissed away, by people in 
    the government that are CARELESS. When I say careless, I would go so far as to say "brain dead". 
    Or like, "someone that spent 50 years making terrible vehicles at GM."
    
    When the F-35 Lightning was boasted about being the next heavy contender for the skies...?
    I knew that Lockheed Martin already made the best fighter jet ever built by a single country, it was the best 
    thing George Bush ever committed to building, as President. Bush has so many stains on his legacy, that it is 
    LITERALLY UNSAFE to write about those stains at all. 

    Because, someone will censor anybody for discussing those very clear, and real stains. 
    But- the F-22 Raptor, wasn't a stain at all. 
    The war in Iraq...? Not a BAD idea. 
    The war in Afghanistan...? Literally the worst idea our military has ever committed to, by far.

    But, even considering all of those things...?
    Former President George W. Bush, is a saint, of all sainthood, in comparison to this moron named Bob Lutz who ran 
    GM for 50 years (though to be clear, GWB is no saint).

    Elon Musk, gave a guy Bob Lutz, the BIGGEST middle finger, in the history of middlefingerhood...

    ...a huge middle finger to them ALL for doubting him immensely, Elon Musk set out to do what no man has ever 
    tried to do before him, like the man was born to do it.

    Dude might crack some jokes that piss a lot of people off even more...?

    would legitimately be able to TURN THE WHEELS the ENTIRE TIME it was in space. Cause SOLAR ENERGY from the SUN,
    could've CHARGED THE VEHICLE... but- Elon didn't wanna take it THAT far... Nah.

    To say that I happen to be highly impressed by the principle...?
    That's an understatement. Some people are just going to be miserable no matter what, because, they're just as 
    lazy as Bob Lutz always has been. And that's fine. So it really isn't Elons fault, that the world is full of so

    All the while, every single time people did this, it eroded his sanity.

    Even poor Bob knew that ALMOST only counts in 1) horseshoes and 2) handgrenades.
    Otherwise, ALMOST is when you need a minimum of 1.0, but- you can't get past 0.9999999999999
    That is *exactly* what the term ALMOST is ALL about.

    General Motors has come very close to ALMOST making millions of GOOD vehicles.
    The problem is in the way they design the vehicles.
    There are only (2) conditions where a General Motors vehicle can be called a GOOD vehicle.
    __________________

    When a mechanic installs parts that GM never 1) made, or 2) touched even once, in that vehicle.
    NOW... the vehicle may theoretically meet GOOD vehicle minimum requirements, like MAGIC.

    That's because, technically it's not a GM vehicle if the mechanic uses QUALITY parts.
    GM doesn't make QUALITY parts. Used to at some point, but they can't remember how they pulled it off.

    So, if it has parts in it that came from the factory? It *automatically* fails the test.

    But, if it meets the requirements, and it passes the test...? 
    It can legally be considered GOOD.
    This is actually EXTREMELY RARE...
    __________________

    The vehicle was GOOD for a few seconds at the factory up until it found out who made it.
    ...which is when it suffered a traumatic event, sustaining permanent engine damage.
    This is by design. The vehicle may SOUND fine whenever it is started.

    At the moment the vehicle is completed and attributed to Bob Lutz in any small way whatsoever...?
    ...that's when the car itself says "Wow, Bob Lutz made my ass...?"
    ...the guys at the factory respond, "Yep. Sure did, pal..."
    ...and that's when the car blows a protected head gasket that Bob had the engineers design into the process, 
    as if it were a person suffering a mini-stroke from the stress involved in being given such bad information.

    Every single GM vehicle ever made, under Bob Lutz leadership...?
    ...they've each endured this traumatic process...

    What makes it all actually work, is the specialized head gasket didn't COMPLETELY blow itself, but it will 
    remember the location where it ALMOST blew that gasket, where it'll eventually blow itself later on.

    Remember how I said ALMOST only counts in horseshoes and handgrenades...?
    Well, the engine ALMOST suffered permanent damage that THEY would've had to pay to fix.

    Since it only ALMOST blew the engine, it'll DEFINITELY happen at some later point at about 100K miles.

    While Bob Lutz himself didn't make that car, the car was NOT impressed when it was told, that Bob Lutz happened 
    to be the guy in charge of General Motors when it was marked complete at the factory.
    
    That's... all it takes. 
    The vehicle tries to commit suicide, but it's just a car, so it ends there...

    Luckily for Bob Lutz, people never seem to catch on. 
    Why...? I really have no idea.
    
    To analogize, it's like someone sitting in a room, farting repeatedly, and can't stop...

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Everyone : That's just your opinion dude... 
               Get over yourself~!

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    As for Elon Musk, this (1), single, non-plural dude, I'd imagine that he didn't think the chain of nasty farts 
    in rapid succession, was anything to be all that impressed with either.

    How could he be...? Dude made the Tesla Model S Plaid, Starship, and just bought Twitter. 
    So, if he knows something is up, then he and I both know what the hell is going on. 
    
    He and I are both EQUALLY perturbed by this disgusting stench. 
    If anything ? Elon probably could tell that there's a medical emergency goin' on. 

    He and I, just... (2) like-minded individuals that both feel a threat looming from the other side of the room 
    where Bob Lutz is endlessly rippin some friggen farts. 

    When I knew something wasn't right...? All of these people were saying:

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\
     
    Everyone : You need to grow up bro~! 
               You're the only one smelling these 'farts'. 

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    But- that's how the "grouped dementia" got em all.  They don't know whats happening, but Elon Musk and I sure as
    hell do. If Elon Musk and I see the same exact problem that nobody else does...? Well, great minds think alike. 

    That problem, is Bob Lutz rippin' an endless array of the nastiest farts any man ever smelled, and this process 
    went on for about 50 years straight over at GM Headquarters. Right under people's noses, too.

    I came into the world being very well aware of my surroundings...
    Bob thought he was being super slick. 
    Wasn't that slick at all. 
    I knew that somebody, somewhere would also be able to detect the problem...

    That problem being, Bob Lutz, showing up on the news, and saying: 

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Lutz : Hey Elon Musk, how about you show us mere mortals how to run a car company.

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    ...after this man shit his pants for over 50 years straight at GM Headquarters. 
    Maybe it wasn't 50 years straight. Coud've been 30. Or 40.
    Maybe he never actually shit his pants at all...
    Maybe Bob Lutz *started* shitting his pants quite *regularly* every day AFTER he went on the news... 
    Who the hell really knows...? 

    Whatever the case may be, I cannot help but envision the fact, that this man has spent more time attempting to 
    build many electric vehicles at GM, than Elon Musk or Tesla has. But, Bob never had the incentive, nor the talent 
    to do it well. 

    Hence, total failure each time he tried.
    Rinse, recycle, repeat... Maybe Bob should take his own advice. Ya know...?

    As for Elon Musk, the man did a lot more than just show Bob Lutz how a car company could be run, at least, 
    whenever someone with talent decides to take a break from running several other companies, and then show him how 
    to do just that. 

    But, it's as if this one guy has many talents, and I hate to be the bearer of news... 
    But, unlike Bob's 50 years of consistently above-average fartknockery...? This dude: 
    _________________________________________________
    | CONCEPTUALIZED | FINANCED | TESTED | INVENTED | 
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    ... refillable rockets that can land themselves safely without exploding. 
    That's more difficult than anything Bob Lutz did for over 50 years at GM Headquarters. 

    By the way, the newest rocket this dude made, it ALSO happens to be 25ish stories high, and meets the 
    requirements of "first reuseable flying building". NASA never even did that. Did Bob Lutz do that...? No. 
    Not in the first 20 years he ran GM, nor in the entire 50. That right there, says quite a lot.

    The fact of the matter is that Bob had a lot more time and experience to set a precedent, but- sometimes people 
    think that doing the bare minimum for 50 years is 'leading by example'. Other people like me might hear or read 
    that, and just start laughing profusely. Not laughing cause the man was trying to be funny, but laughing cause 
    he was trying to be serious. 

    That'll get ya each and every time. 
    Dude actually had the nerve to say "Why don't you come down and show us mortals how to run a car company...?" 
    And it was at a point in time where Bob Lutz went from a credible person to so many many people... 
    ...to an absolute laughingstock that shit his pants for 50 years straight. And, that's actually pretty sad.
    Bob probably cannot help the fact that he does that... So... what can anybody do...?

    Bob didn't realize that those words would come back to bite him in the ass. 
    Here's how...
    
    If anyone actually sat down and carefully studied what Elon Musk has accomplished on paper alone, it's easily 20 
    times the total amount of things Bob Lutz did in the 50 years he ran a company, one that's ALMOST made a good 
    vehicle millions of times over. 

    They know how to make good vehicles... they just prefer not to do that. 
    They prefer to suck ass at making cars, and nobody knows why.

    And, that's actually ok. 
    Some people like GM and Bob Lutz, they accept their limitations, and move on with their life. 
    And, Bob Lutz isn't the only one out there in many American industries that prefer to rest on their laurels. 

    Bob Lutz is one of those people through and through, instead of finally making some decent vehicles that could 
    finally be considered GOOD ? This dude never realized that he ALMOST made a lot of really nice vehicles. 

    The problem being, that NONE of them ever made it past the 0.99999 part of the 1.0 you'd need, to have made so 
    many decent cars. Bob Lutz was the director of General Motors for like, 50 years. 

    GM's made many attempts to build an (electric/gas) vehicle worth a damn.
    They can't do it successfully without being FORCED to by TESLA. 

    Not only have they made so many more EV's than Tesla, but also, all of their gas powered cars too. 
    A LOT MORE of both. So, it stands to reason that some guy like Bob with a lot of experience wasn't worthy of 
    a response from Elon. 

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Musk : Hey, how many electric cars have you tried to build, over the last 50 years...?

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    Probably at least 40. They didn't have this conversation though. Wanna know why...? 

    Cause Elon would rather one-up Bob Lutz in the form of using a SpaceX rocket, to launch a Tesla Roadster into space, 
    with StarMan inside... and that whole process, being the biggest middle finger, to any man throughout history...
    ...aimed squarely at Bob Lutz.

    Now, I don't know if Bob Lutz watches stuff like the news or whatever... but Elon Musk sent a god damn electric 
    car into space. In his OTHER company's ROCKET, that LANDS ITSELF...
    ____________________________________________________________________________________

    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    Anybody can go to that link up above and FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES "Where is Starman...?"
    
    I'm gonna repeat what Starman, that website, Tesla, and SpaceX's combined success, means for Bob Lutz... 
    This (1) dude is running like (5)+ companies at the same time, and literally sent an electric vehicle that was 
    actually well built, into space... using a well built rocket that his OTHER company made... to give Bob Lutz the
    biggest middle finger in human history.

    Here's what Bob has to be proud of. Causing guys like me to think that sometimes, old people don't realize how 
    outmatched they are. Even if they were an industry leader for 50 years...? It actually just translates to the 
    embarassment factor being even LARGER.

    So, the idea of purchasing a vehicle from General Motors, brand new, with a bumper-to-bumper warranty, its a 
    total waste of anyone's money. Why...? Bob Lutz created a lasting company culture that sucks ass at making 
    good cars. Because, even if you were to buy a BRAND NEW car from GM, right now...? Chances are, the engine and 
    the transmission might both break down a few thousand miles after that warranty is up. 

    Even if you bring it to the people at the dealership. Tell em: “Hey. My car is making noises...”

    Well, the ASE certified technicians might be good for (1) potential day out of (5), so, the certified techs might 
    just be there for show, not to do actual work. Because the other (4) days of the week, they may prefer to lie to 
    the customers about any warranty work on these vehicles. That makes things easier and a lot cheaper for them... 
    
    They got paid to provide a warranty, but... they reserve the right to not service the vehicle if they choose. 
    Maybe the customer should be told about that and like, get their friggen money back so actual experts can service 
    the vehicle. But, then they start hemming/hawing, not realizing how moronic they sound.
    
    Then, after the engine and the transmission break down, you have to hire an actual mechanic that knows what 
    they're doing, in order to fix it. Which means, spend another $10-15 grand on a car that the dealership "fixed". 

    But- if they say they "fixed" it, and it still has the same problems from BEFORE you dropped it off...? 
    Maybe you'll start to see the "air quotes" more readily when people talk.

    Simply put, I don't believe that GM is capable of making a single vehicle that isn't a total waste of money. 
    And, I definitely blame Bob Lutz 100%. Maybe even Bill Cass. From what I've observed, General Motors lacks: 
    ______________________________________________
    | TALENT | GOOD ENGINEERS | ACTUAL MECHANICS |
    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
    They sure as hell APPEAR to have/be PORTIONS of those things, but the CONSISTENCY is SUBSTANDARD. 
    Because, if they did...? 
    Anybody could buy a brand new car from them and expect that they'll honor the warranty/repair it.

    After owning (8) vehicles that General Motors made, the verdict is in. 
    They are ALL terribly made. Even the CADILLACS BURN OIL.
    
    That is the gods honest truth, the people at GM don't know how to make GOOD vehicles. 
    It's not the fault of the engineers, they probably know what they're doing... 
    It's not the fault of the executives, they might know what they're doing too...
    It's not the fault of the technicians that build the cars, nor the dealers...

    It literally, all boils down to the craftsmanship of the PARTS they use. 
    That's (Start → Finish), they are all fucking terribly made.

    They probably have made quality parts and vehicles at SOME point in time...?
    But, anyone may as well go ahead and say that General Motors never has, and they never will. 
    They've had like a 100 year head start over Tesla. 

    But, they didn't realize the clock was ticking, and it's (too bad/so sad). 

    They know how to make SOME of them LOOK good, but a car has to do more than just LOOK good... 
    ...to be considered a good product by actual intelligent people.

    These are all of the things I think about when I hear the name "Bob Lutz".

    No problem. 
    I wouldn't feel a need to call out a large conglomerate corporation if it had people who knew how to reliably 
    build parts for their car correctly. But, they are terrible at it.
    
    I know I'm coming across very differently than I have throughout the rest of this document, but sometimes people 
    have done more than enough to deserve being openly insulted.
    
    Just like how peanut butter goes hand in hand with jelly...?
    Bob Lutz goes hand in hand with "not very innovative or creative", or "sucks at making cars".
    The legacy of this man, will be remembered for ETERNITY... with (1) word.
    “Almost.”

    Value           : Microsoft Edge
    MemberType      : NoteProperty
    IsSettable      : True
    IsGettable      : True
    TypeNameOfValue : System.String

    IsInstance      : True

    In this instance, we don't care about the Membertype, IsSettable, IsGettable, or IsInstance properties... but 
    we'll adhere to those values anyway if we use the underlying base type.
    
    So, like I covered before the huge tangent, we can use "[PSNoteProperty]::New($Name, $Value)" to create an object
    that adheres to PSObject.Properties, and this will ADD a NEW custom property named "EntryUnique" to the custom 
    classes property list, and then it'll cast an empty object array to its value.

    This will allow one of the methods we have to write, to return NON-DEFAULT properties to it.
    Doing so adheres to the standard class properties, while allowing additional NON-DEFAULT entries to coexist 
    peacefully, and be clean and accessible. 

    Who doesn't like that idea...?

    We want the class to format itself with the right spacing.
    So, to do that, we need to get the maximum TypeNameOfValue string length.
    [Again], here's some of my "Voodoo 3 5000" action BELOW, being applied to the $Types variable. (Explained again)

    It's a multifaceted ONE-LINER involving:
    - ForEach-Object haphazardly piping itself into an array
    - $_ token with the property length being greater than 0 in square brackets acts as a switch
    - $False selects slot 0 in the array returning the string "String", cause that's binary for ya.
    - $True selects slot 1 in the array returning ($_ -Replace "System\.","")

    Now, PowerShell does an amazing job of being able to understand when it's dealing with a default system types 
    like [System.Object], or [System.String]. So, the word System being thrown all over the place is unnecessary. 
    Removing it makes the code shorter and less complicated/messy looking.

    We should probably use an exterior container class to collect all of these items and format them accordingly. 
    This will include all variables we assigned BEFORE the class definition, and then there will be NO chance, that 
    an object will be formatted with an inconsistent buffer value.

    You won't want to format the output as a table, but even if you do, everything in the NON-DEFAULT properties will 
    be caught within an array. There's really no way to get inconsistent properties to work across a bunch of entries 
    in a table that have varying property types, unless maybe you have a monitor that spans about a football field, 
    then I guess maybe that might actually work at fitting all of the possible properties that any class might have, 
    into an incredibly convenient view. 

    But, I gotta say... I don't think those types of monitors actually exist yet. 
    Then again, maybe somebody who's been working on just that exact thing I said doesn't exist...?
    Well... they just heard me loudly and clearly, and so they felt like letting me know...

           Those things DO exist.
    Me   : Oh yeh...?
    FFMD : Yeh. 
           And you call yourself some type of expert or something...? 
           *scoffs, eyebrows up* Unbelievable...
    Me   : I didn't know they did.
    FFMD : Yeah pal. 
           They most certainly do. 
           Everybody knows that...
    Me   : I didn't know that they actually made a monitor that spans a whole entire football field...
    FFMD : Yeah well... 
           ...now you know. 
           What, have you been livin' under a rock or somethin...?
    Me   : Nah.
    FFMD : Well buddy... nice tutorial... 
           But I'm offended about the monitor thing.
    Me   : Alright...? 
           I'm sorry...?
    FFMD : Wait... 
           ...you're... 
           ...sorry...?
    Me   : Yeah man, didn't realize I offended you by not knowing a monitor that long actually exists...
    FFMD : Yeah, they do. 
           You should totally get one, very convenient, you can see the entire screen no problem...
    Me   : Alright buddy. 
           Duly noted. 
           Well, I still have one more phase of this tutorial left to go.
    FFMD : Oh yeah...?
    Me   : Yep. 
           Gonna throw all of that stuff into a class that generates... classes.
    FFMD : A class that generates classes...? 
           What are ya, some type of magician or somethin'?
    Me   : No...
    FFMD : Buddy, you've got a lot of tricks.
    Me   : Well, cool. 
           I appreciate that.
    FFMD : I guess I'll stick around and keep reading.
    Me   : Alright fine. 
           Take care, buddy.
    FFMD : You too. Get one of those monitors...

    Those types of monitors don't exist. 
    I was being facetious about the convenient viewing angle.
    
    Even if they did make them, what practical purpose would anyone use them for...? 
    There's only (1) thing I can think of... to join a bunch of classes that have no matching properties at all.

    It's not unlike buying an Nvidia GTX 3090, so you could play Pogo.com and then brag about it.

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Person : Check it out... 
             *points* I've got an Nvidia GTX 3090. 
             NOW, I am basically unbeatable at Pop-It.
    Me     : Wow.
             Impressive.
    Person : *chuckles* Heh.
             If you don' have a GTX 3090 to play Pop-It...? 
             Who the hell even are ya...?

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    (^ Pretty sure that's overkill, and that graphics card doesn't do anything for that game/purpose)
    
    Or, taking your paycheck, and then just throwing it in the trash because... why not...?

    These things probably sound like they make no sense at all, and that's the point.
    That's how much sense it makes to try and use classes that have no matching properties at all.
    You won't really have a hard time NOT noticing when they don't match up, either.
    You'll see empty cells, and values that extend about 50 miles into the horizon.

    Having SOME varying property types from class to class is ok, but try to MINIMIZE that.
    Allowing just any old class to settle down in the table...? 
    You're just asking to be confused.

    You might find yourself staring at the monitor trying to make sense of what you're seeing...
    But, the truth is, there's no sense or pattern involved after some point. 

    So, maybe you'll get confused that none of the classes match up in the table anymore... 
    Then what...? 
    Start over...?
    
    Well, I'll tell ya. 
    If the properties don't match up, then there's not a whole lot you can do.

    It's gonna be a while before anyone is able to readily make use of such an incredibly useful arrangement of class 
    types that USED to have matching properties... until one day they didn't.
    
    That's just the way the story goes, of every old man that ever lived, who, at the top of their game...? 
    He made certain that HIS classes always had matching properties. 
    ...until he slipped up.
    
    Of course, I'm shooting for dramatic story telling. 
    But, one way that we could turn the entire script into a useful tool that would help anybody custom build their 
    own classes in a jiffy, is the script. Couldn't be more serious about that actually.

    Sometimes I build custom (classes/structs) in either PowerShell or C#, and then I am able to cast some of those
    classes/structs to PowerShell/.Net type objects, and they work in literally the same way. 

    The only difference is that the PowerShell code doesn't need to be compiled by MSBuild or anything like that. 
    That's because PowerShell can compile CSharp code on the fly. It's not all-encompassing like MSBuild is, 
    sometimes CSharp code that works in an MSBuild process doesn't work with the Add-Type cmdlet... 

    I think it's just an issue with Roslyn or something. However, writing a bunch of classes/structs in CSharp 
    and then initializing and instantiating them into PowerShell is incredibly useful. 
    It's the only way to get structs into PowerShell, I think.

    What I'm going to do NOW, is, build a class that puts all of this stuff together.
    I'll start by stripping away the comments that I made on some of the above content, and then
    edit it until it's literally picture perfect, and reproduces the same output as above.

    Now, I'll develop these above variables as (2) separate classes, one for the container, one for the class object, 
    and the class object needs to be written FIRST so that the type can be used in the container class. 

    Even though the variables are right ABOVE, they will LIKELY have to be rearranged in order to work as a pair 
    of classes, though not necessarily.

    And though, reading the material will feel like the above paragraph was SOOOO 30 seconds ago...?
    The truth is that when this was written, I spent about a half hour working on it and tweaking it.

    The NAME of this class, is essentially "DefinitionTemplate", because the name of this class doesn't NEED to be 
    COOL, because it's job is to produce a class that includes various elements that would be needed to perform the 
    same exact activity as the variables listed directly above.

    However, this class has implemented many changes to the code it's based on up above, while still producing the 
    same output. Some of those changes are details that wouldn't even be seen when using it. But, if you were to 
    debug what it does, you'd see how it molds and shapes the output, and you'd easily see how OTHER techniques 
    were applied, to produce the same result.

    Sometimes this process can make the code longer, but other times it can make the code much more responsive or even 
    give it more features so other elements can be added/amended whereby boosting flexibility, capability, or scope.

    The fully written class is below, as is. 
    AFTER this stint, I will break it down and explain the differences between the variables above, and the 
    properties and variables in the class.
    ____________________________________________________________________________________________
    | Note : This class is just a current derivative, if I were to keep working on it, I would |
    | implement various changes to more finely tune the capabilities, properties, values, etc. |

    At least the content of the method named Output does.

    That's because I added a feature that would automatically indent lines within any given method fed to the 
    AddMethod([Object[]]$Object) method. But, then I realized that probably isn't a great use of my time to go the 
    full mile there.

    There are many things in the .NET framework that can actually indent some of this stuff FOR you, or anybody else 
    really... but sometimes, learning how to do it without a tool like that can help bolster one's ability to do it 
    themselves. When they do, they'll understand how the "pros" went ahead, and wrote a class that does all of that 
    work, cause they're probably a real nice (guy/girl).

    Whether you use one of the StringWriter class types, or I think the Xmlwriter class also does it, can't think off 
    the top of my head what other default classes automatically indent stuff for you, but they're out there. 

    Things become harder to do when you're writing CODE that does what you as a human would do when editing the 
    content, and that's when design choices might change.

    The BEFORE stuff is actually all the variables starting from where the pros suggested that using Get-WMIObject
    Win32_Product to get installed applications, is not the best way to get that info.
    
    Looking through the registry is actually a WAY snappier way to do the job, and any pro would tell you that. 
    The thing is, the registry and the WMI objects don't have the same values. 

    So, since Matthew Caldwell had us imaging THOUSANDS of machines incorrectly...? 
    Whereby forcing is to redo a LOT of work that we had to do OVER again...? 

    WELL... we had to make some serious changes after writing the WMIClass at the top. 
    Not to mention, the WMIClass reaches into the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT for GUID's and stuff that isn't automatically 
    available to PowerShell without opening a new PSDrive to HKCR:\*. Pretty sure anyway.

    The AFTER stuff is essentially the same code, largely. 
    Except, there are (2) properties that replace a couple of the variables, like $This.Output and $This.Buffer. 
    The other variables are still written the same way.

    You can get away with this for a large majority of the conversion, UNLESS, having a PROPERTY makes more sense.
    Properties of the class will RETAIN the information, whereas variables will NOT, unless they're cast to a property.

    The Before stuff right here is doing a lot of the work in processing the values in the $Properties variable. 
    The $Properties variable is an object array of PSNoteProperties based off of the $PSObject.Properties variable. 

    The hash table is there reserving some collection containers for properties Type, Const, and Method.

    Then the loop just goes right ahead and starts processing every item in the $Names array.
    It is also calculating the length of the buffer strings so that it formats the code neatly.

    The After stuff right here looks a lot like the individuals up above.
    However, there are many things that have been moved around to make the process more structurally sound. 
    Mainly because the hash table that was named $Def, was a good idea to turn into the default constructor and 
    class properties. 

    The intitial constructor requests (3) parameters: 
    1) name of the class 
    2) Parameter1Type 
    3) Parameter1Value
    ...which can be seen up in the before section, except now the class can accommodate a much more broad range of 
    input without doing a heck of a lot different. 

    The same can also be done with the hash table. But- if I want to make multiple copies of the class, each with a 
    different set of values, that's a lot easier. With the hashtable, I'd have to copy and paste the hashtable, and 
    then manually enter new values for those new hashtables, otherwise they'll have the same information.

    Which is... rather anticlimactic, in all honesty. 
    Nothing like seeing thousands of the same exact hash table cause a token variable somewhere wasn't being changed.
    The hashtables also don't scale well as a table like the classes do. 

    They CAN, but the class doesn't lose any of it's key arrangements or positioning, so the class is more consistent 
    and reliable. That's not ALWAYS the case, but in this case, it most certainly is.

    The method LoadPropertySet($Properties) does the same job as the individual variables in the before stuff above.
    However, there are some KEY DIFFERENCES to note here. For starters, the way in which the variables were moved 
    around, allowed the hashtable stuff to be put in it's own constructor.

    Then, shifting the remaining variables from that particular block around, allowed moving the type length 
    determination process, the type buffer, type buffer to string, as well as the name length determination process, 
    name buffer, and name buffer to string... not only to the same block, but- there was a perfect opportunity to 
    create a couple of new methods that cleaned up the way that code looked, while also providing some more control. 
   
    Maybe it's a matter of preference...? Idk.
    But I like the way that portion of the code looks a LOT better than the individual variables.

    Suffice to say, adding those methods makes a lot of sense as they're adding properties, and then setting the 
    property values... having a method with a name gives anybody a better sense of what is actually happening behind 
    the code.

    The Before stuff here, generally looks a lot like the after stuff, but, the class has methods where these values 
    are just being changed directly. Like, the first couple of variables are pulling an index number to specifically 
    recall the index of the property that's about to be changed, and then it changes it with some regex. 

    The after stuff is doing that too... albeit with changes.

    The variables named $Method1, $Method2, and $Method3 really aren't all that different from the after stuff 
    either, except here, there's no actual method that's inserting those variable values into the hashtable property 
    named “Method”. 

    Which is fine...? 
    But, having a method name that describes the function is really what makes a class even more useful than a slew 
    of variables all taped together. There really is no way to get away from that feeling where using many variables
    that aren't connected to a larger container object, starts to feel as if they're all operating on their own accord.                                                                             
    Obviously, this process is required to build the class types, it's just that if a script writer doesn't make the 
    effort to implement class types and stuff, they may never be able to write code that is able to describe itself 
    a lot more clearly and coherently, and methods and even loop labels go a long way to assist with breaking portions 
    of code off into trunks or branches, rather than one giant soup bowl of variables. 

    Just, variable soup. I don't see people using many loop labels these days, because it's essentially the same thing
    as a method, or a switch block.

    The after stuff here is a lot longer, no question about it.
    Nothing seen in this group of methods is actually reproducing the code above, however-
    
    It's doing additional things that make the code easier to throw OTHER values at, making it even more flexible 
    than it already was. I'm going to paste the portion of code where the class is instantiated and then the methods 
    that produce the same content as the variables up above, will be more readily comparable.

    The first two lines here instantiate the class.
    Then the method LoadPropertySet injects the PSObject.Properties information. 
    The third method ChangeProperty is performing the same activity as the first two variables in the before 
    section directly above. 

    Now I can explain why the code in the class is longer, but- achieves a better end result...                                     
    The method ChangeProperty looks for the property in the constructor "EntryUnique", and then sets its value to 
    what is written in the quotes as the second parameter. 

    It's doing almost the identical thing under the hood as above, however the method ChangeProperty is providing 
    a little bit of error handling, so if the property parameter finds no result, then it doesn't just NOT tell 
    you that nothing was done, it'll say that. 

    But also, it uses a double not true boolean statement where if the token $X is returned via the double 
    negative check, then that means it found the thing and it made the change. 

    Otherwise it didn't, and will say "failed..."
    As for the method AddMethod(), it is generally identical to the previous variable method, but- I was able to 
    implement spacing changes so that the input strings don't need to include those spaces. 

    Even if they do, they're gonna get ripped out and then reinserted from the ground up. Why? 
    Because it made more sense to do it that way. 

    However, it did mess with the way I like my code to be indented from nested code block to nested code block 
    within a method. But, that's really a matter of preference and it's not a structural defect or anything. 

    Also, the methods could also be added in the same way as the naked variables, where there was $Method1, 
    $Method2, and $Method3 and then those values were added... It could be done that way here as well.

    The main difference is that the method is NAMED, rather than just having some property named “Method” that 
    allows items to be added to it. Yeah, naming a property "method" that isn't actually a method might cause some 
    confusion somewhere...? But then again, maybe it won't... 

    Either way, it's better to have a legitimate, actual, factual method named "AddMethod" rather than wingin' it 
    with a property named Method then a plus sign and an equals sign, then a variable value.

    I know somebody somewhere is going to say "That's not an actual method..."
    I'm aware of that... it's a property named method, that just so happens to be inserting a value that represents 
    the string version of a method for a class. A wolf in sheeps clothing, essentially.

    It's not unlike showing up to a party in a shirt that says "I'm wearing a black shirt", but...
    ...your shirt is actually white. 

    Everyone's that takes their time to read your shirt is going to think... 

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Person 1 : That dude's wearing a white shirt that says 'I'm wearing a black shirt'...
    Person 2 : Wow. 
               That dude's shirt definitely says that, and it IS white...
    Person 3+: Dude's wearin' a white shirt, but then the shirt says "I'm wearing a black shirt"...
    (Then somebody will eventually say...)
    Person 9 : So, is it like the SHIRT that's wearing a shirt...? 
               Or like-
               *shakes head* I don't even know dude... 
               ...that shirt is blowing my mind right now...

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    Maybe it won't be that dramatic though.

    There's not much left to go over. 
    It's literally just the class definition variable, the thing that's supposed to capture the output of the 
    variables up above, so that the class can be loaded into memory, and then it can be instantiated.
    
    There's no question, that having blobs of code written all over the place like what's directly above this 
    paragraph, are a headache to look at. It's long, it's mean looking, doesn't even remotely feel like a cool dude 
    that just so happens to be hanging out at the park during the summer... 

    The reason for that is because whenyoutrytostuffabunchofthingsintosomethinglikethat-
    itkindalookslikeascarymessthatnobodywantstobenearoraroundcauseitslongcomplicatedlookingandnotfun.
    
    I realize, it probably doesn't look THAT BAD... but that whole "throwing away the spacebar" comment is sorta 
    the vibe that it gives me. All it's doing is generating the single output string that just so happens to be 
    the output of the entire set of variables. 

    But, there's so many ways it can be optimized:

    1) String interpolation
    2) directly embedding the values without so many quotes,
    3) joining the strings together in separate chunks

    It's not BAD for a FIRST ATTEMPT when you're conceptualizing something... 
    ...but at some point, this will cause anybody that respects well written code, to say (1) word. "Ahhh!"

    Do you want somebody who's always been known for respecting well written code, to say "Ahhh!"...
    ...when they look at YOURS...? 
    Probably not, right...? 
    Cause "Ahhh!" isn't even a word, really.

    At which point, who's the person who feels most insulted...? You...?
    Or some guy that has always been known for respecting well written code... that said "Ahhh!"...
    ...when they looked at yours...?

    Maybe Linus Torvalds may have to come out from somewhere, and say:

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Torvalds : I've seen FAR worse code than that, pal. 
               And, I've ALWAYS been known for respecting well-written code...
    (Then I guess I'm gonna have to put my hands up...)
    Me       : Alright...~! 
               Can't argue with ya."

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    Cause who's gonna argue with Linus Torvalds... the man who wrote Linux? Nobody, that's who.
    Everyone reading this will probably agree with me: 

    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Everybody : *shakes head* Yeah. 
                That Linus Torvalds guy...? 
                He literally knows the ins and outs of well written code... 

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    In that case...? Then MAYBE it's settled... 
    MAYBE the code above isn't THAT bad. 

    But, PERSONALLY...? I feel as if it appears that the author lost track of their space bar, or enter key. 
    Maybe that's fine sometimes. What do I know?
    
    Whether I AM THE GUY THAT WROTE THAT or not...? 
    It's irrelevant. 

    Gives me the heebie jeebies.
    And, that's why I rewrote it in the class and that whole mess became this thing below...

    People may look at this and think... 
    But- you had all of that in one line... This is like (12+).
    
    Yep. 
    I know, it APPEARS to be a lot MORE INFORMATION (in this case it is), but sometimes I ask myself how the highway 
    guys can stand working on the highway all day in the heat, those tenth of a mile markers being the thing they gotta
    drop a bunch of asphalt between, and they'll occasionally look at these markers to gauge their progress. 

    They probably live for each and every one of those things too.
    
    /¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\

    Highway guy: Ah man. 
                 Just another... 
                 4 miles to go. 
                 Not bad. 
                 It's only Monday though. 
                 Damnit.

    \__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/¯¯\__/

    You know that they're walking... and they look at these things like a clock or a watch.
    Pouring, and laying down some asphalt all day long... living through hell, paycheck to paycheck.

    Here's why I prefer the thing above. 
    If I want to make it shorter, that's easy. 
    Highway guy can't make his job any shorter if he even wanted to. 
    With 4 miles of asphalt to lay, there's nothing he can do to make his job less difficult on himself. 

    But, I definitely CAN make MY job easier on myself. 
    So, if I want to examine a problem with the output, then I've made it incredibly easy to track down what COULD be
    causing an issue, adjust it, and then I totally avoid feeling like that dude on the highway in the blistering heat,
    just pouring asphalt all day long...
    
    Cause, even though those guys typically get paid pretty well...? 
    I don't think a single one of them dudes really LOVE doing that job... 
    Maybe some of them do, I don't know. 

   From what some of my friends tell me they say it's ONLY fun AFTER you get paid.
