.SYNOPSIS
        No one goes around and says "I really LOVE cybercriminals AND what they do."
        Wanna know why...?
        Uh, it's cause cybercriminals suck ass. That's the end of the conversation. 
        Show people who the hell is really gonna roll up their sleeves, and do (2) things:
        (1) ATTACK the CYBERCRIMINALS by using MANIPULATIVE OFFENSIVE STRATEGIES such as:
            - calling them a bunch of douchebags repeatedly
            - refining the insults even more, and then directing them at these pansies
            - showing them what a waste of life they truly are, just like Vladimir Putin
            - educating people on how lame (cybercriminals/Vladimir Putin) really (are/is)
        (2) BUILDING a SERIES of EXTREMELY SOPHISTICATED DEFENSIVE TECHNIQUES such as:
            - educating people on how lame cybercriminals really are
            - manipulating these morons into waging their ATTACKS against PRIMED HONEYPOTS
            - using VIRTUALIZATION to create PRIMED HONEYPOTS and developing PATTERN ANALYSIS
            - studying the PATTERN ANALYSIS to EXFILTRATE the ATTACK VECTORS they use 
            - continue making fun of them, and explaining HOW/WHY they're a waste of life 
        ...and call these things [FightingEntropy(π)]
.DESCRIPTION
        Meant to impress the daylights out of the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency,
        the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of
        Homeland Security, the Central Intelligence Agency, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and etc.
        Maybe even William Gates, Stephen Ballmer, Satya Nadella...
