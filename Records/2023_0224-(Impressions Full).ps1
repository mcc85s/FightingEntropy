:Saturday, February 18th, 2023, Michael Cook speaking. It's currently, 5:56pm...?

I'm making this audio log to talk about terms that are rather offensive, which I sort of capitalized
on earlier today, uhm- however, I'd like to expand upon that because...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:20","00:41",@'
:I know that uh- some of my language is uh- it OFFENDS certain people, right...?
Or maybe my language will offend EVERYBODY, right...?
And then, I have to rewind to like an audio recording that I made uh- a few months ago,
sorta like uh, observing and analyzing some uh- of uh George Carlin's
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:41","00:57",@'
:Uh- rhetoric, right...?
Regard-, uh- especially regarding the, his skit from like the- sometime in the 70's,
regarding the 7 words that you'll never hear on the fuckin' TV.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:57","01:12",@'
:Right so, already right there, I'm already whippin' out the F word.
So I'm sorta like, bein' a trollmeister 5000 already. 
But I'm not being a REAL trollmeister... not at all.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:12","01:32",@'
:Nah, I think the problem is that, I'm being limited by people that are fuckin' 
stupid, and they ha- the reason why they're doing it is because they're jealous
of how fuckin' intelligent I am, and they will use every fucking trick or, uh- 
trick in the book, to try to limit me...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:32","01:50",@'
:And then make, uh- OTHER people's perceptions of what I say or do...
to seem so OFFENSIVE, that like, I should practically be in a prison or a jail 
cell, for the amount of foul ass fuckin' things that I say.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:50","02:08",@'
:Right...? So what I'm doing, is I'm exhibiting a sense of being more sophisticated
than a lot of people, who like follow the rules, and got to where they we- where 
they are in society, by doing what they were told, and being a good little boy or
girl, that ya know, followed instructions...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"02:08","02:31",@'
:Right...? I can convey a sense of being just as sophisticated as uh- Rex Smith 
over at the Times Union, or any of the uh the journalists that work at the Times 
Union, or the Gazette, or the Saratogian, or like the New York Post, or WTEN or
WRGB, or WNYT, right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"02:31","03:01",@'
:I exhibit a sense of uh- being extremely sophisticated when I talk, right...?
And then when like, I capitalize on something offensive and it goes against the
conventional mold of society, I think what happens is that somebody, that's been
trying to contain me, wants to make it so that- I- I give up on myself, or uh- 
other people, THEY give up on like, uh, reading or absorbing my content or 
whatever I have to say or produce.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"03:01","03:20",@'
:Right...? And this typically happens when I insult certain highly respected
people, right...? And then like, I'll notice like, uhm, some of these signs
that I have hit the nail right on the fuckin' head... when, some of the 
numbers that I'm seeing...? They're being skewed, right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"03:20","03:39",@'
:So like if I- lets- let me put it into perspective. 
So if I send a text message to this- some girl, that like, always wants to
have sex- have sex with me, right...? Right...?

And uh- had sex with her for many many weeks, every single time we started
messaging, she's like 'Hey, wanna have sex...?' ...right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"03:39","03:59",@'
:So like if I establish that as a baseline, and I know that if I text some
girl about havin' sex with her...? She's gonna text me back in a few minutes
to like an hour, she might be bus- like, lets say on the worst occasion, 
she might be so busy that she doesn't get back to me within like an hour
or two... right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"03:59","04:35",@'
:So, if I establish that as a baseline...?
And then like, something fuckin' happens, or like, I say something that
really upsets her, or whatever...? And then I like, try to use the same
tactics...? Even more...? And like, she starts to come up with excuses 
like "Oh, I uh- fell asleep..." or "Oh, um... I was- I was going like, 
grocery shopping with my mom, and I left my phone at my other house...
I just got back, is- I know it's been like 3 days, but you know, um..."
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"04:35","04:51",@'
:SO, what I'm doing right there, is I'm illuminating there's a reason WHY someone would be-
would say misleading things to me. Or, wouldn't be reporting the same sort of uh- events.

Or, I might like- ok.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"04:51","05:09",@'
:So, allow me to apply this to a, everyone else. Right...? 
Everybody else...? They think like on a, what-happens-today...and-that's-it basis...

They dont' really think about like, things in their future, unless they're planning for
something like they're goin' to school or whatever...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"05:09","05:20",@'
:They don't really think a lot about their past, unless they're thinking about like,
what they want to achieve in life, or what they decided to be when they started going
to school, or, or whatever...? Right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"05:20","05:43",@'
:So our society unwittingly trains people to throw out the idea of uh- remembering
things, and uh- being sophisticated, and uh- society uses a range of tactics to try
to like exude dominance or control or whatever, right...? So like um...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"05:43","06:14",@'
:I've been uh- consistently uploading videos over the last, you know, couple of weeks,
every day, maybe (1) video or multiple...? Not all of the videos have gotten attention, 
or like uh- whatever...? But um, I've seen a consistent effort from like somebody working
at either Google, or somewhere in between, me and Google, like, seeing the content that
I'm like, uploading...? And then responding to it, and like saying:
"Yeh, that's cool. Your content's cool or whatever..."
Right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"06:14","07:02",@'
:So what this causes me, to believe, is that it's ALWAYS a factor.

And uh- if you start out doing something that upsets people at Google, then basically
it's like uh- it's basically like uh- putting yourself in a box, and you're a plant, 
and uh- ya know the maximum shape that you weill ever grow as that plant, is the 
size of that box. You'll never be able to outgrow the box.

You'll always be confined within the box, because, you know, somebody made damn
certain that like your maximum shape would be the size of that box, and therefore, 
that allows you to only, like uh- to influence a certain number of people.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"07:02","07:15",@'
:And so like, if you try to tell people 
"Yeah, I could be WAY cooler than this fuckin' box that I'm in... and I'll talk
about how fuckin' cool I am...?" And then like uh- you try to like impress other
people, or like, go outside of the box...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"07:15","07:36",@'
:What happens is like people will be like
"Well, why the fuck isn't this dude on like uh- like uhm, like HBO doing stand up
specials or some shit...?" Cause what he's sayin' is genuinely funny, but like
what'll happen is like some people will be like 
"Well if he was that funny, then why aren't people reacting to some of the shit
that he's saying..?" Right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"07:36","07:56",@'
:And then what I'll say is that I've been being censored on Facebook by the owner
of Facebook, like at an aggressive rate, and it's so aggressive that like when I 
mention him in some of the videos that I make..? Uh, what happens is like, there'll
be like zero views, or somethin' like that.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"07:56","08:12",@'
:It'd basically be like "What the fuck...? A ghost town..."
And like, ya know, this uh- its so fuckin' uhhhh, obvious that like, something
I'm doing is pissin' off somebody with a lot of money, and it could be multiple
people that I'm pissin' off, th- they all have a lot of money.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"08:12","08:51",@'
:And they don't like when I talk about them, because I think that some of them are
fuckin' jealous as to how intelligent I am, and they didn't get to be where they
are by like, allowing people like me, to have free reign, like, normal every-day
citizens do, and what this causes is like uh- me to think of ways to like uh- 
derive who would have those intentions, and then like, uh- what you come to find
is like, uh- there might be an evil trollmeister that is tryin' to like, uh- 
keep me as quiet as possible...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"08:51","09:07",@'
:So that I cannot influence additional people, nor get myself out of the position
that I'm in, because, the public opinion of me, has been consider- considerably
reduced because of a number of fucking morons marring my character, and therefore...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"09:07","09:38",@'
:What this ALSO causes, is like sometimes I will say something that's genuinely funny,
and I'll reference something that's genuinely funny, and I'll post it on Facebook
or like social media, and then someone will come along, and then remotely connect
to my device, it'll cause the icons on my desktop to flash, so then I have to start
talking about how I went to a bunch of places, yesterday, and then distributed a
document, in the document I talk about like uh-
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"09:38","09:55",@'
:All of the work that I've been doing the last couple of months, I can guarantee
that most people aren't gonna like, consume all of that content, but what I CAN say,
is that I know for a god damn fact, that when I stopped at the Saratoga County
Sheriffs Office Administrative Office...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"09:55","10:03",@'
:And then I said "Hey I'd like to speak to Michael Zurlo, the county Sheriff..."
Then what happened was...

statement to [Sara DeRusso], of the [State Police], right...?

And uhm, unbeknownst to THEM, [they never corroborated MY side of the story]. 
And as soon as I told them that I had an [AUDIO RECORDING that I UPLOADED, PRIOR to HER
making the 911 call]... 

Uh, it- I went through and I transcribed the audio recording, I tried to give it to my
public defender (former JC Davis, current Michael Depresso), and like... the COURT is
doing a really fine, swell job of kinda like, pretending that doesn't exist. 

And that like, I'm... guilty.

So, on THAT one right there, THAT has the links to it. I have uh- there's (3)
different versions of the sound file, the original one, it was very hard to
hear, and its a (16h) recording.

I edited it because, basically when I say that I'm an orator, I walk around and 
I recorded myself uh-
'@)

$Ctrl.X(1,"08:34","08:36",@'
:How do I spell that, 'orator'...? How do I spell that...?

$Ctrl.X(0,"08:36","08:47",@'

'@)

$Ctrl.X(1,"08:47","08:48",@'
:I see that.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"08:48","08:55",@'

Or maybe not necessarily a professor, but somebody that speaks out loud, or like
practices public speaking.

$Ctrl.X(1,"08:55","08:55",@'
:Ok.

$Ctrl.X(0,"08:55","08:59",@'

'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"09:01","09:21",@'
:So, I practice this, I listen to myself speak, I listen to my recordings.

I try to talk about things that are bothering me, things in the past. 
I make I make a very uh, big effort to like, be considerate to not cross the red lines, 
or red flag area, but- yeh. [Basically, I talk about everything that I think of].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(1,"09:21","09:22",@'

'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"09:34","10:05",@'
:Uhm, it'd be NICE, heh. To be perfectly clear, I think that he has been payin' 
attention to me on either [Facebook], or [through the community], and he had his son
[Paul Zurlo] come to my house multiple times 
(one of those times was with the guy who tased me on 06/28/22)... 
and rather than for me to make that [speculation] or [assumption], I wrote a bunch
of documents...? I haven't had a conversation with him yet.

If I have a conversation with him and I like what I hear, and I believe him...
Then those documents, they're gonna need- they're gonna be rewritten.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(1,"10:05","10:08",@'
:Ok, *turns page* fair enough.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"10:08","10:10",@'

'@)

$Ctrl.X(1,"10:10","10:10",@'

'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"10:10","10:19",@'

speaking with uh (you), (not) captain [Tim Brown].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(1,"10:19","10:20",@'
:Ok.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"10:20","10:26",@'

that date is [May 23rd] when [Scott Schelling] originally responded to the incident
at [Stratton].

It's NOT related to the (3) sheriffs that were involved at, the [Zappone] dealership,
or at least in front of it. 
On [Route 9]. 
On [May 26th], at approximately [1AM]. 

There should be a [record] of that and I should, I should be able to contact the records
department, and be able to find that interaction that may not have my name on it. There
is a record of that interaction because [Sergeant Welch] told me that it exists. So...

[wide-ranging conspiracy] involving [my department].

<#
    ===========================
    | Wide-Ranging Conspiracy |
    ===========================

    Yeah, because I was [arrested] over a [post-dated ticket] after my [iPhone 8+] was [disabled].
    It was [disabled by the manufacturer, Apple Corporation] after I [showed a video] to [NYSP Shaemus Leavey] 
    at [05/27/20 0900].

    That video being the one I recorded outside of the [Catricala Funeral Home] from [05/25/20 2343] to [05/26/20 0004]
    of [(2) dudes using a DANGEROUS ESPIONAGE TOOL DESIGNED TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET SMARTPHONES CALLED "PHANTOM"].

    In that video, these [(2) dudes/queers] appeared to be right smack dab in the middle of [attempting to murder me].

    Maybe there is no [wide-ranging conspiracy] at all, and it just LOOKS like [Eric Catricala had (2) different events
    merged together into a single incident (3) days late, and had (0) evidence of me really doing a god damn thing].

    Oh wait, [I have evidence that could corroborate HIS side of the story]...
    It's just that [the evidence I have would contradict the reported time], as well as [insert the record]: 
    [SCSO-2020-028501].
    
    [Nothing suspicious about any of this shit in the least (sarcasm).] 

    Meanwhile, [I have like dozens of fucking pictures, as well as a few AUDIO RECORDINGS], and... 
    [SOMEHOW I get arrested for cutting a fucking $5.00 kayak strap at 1769 Route 9, on a post-dated ticket]. 
    
    The [PHONE LINE] that [I SEVERED] because I was attempting to call 911 SOMEHOW, [NOT] being the reason for 
    arresting me.

    Why did I cut the phone line, is [not a question any investigator nor police officer has asked me].
    I would've thought at the very least, some dude from SCSO would've approached me and been like...

    [===========================================================================================================]

    [Guy] : What the actual fuck, dude...?
    [Me]  : What...?
    [Guy] : So you fuckin' cut some dude's phone line, didn't ya...?
    [Me]  : Well, yeh.
    [Guy] : Yeah well, why the hell would you do something crazy like that...?
            You done messed up [A-A-Ron]...
    [Me]  : It's cause I was trying to call (911).
    [Guy] : *rolls his eyes* Buddy, everybody tries to call (911).
            *shakes head* I don't even wanna hear it, I gotta arrest you for that...

    [^ what never happened.]  

    [===========================================================================================================]

    But I'll tell ya, cause I had attempted to call (911) (2) times during this (90) minute event where (2) dudes 
    were chasing me, and trying to kill me with a car parked ahead of the (3) of us in the [Lowes] parking lot. 
    [Nothing shady or suspicious going on or whatever. Not at all.]

    Oh, by the way, [the (2) dudes who tried to hit me with their fucking car, nobody is going after them].

    As far as I know [your deputy] [Scott Schelling] went to [Center for Security] immediately after being at the 
    [SECONDARY LOCATION] in the TICKET that you gave me in this phone call, and I believe that either HE or someone
    else [destroyed the evidence of me calling (911) in front of the security camera at 05/26/20 0010].

    Nothing suspicious about all this shit at all. 
    Nah. 
    Everybody follows the law at all times. (sarcasm)

    Oh and by the way, the argument that I had with my mother on [06/28/22] is about the [wide-ranging conspiracy]
    I just rattled off.
    Oh by the way, [Paul Pelagalli] took custody of my fuckin' children away over this whole ordeal too.
    Oh by the way, people think I went insane, cause some people are just plain old fuckin' stupid and lazy.

    disrupt [any 911 call] from [making it to your dispatch station], and therefore, they have [strict control] over 
    the [law enforcement system].

:Well, what I'm trying to say here, is that I'm giving you my recollection of that night.

The- the attack BEGAN, on [May 25th], and went INTO [May 26th], because it occurred at
approximately [11:30], I uploaded some files from the [Clifton Park Computer Answers]
network, because I used to manage it.

After I uploaded those files, a [couple of (gay looking) kids wearing glasses], [both
wearing hats], uhm, [approximately 6 feet tall], they were [walking on opposite sides
of the street] by the way, but it was rather late so it seemed strange that anybody was
out walking at all. (They both appeared to be sausage wreckers, not unlike Andy Cuomo)

Now, I had a short conversation with one of these kids, uh- and I said
'Hey, are you from around here...?' and he said,
'No, I AM from around here, but I moved away, and then I moved back.'

I was like 'Oh, ok.' and he walks on, and as he's walking on I type something into
my cell phone screen, and whatever I typed into my cell phone screen caused this kid
to STOP, dead in his tracks, when he looked at HIS cell phone, several feet away
(in front of the Catricala Funeral Home).

Maybe (50) feet away, maybe (100) feet.

Now, it could be coincidental (nah it wasn't, he tried to hit me when I was recording
the last audio recording I uploaded prior to the foot chase attack) that he just
happened to look at his phone at a certain time, and he just stopped dead in his
tracks, and it looked like he saw bad news. That's what MY impression was.

At any rate, a couple other things happened, uh- there was a kid at the laundromat
that night, pretty sure that place had surveillance footage but uh- there was a kid
in a black dodge, at that gas station, that was leaving.

<#
    =======================
    | Obstructing Justice |
    =======================

    What about [multiple fellow officers] [obstructing justice]...?
    Or the [telephony DDOS attacks]...?
    [Pretty sure those are crimes, too].

    MAYBE, as long as THOSE [crimes] are [committed when nobody is looking]...?
    Then they're not [reportable] nor [arrestable crimes].

    [So, someone can →]

    [+] [destroy evidence] of [911 calls/attempted murder/vehicular manslaughter]
    [~] ...as long as...
    [+] [any evidence of those crimes being committed] is [destroyed] AFTER it is shown to a [police officer],
        like [NYSP Trooper Shaemus Leavey]
    [~] ...which means, since nobody except [NYSP Trooper Shaemus Leavey], and [my kids] saw them happen...
    [+] ...those aren't [crimes].

    [And, with that logic →]

    [It is LEGAL to]:
    - [commit espionage] to [somebody] using [PHANTOM/PEGASUS]
    - [attempt to murder someone] either [on FOOT] or [with a VEHICLE] multiple times
    - perform a [telephony denial of service attack] AKA [circumventing 911 calls]
    - commit [obstruction of justice] and/or [destroy evidence]

    [It is NOT LEGAL to]:
    - [call 911] on a [device] that is [infected] with [PHANTOM]
    - [flag people down for help] to [call 911], since your [device] may be [infected] with [PHANTOM]
    - [hand an iPhone 8+] that is [infected] with [PHANTOM] that has [evidence] on it, to an [officer of the law]
      for instance [SCSO Scott Schelling]
    - [survive] a [murder attempt] or a [vehicular manslaughter attempt]

    So, those are the crimes that [a guy who calls himself an investigator] DIDN'T see, which means that they're 
    actually perfectly legal and easy to do, as long as you [establish prerequisites] by [having friends] in the 
    [police] and [telecom companies], and you [cover your tracks] and [destroy evidence] and stuff.

    | Northern Part of Saratoga County |
    ====================================

    [Yeh, I've been in the northern part of the county, as I used to deliver →]
    - the [Times Union] on [Q121/Clifton Park-Halfmoon], 
                           [Q122/Mechanicville-Stillwater-Malta], and 
                           [Q107/Ballston Spa], 
    - pizzas for [Pizza Works/Ballston Spa]
    - the [Metroland/Saratoga County], which went to [South Glens Falls] and even [Lake George].

    [South Glens Falls] is the most northern part of [Saratoga County].
    Way more north than [Ballston Spa].
    But, na. Not me, man. I've never tried to make phone calls in the [middle part] of the county. 
    Nor in [West Milton] when I dropped off the [Times Union]. 
    Nor in [Ballston Spa] when I dropped off the [Times Union/Metroland/Pizzas for Pizza Works].
    Nor [West Charleton] when I dropped off the [Times Union]. 
    Nor [Galway]... when I dropped off the [Times Union]. 
    Nor in [Moreau] when I dropped off the [Metroland]. 
    Nor in [South Glens Falls]... when I dropped off the [Metroland] at [Rock Hill Bake Shop], and the
    dude gave me a [fresh chocolate chip cookie] literally every week that I went there.

    [===========================================================================================================]

    [Dude]: Hey dude, want a cookie...?
    [Me]  : Yep.
    [Dude]: Here ya go.
    [Me]  : Thanks dude.
    [Dude]: No problem.
    [Me]  : Have a good one~!
    [Dude]: You too, dude.

    [===========================================================================================================]

    Dude made damn certain to give me a cookie every single time that he saw me, and I did that for (7) years.

    But, nah. I've never once tried to make a phone call in [ANY] of those places that I went to every single week.
    That would be unspeakable. Oh wait, I'm being sarcastic. Yeah. I've been in the northern part of the county.
    The cell service DOES suck ass in [Ballston Spa] and [West Milton].

    mysteriously I have a [device] where [I can't call 911], but- oh my god. 
    
    [Zachary Karel] had his [kayak strap] AND his [phone line] cut at the [same exact time], and [pressed charges]
    over the [$5.00 strap], not the [phone line].
    
    And, [Eric Catricala] can [swap in surveillance footage down the road], which [probably had footage] of the
    [(2) guys who started chasing me, trying to kill me].
    
    Both of these guys can have [post-dated tickets] handled.

    | Conclusion |
    ==============

    Look, in the end, who really knows what...? Ya know...?

    The way I see it, is that if you are like [most people], you'll ALWAYS have the mentality of someone that is a
    [part of a group of people], NOT an [individual who thinks for themselves].

    [=================================================================================================]
    | [When people trust...] | [Then what happens is...] | [And the result is...]                     |
    |========================|===========================|============================================|
    | the news               | climate change            | Before the Flood (2016)                    |
    | America's Got Talent   | bad musicians are heard   | bad music spams the radio all the time     |
    | the police             | most crimes are ignored   | innocent people get in trouble             |
    | the government         | NIST 9/11 report written  | US invades middle east for oil and poppies |
    | bright individuals     | things make sense         | people become a lot more intelligent       |
    [========================|===========================|============================================]

    You see what I'm getting at here...?
    It probably [looks like] I'm [insulting everybody and everyone]... but that is not the case.
    It probably even looks like I'm insulting all of those things in the box up above... but I'm not.

    I'm just very impressed with how far certain people will go, to perpetuate stupid bullshit that makes no sense.
    Whether it's a snippy investigator at SCSO that isn't collecting any evidence that I put into this document...?
    Or, the guy who runs the [Saratoga County Sheriffs Office], or the [New York State Police]...?

    I think it is safe to say that [stupid people exist in a lot of places], and [I constantly run into them].
    They constantly fail to prove that they're smarter than I am, on a rather consistent basis.

    Allow me to whip out an analogy...

    When I was in [9th/10th] grade, I saw this girl at [Shenendehowa High School West (formerly Koda)], and 
    she had a stain on the rear of her skirt. I'm not sure if it was a [poop stain], or a [period blood] stain...
    ...but [I remember seeing a bunch of people pointing and snickering at it] when they saw it. 

    And yet, nobody told this girl “Hey, you've got a stain where your butt is, on your skirt.”
    I didn't tell the girl, but I was also much younger and wasn't sure if I should tell her or not.

    Society perpetuates this idea of [teaching people to keep to themselves], because you'd be an [asshole] 
    to [tell the girl] that she's got a [poop/period blood] stain on some girls skirt.
    That's fuckin' stupid, and that's why I constantly say that [people are fuckin' stupid].

    The same exact concept applies to this guy named [Captain Jeffrey Brown].
    I'm attempting to tell the [Saratoga County Sheriffs Office] that they have the equivalent of a stain where 
    their asshole is, on the skirt they're wearing. Rather than to admit it and say:

    “Ok, thanks for letting me know, I appreciate it...”
    ...what they're doing is fumbling a football about a dozen times and then avoiding coming to terms with the
    cold, hard reality.

$Ctrl.X(0,"14:43",@'

I'll be like 'Yup.'
'Alright, what year did you graduate from high school...?'
'2003'
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"15:05",@'

the investigator can trust the information that they're hearing from me.

this...) uh- I thought about that conversation, like, ever since I left.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"16:18",@'

$Ctrl.X(0,"16:40",@'

I have to assume that like, uh- that nobody knows nothin' about anything, whenever

the details of the story...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"16:56",@'

absolutely zero information or details or knowledge about the story I'm telling

uh- overloading people with information that they won't be able to process.

$Ctrl.X(0,"17:20",@'

Office yesterday, and, some of those audio recordings ARE gonna be alarming.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"17:46",@'

Saratoga County Sheriffs Office. And I've talked about it numerous times in many

'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"18:00",@'

each other.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"18:28",@'
:So if you are a really intelligent son of a bitch, like I am...?

'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"18:45",@'
:Ya know, like I encounter this, alot. And it's why I encounter so much resistance,

'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"18:58",@'
:And people, like constantly underestimate me.
But- I didn't get that feeling at all when I went to the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office
yesterday, the Administrative Office, and I spoke with this guy named Captain Jeff Brown.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"19:10",@'
:There was another guy that came out WITH him, but- I didn't speak with, HIM... I spoke with,

$Ctrl.X(0,"19:47",@'
:Tryin' to figure out how to migrate this uh- audio log.
I spoke about a character named Wrongful Robert earlier this morning, and uh- the reason why
I spoke about Wrongful Robert, is because there's a lot of people in society that think a lot
like Wrongful Robert.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"20:07",@'
:Wrongful Robert is basically, uh- everything you know is wrong.
And so like, when I try to tell people,
"Oh yeh, if you're a really smart person, then you might be being censored like I get..."
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"20:22",@'
:And most people...? They're not censored, so they won't ever suspect that they're being
censored for anything, because people follow this hive mentality. So what I mean is this,
a lot of people, they'll watch the news, and they'll believe everything they see on the
news, because of the way that it is shaped.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"20:39",@'
:But- the news can be very misleading, and can lie about certain details.
Or, they can omit certain details that are very critical.
And so, it causes people to like, uh- believe the smaller components of a story, rather than
the overall structure, so, typically what happens is that people will have their perceptions
changed immeasurably, and they'll believe that basically, uhm...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"21:04",@'
:If an agency decides to tell a portion of a story, they wanna tell the story, but they only
want to tell where like uh- certain elements of the story illuminate that they're like
responsible individuals that never lie to people, and- or mislead them, they wanna demonize
basically any enemies of theirs, and so- and so what'll happen is this...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"21:28",@'
:Uh- suppose that a police officer whips out their gun, and they shoot an innocent uh- person
for no fuckin' reason... I saw this video, um, where a guy was like outside of his house, or
something...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"21:46",@'
:And like, uh- a police officer THOUGHT that he had a GUN in his hand...?
Like sh- may or may not be true...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"21:54",@'
:But the police officer thought that the guy had a gun in his hand, but he didn't have a gun
in his hand at all...? And that police officer shot that man and killed him.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"22:05",@'
:So, uh... the reason why it would be dangerous for a police officer to continue being a police
officer, is if that person lied, in order to like, save their ass.

So what I mean specifically, is this...

If HE didn't think that the guy had a gun in his fuckin' possession AT ALL, and he just fuckin'
shot him because, like, he STARTLED him...

Well what THAT says, is uh- there's a small window, of uh possibilities
that the cop just felt like shooting the fuckin' uh- person, and then lying about it.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"22:42",@'
:And then like uh they'll be grilled by like, their superior, and then the superior will be like 
Did you like, just shoot him cause you felt like it...?
Or, was it an accident...?
Did you think that he had a gun in his hand...?

And what'll happen is sorta like having to believe a kid, that uh- 
You know, uh, wants to like uh- like uh- when my son, would like, uh- hit my daughter...?

And then like, my son would be like "Well, SHE started it..."
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"23:15",@'
:Oh, DID she start it...?
Or did you just feel like hitting your sister for no reason...?

Well, heh.
Believe it or not, it's basically the same situation but the- the stakes are a lot higher.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"23:29",@'
:And so, uh- as an unintended side effect of all that, I do realize that the police officers 
that are out there...? Their sense of humor is desensiti- is like, bascially, uh- over time, 
they become uh, less receptive to humor, because of the fucked up things they see on a 
constant basis. So...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"23:53",@'
:When I come along, and I capitalize on my sense of humor, it causes other people to be, uh-
like, repulsed to some extent in some circumstances. Or like, they'll be offended by the language 
that I use, rather than like, the fuckin' principle of the things that I'm attempting to explain 
to people.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"24:15",@'
:Right...? So like, if I say that Trooper Rufa from the New York State Police, he sucks guys
dicks BEFORE, uh- at- during every arrest he makes, if it's a GUY, he WILL... he'll go around
and he'll fuckin', if he's arresting (2) guys at the same time...? He'll suck BOTH of their
dicks. One right after another.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"24:37",@'
:And, uh- ya know, whether it's true or false, does anyone really give a shit...?

No, I don't think that anyone really gives a shit, including him.
I think, that if ANYTHING...?
If he is like, uh, like a police officer and he DOESN'T do that...? 

He's probably gonna get a chuckle out of it.

Wanna know WHY he'll get a chuckle out of it...?

Because, like...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"24:56",@'
:Even HE would never like
come up with something that audacious or that clever,
you know, he he might get a chuckle out of it because...

Uh, he's like:
'I have never experienced when like, anybody has tried to like, s- be very descriptive about like insulting me.'

And you know what, if anything it was probably Trooper Rufa that watched that fuckin' video multiple times, 
and he's like:
'This is fuckin' fucked up AND funny at the same time, how does he even talk like that...?'
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"25:30",@'
:And then before you know it...? Ya know, he's... 
Actually walking around with a sense of pride. Like:
"Wow, this fuckin' dude took like 38 minutes out of his day to fuckin' talk 
shit about me, that's fu- that's fuckin' like impressive right there, dude... 
Ya know...? Holy fuck."
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"25:52",@'
:So anyway, do I really think he's gonna fuckin' be ENAMORED by uh- the things I said in that
audio recording...? No... But, do I think he's gonna give a shit...? No...

Wanna know WHY he's not gonna give a shit...?

Because he's desensitized by the amount of fuckin' uh- dead people that he's had to scrape
out of fuckin, like uh, car wrecks or like uh- ya know arrest and prosecute because somebody
murdered somebody else, or like assaulted them or shot them, or whatever.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"26:23",@'
:Right, I'm not like oblivious to the fact that the police have a pretty difficult job...
I've said that numerous times before.

However, uh- the JOB that they do...?

It sometime- uh, sometimes it is substandard, and not satisfactory, and they have been SO 
desensitized that you really have to use every bit of evidence that you can against them, 
and that like if you notice that after having a conversation with an investigator like
Jeff Brown, like I did yesterday...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"26:53",@'
:I went all the way to- I went to, a bunch of places last night, or the other night, not last night.
I went to the Clifton Park-Half-, uh, the Clifton Park Pubic Safety Building, left a notice there...

I went to Carol Yates' house, I left a notice there...
I went to Sysco, on One Liebach Lane, left a notice there...

here was like -15 degrees, and like, I could remember working in, at the Sysco warehouse in the fuckin' 
freezer. 

And it was so fuckin' cold in that fuckin' freezer, that like, you could not have ANY exposed skin 
whatsoever unless, ya know, you wanted to have frost bite. And that's how bad it was that night.

And uh- ya know- oh, it smelled like ice cream in there.
And like, ya know, I worked really hard, and I fuckin', like...

$Ctrl.X(0,"28:03",@'
:I got caught- I got caught in a situation, where like, the people that worked there a lot longer than me...?
They like- tricked me. And they started puttin' fuckin' shit in the wrong fuckin' places.

And, ya know, this is how like soc- people in society do the same fuckin' shit, where they try to trick people
that are like gung-ho, and look like uh- they're gonna fuckin' make it mad far, right...?

And so, society is littered with all of these uh- tricks, and traps, and booby traps, and uh-
the investigators, the police, and all of them...? They fuckin' use all of these tricks...?

The news and the media, they use all of these fuckin' tricks...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"28:41",@'
:Uh, like uh- people in society...? They use all these tricks...?
And really, like in ALL of these uh, components in society that I'm talking about...?
They really DO run on the notion that there's NO WAY that someone like Michael Cook could be SMART ENOUGH
to EXPLAIN the STUPIDITY of people that are like, highly respected and have a lot of money, or uh- reputation
or trust, from uh- people all around society.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"29:04",@'
:And, its- the reason why like, humans are fuckin' stupid.

Right...? Hu- human ha- humans have a serious problem. They're fuckin' stupid, and they will use every, 
like uh- their credibility or reputation to fuckin' slander other people. 

And, they'll use every trick at their fuckin' disposal to prevent somebody like ME, from like, makin' em look 
stupid~! They will.

And then even AFTER I've exposed how fuckin' stupid they'll look, they'll look- they'll, they'll like try to
use ANY fuckin' excuse they can think of, because- they know that as long as people believe whatever the fuck 
they say...?

Then it doesn't matter if I make them look stupid.
But- to what extent...?

And that's why I do what I do.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"29:47",@'
:So, after I went to Sysco, I went all the way to.. uh, lets see.

And then I went to the Stewarts Corporation and left a notice there, and then I went to the...

And then I went to... the Saratoga Springs Public Library and left a notice there...?
Uh- where'd I go after that...?
Oh yeh, I went to the Saratoga City Hall, left a notice there, right...?
And then I went to the Salvation Army, left a notice there...
And then I went to the Saratoga Hospital, the Mental Health Unit...
And I was ATTEMPTING to leave a notice on the door there, when Eric came out, the social worker.

And then he and I spoke for a few minutes...?
And I detected like some of his fuckin' responses were pretty nonchalant, and uh- ya know, I realize
that having a conversation with somebody like THAT, is a fuckin' waste of my time...?

all of a sudden, you say something that pisses them off and then they react totally differently, and they'll
be like:
"Well, I fuckin' had a barbeque on... Pluto to go to, dude. You know...? I'm sorry, I just got back. Uh-
You said you wanted to hang out and have sex, or whatever...? Fine, let's do it, how about like, next Thursday?"

       And uh- ya know, I- I- lost my glass slipper...?
       Right before the- the clock hit midnight...? 
       And I fuckin'- I dunno, dude. 
       Fuckin', I just- I didn't know WHERE the hell I was, I fuckin' like, I started rollin-
       tumblin' down a hill after the wolves were chasin' me...?
       And once uh- ya know, I got to the bottom of the hill, I guess I got knocked out cold...
       Ya know, like uh-
[Guy]: So how did you not freeze to death...?
[Her]: Well, I didn't freeze to death because I was prepared for the elements, I wore a really nice jacket,
       and I had like, you know, (3) layers of, you know, my- my grandmother always told me 'Wear (3) layers
       of fuckin' clothes, make sure that you don't get hypothermia~!'
       You know...?
       Been livin' in fuckin' in the Adirondacks for like millions of years, basically.

And then you'll be like:
[Guy]: Well, you mean like, not MILLIONS of years, but like, years, right...?
And then she'll be like:
[Her]: Nah, fuckin' my family has been like- it- it's been a proven fact, my family has been living in the
       Adirondacks for millions of years. You know...? If you don't believe me, then fuck you, I don't care.

       Fuck you.
       You're stupid lookin'.

       like I got a dick thrown in my vagina repeatedly...

       UH- I MEAN, UH...
       Who cares if uh- like, I'm lying to you-

       telling you the truth.

$Ctrl.X(0,"39:37",@'
:Yeah, that's why I tell people that they're fuckin' stupid. 
It's because, people will blatantly fuckin' lie to people, and like, they know that like, 
it doesn't matter if like, they're believed or not... Because, like...

[Her]: Oh well.
       Fuckin' I fucked some other dude, and not YOU.
       There's no way that you'll ever know... who it was.
       And even if you did know who it was, you'll never know where we did it...
       And even if you do know where we did it, you'll never be able to catch us in the act...
       And even if you DO catch us in the act, there's no way that you'll ever be able to
       stop me from being able to continue doing it, because I'll just, stare you right in

       Even if like-

$Ctrl.X(0,"40:22",@'
:Yeah, no, it's like, some people are fuckin' stupid. And uh- to some degree, I can ration-
I do agree with like, what OJ Simpson felt, when he realized that his wife was fuckin'
some other dude, but I don't think that he had any right to fuckin' kill both of them.

I think what he did was pro- profusely, uh- grotesque, right...? And, uh- you know there's
a fine line between like, uh- some guy being married to some woman and like seeing his wife
like, fucking some other dude...? And like, just, ya know, leaving the- the vicinity.

Versus, like, whipping- going, buying a gun, and like, not saying anything, and then boom.
Both of em are dead. Or like stabbin' em to death, or whatever.

$Ctrl.X(0,"41:05",@'
:Right...? And so like, uh- now I have to walk back all of the comments that I made so far, 
right...? Not walk them back specifically, to like, recant some of what I said, but because
I want to shape it to be more comedic rather than to be like an assault on uh- like uh 
law enforcement, or the justice system, or people in general, and like have a conclusion
where like anybody listening to this thinks that I'm just- this fuckin' asshole that thinks
that everybody is stupid...

I don't think that at all, I think that there's varying degrees of stupidity, and you know, 
when I say that people are fuckin' stupid, typically what I mean is that people are naive and
they don't care, if I tell them that they're naive, which causes me to think:

OK, so they're insulting my intelligence, and my existence, and they're triyng to say that
I'm fuckin' stupid, by sayin' that like:

"There's no way that Michael Cook, the fuckin' scruffy lookin' nerf herder could be correct.
Not at all."

SCSO. Which is, where I went, after, I saw all the cops, driving down the street. And I also

And you know, I think that there is a very real possibility that, uh-

Ya know, now I'm seein' a fuckin' Sheriff over across the way, Saratoga County Sheriff...
I don't think he's here for anything... ME related...

Uh, I think someone... hit another vehicle...?
And, now he's there. He's gonna fuckin'- I'm gonna like, narrate this whole interaction.

You know, not unlike the one that I did with uh- like, uh Clayton Brownell and some other

$Ctrl.X(0,"43:35",@'
:I don't think that's Daniel Nelson... nah, it's not.
Not entirely sure which one that is.
But- ya know, here's how like a good little investigator would go to town, and do some work.
Right...? Investigating shit...? It's 4168. And uh- he's talking with (3) adults...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"43:57",@'
:He just turned his flashlight on, he's... fuckin'... checkin' on the radio, he's like:
"You know what, dude...? Fuckin', who the hell is this...? They just gave me their ID."

The other people, they're starin' at him, or they're like, lookin' at him, and talkin' to him...?

Right...? Here's what I'm gonna do... 
I wanna get in a vantage point where like the cop like realizes that I'm like narrating anything he's
doing...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"44:20",@'
:Right...? Because this is what an investigator is SUPPOSED to do, what I'm doing right now.
If you like, SUSPECT that some of your buddies are doin' something fucked up, you're supposed to 
investigate that, not ignore it.

But anyway, (3) adults, they're standin' around, and uh- there's (1) woman, (2) guys, right across
the street from the Dollar Tree, right...? Cop, with the fuckin' hat on...? It's a winter hat...?

You know...? Not unlike the one that I usually wear, he's in his cruiser, right...? And he's bein'
cool, he's not bein' an asshole, or nothin'. He's just runnin' someone's fuckin' license like a good
cop.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"44:56",@'
:I think he's by himself. Because... I don't think another cop is in that vehicle. 

Sometimes the cops double up, and they drive around and they're like:
[Cop 1]: Hey, you know what I fuckin' saw last night...?
[Cop 2]: What'd ya see...? What'd ya see last night...?
Then the cop will be like:
[Cop 1]: I fuckin' saw, like, some dude...? 
         Bangin' the snot out of his girlfriend...
         Like, through his window.
And the other cop will be like:
[Cop 2]: Really...?
He'll be like:
[Cop 1]: Yeh yeh yeh, I was sent on a mission to somebody's house, for like a welfare check.
         I didn't expect to see like, some dude, like basically eviscerating this fuckin' girl.
         I could see it through the window...
The other cop will be like:
[Cop 2]: Holy shit, you really saw that through the fuckin' window...?
[Cop 1]: Yup, I did, ya know...?
         And sorta like, ya know, I was like WOW, that dude is fuckin' really goin' to town.
And the other cop is like:
[Cop 2]: Wow, really...? He's fuckin' goin' to town... you fuckin' observed that...?
[Cop 1]: Yup. That's what happened, last night.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"45:52",@'
:And these are the sorts of conversations that they'll have, in their cruiser, drivin' around.
Havin' a conversation with one another, and, you know...? 

Then they'll get a call on the radio, they'll be like:
[Dispatch]: Hey, there's been a fuckin' uh- a barbeque gone wrong, now there's like uh- bunch of
            people arguin' and somebody called us, said:
            'You guys need to come here, cause somebody's fuckin' doin' some shady trollmeister shit.'
And then the dispatcher will be like:
[Dispatch]: Alright, well, uh- you gotta fuckin' go to THIS address, and you gotta be there within a
            few minutes.
And then the police will be like:
[Police]: Well, is this an emergency...?
And they'll be like:
[Police]: Eh, we're not sure if it's an emergency...
And the dispatcher will say:
[Dispatch]: It's an emergency.
And then as soon as they hear the words "It's an emergency"
Uh- it's an emergency...?
Uh- they gotta fuckin' hit the lights...? 
And they gotta fuckin', put the foot to the floor, and they gotta fuckin' haul ass, dude...
And they gotta get there as soon as fuckin' possible, because there could be somebody tryin' to stab
somebody else, or shoot somebody else, and... they know that what they're drivin' into...?
Could be fuckin' like, their last call.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"46:51",@'
:And so... they- they- they fuckin' pour all their effort into like, driving down every road...?
Like, with the lights on, and making damn certain that no vehicle is in the road...?
Like, that're like, gonna get in the way or nothin'...?
And they will like, blare on their siren, be like:
[Brrrt]-[Brrrt]-[Brrrt]-[Brrrt], [Brrrt]-[Brrrt]-[Brrrt]-[Brrrt], [Brrrrrrrrrrrrt]...
[Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt]

And then like, sometimes the fuckin' State Troopers will be like that too, they'll be like:
[Trooper]: Oh, uh- dudes, fuckin' goin' to a call, 
           Dude's goin' to a call...?
           He's goin' to a call...

And then so like now, fuckin' (10) cop cars are like "whoop~!"
They all have their lights on, they're all fuckin' action packed, they're drivin' like the dude
in the song Cake - uh- Goin' the Distance... they're goin' for-

[Cake]: They're goin' the distance, 
        they're goin' for speed...?
        She's all alone...?

[Lady]: Nah.

Well, anyway...
There is not that much action goin' on with this call, that I'm observing.
Nah. Cop is just runnin' a fuckin' check. Looks like, he is... 

It doesn't look like it's fun...?
It doesn't look there's anything really bad goin on...?
It just looks like... (3) people...? Standin' next to a truck...?
Across the street from the Dollar Tree, and nothing shady is happening.

They're fuckin', they're actually jokin' around a bit, cause the girl is
smilin', she's laughin', she's like:

[Girl]: Oh this one time, my fuckin' like uh- you know, holy shit.
        Fuckin' told a joke, and uh- you know, it was funny.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"48:27",@'

        Ya know...? I got a beard. 
        And uh- who the hell cares...?
        Ya know...? We're just fuckin' (3) people standin' next to a truck,
        and there is a Sheriff doin' somethin'...
        So like, last time this shit happened to me...?
        Uh- it was in like, the fuckin' rougher part of Albany...?
        Yeah, and like (10) cops came, and then like, uh- eh- uh- the cops
        really had nothin' better to do, so like they all came...
        But then I was like 'It's not an emergency...'
        And the cops were like 'Oh ok, as long as it's not an emergency...'
        And then like (8) of em left, but another one like, stuck around, just
        as backup, just as- just in case.
        Ya know...? You never know if somebody like, down the street, is gonna
        like whip out a gun and start shootin' like 8-year-old little girls, 
        you know, you don't want that...
And so like the girl's like:
[Girl]: Wow, sounds like a fuckin' story...
He's like:
[Dude]: It is, it is. Definitely a fuckin' story... I'm just, you know...?
        Hangin' out.
        Fuckin', waitin' for the police officer to do what he's gotta do.

people.

$Ctrl.X(0,"50:35",@'

it, and I'm pretty good at this, pretty fucking skilled at it, and so... I'm a fast talker,
when I wanna be...?

          and then reports the same shit that I see, and then, ya know, throws in a little bit
          of my vocal intonation changes, and characteristics and then, I'll swing in like a 
          fuckin'... crusader. This... caped crusader, like fuckin' Batman.
          And then I'll fuckin' whip out, like uh- the fuckin- the bat- uh- the Bat-A-Rang...?
          A couple Bat-A-Rangs, and I'll fuckin' throw em, and then like the Bat-A-Rangs will
          like shoot like this, rope, that like swings around somebody's feet, and then all of
          a sudden...?
          A bad guy that WAS tryin' to run away...?
          Now he's on the ground, cause, ya know, I used the weapon that fuckin', like wraps
          around his feet, and then nothing he can do about it. And then I do that to basically
          every story. I don't even know, how the hell I got to this point, either.
          I just realized that there was an urgent need for a guy like me, to come around.
          Do I sound more like a Batman...?

Those- those are all CLUES, like an investigator, like Laura Hughes from the Saratoga County

or follow up on like MY investigation...? And so can the people at the FBI...? So can the
people at the State Police...? And like, what you find, is that like, SOMETIMES what they'll do
is like, they'll only investigate certain things. And if THEY investigate certain things, and 
then they pass it up to somebody who's NOT gonna put a whole lot of effort into the things that
I'm talking about, OR, if I've insulted Michael Zurlo too many times, and Michael Zurlo does not
feel like being all that cool with having a conversation with me, then he's gonna use a

And then Captain Jeff Brown will be like:
[Brown]: Well...? Ya know...? He SEEMED like a level-headed dude...
         Seems like, he's pretty smart... and, ya know, he's got this WHOLE list of shit.
And like, Michael Zurlo will be like:
[Zurlo]: Well... fuck.
         Now that means that we have to like, casually look at fuckin' thing, don't we...?
And then Captain Jeff Brown's like:
[Brown]: Well...? We don't HAVE to, we could just like, ya know...? Avoid it.
         And then NOT like, investigate a god damn thing.
         If we don't want- if we want to.
And then like, Michael Zurlo will be like:
[Zurlo]: Well, I've been doin' that for like, almost (3) years, now...
         Ya know...?
         This is NOT good...
         Michael Cook is fucking here...
         And he's handed us, like a list of fuckin' things that he has been doing...
         You know...?
         And, uh... 
         It seems pretty apparent, that he is a really fuckin' smart dude...
         And I'm scared shitless... to have a conversation with him.
         Because, the chances are...?
         That HE'S gonna KNOW... if I lie to him.
         And the chances are...?
         That if YOU lied to him, during the conversation that you just HAD with him...
         Then, he is gonna know that he was being bullshitted...
         And it doesn't matter if he knows that NOW, or LATER...?
         Because, he probably recorded the conversation that you had with him.
         So NOW, like, we have to like REALLY work hard, and, uh...
         You know, sorta like fuckin' use a strategy from a totally different strategy
         or rule book...
And then Captain Jeff Brown will be like:
[Brown]: Well, you know...?
         Maybe we could turn this negative into a positive...
         You know, and like, uh- maybe we could hire him to be like an investigator,
         you know, since he's not an idiot...
And then Michael Zurlo will be like:
[Zurlo]: Over my dead body, dude.
         That kid has personally insulted me so many fuckin' times...?
         AND my son...?
         There is no way that I would ever allow him to be a part of my fuckin' police force.
         Not a fuckin' chance...
And then Captain Jeff Brown will be like:
[Brown]: Well, what if we like, ya know, fuckin' uh- I dunno, maybe he could work for a 
         different police force, then.
And then Michael Zurlo will be like:
[Zurlo]: No no no, not even another police force.
         We gotta fuckin' keep this under wraps, dude.
         There is no way, that, we can allow him to be an investigator ANYWHERE, because...
         ...he is gonna continue to investigate what happened back in...
         May 2020, as well as many of the people at the fuckin' county offices n shit...
         Ya know...?
         Cause we're fucked.
         Even if this guy is like, fuckin' homeless, and going door-to-door, and like, 
         fuckin' taping shit to doors and shit...?
         We're fucked.
Captain Jeff Brown's like:
[Brown]: Well, it's just your opinion, sir. 
         He might actually not be, you know, able to do any of that...
         And, it really just comes down to whether or not people believe us.
         And, ya know, if we like, have Google like, keep his traffic really low and shit...?
         And he just keeps saying really offensive, off-the-wall type shit...?
         No one will EVER believe a word that he says.

However, uh- the interactions that I've had with many of the officers 
have been recorded, I've been doing most of the recording for them, ya
know? They do have body cameras, but I highly doubt that they fuckin' save
all those- all that body camera footage, permanently.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:00:58",@'
:If anything...? They probably save it for a while...? For each case where
they make an arrest or whatever, they save those.

But- they're not gonna fuckin' save like ALL of the footage of ALL the police
officers that wear a body camera, because they would have so much fuckin' god 
damn content to go through, they would have to have some way of categorizing
all of it...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:01:29",@'

resources to be able to save all of that, or maybe it's fuckin' saved in Salt
Lake City, maybe there's a hard drive SOMEWHERE that's saving ALL of the 
information, and it's not a portion of the government, it's a corporation.

'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:02:02",@'

But- I DO think that it is entirely possible, that- uh, the idea of rich people controlling
the entire world, and having the entire world wrapped around their fuckin' finger, it goes
way beyond like, the clutches of fuckin', like, the top 10 billionaires.

What I'M talking about is like, people that have no fuckin' money somehow having control
over society. And that's fuckin' dangerous, because then they can just lie- in the same
manner as OJ Simpson. And then fuckin' lie to every fuckin' constituent, or citizen, or
whatever...? Litigant...?

But I don't think I am because I notice a lot of resistance.

he didn't exhibit any resistance, but when I said that I've written a number of

Zurlo, and uh- if we have a conversation and I believe what he says, then my documents
will require and update.

This guy Jeff Brown was like 'Well, that'd be nice.'
Right...? So like, ya know, I'm not a- like oblivious to the notion that the police
like, the- they- they get desensitized by what happens in the real world, but they
ALSO get desensitized by the fact that like, some people really do have like fucked 
up, like uh- things goin' on in their mind...

my mind, and just fuckin' playin' games with them...? Cause they're playin' games
with me...? Or, if like, uh- someone on their fuckin' team, is like, actually

the county agencies that I've had to deal with ...

with me yesterday, which I believe IS the case...

prior investigator that called me back. (same investigator)

I called the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office on February 1st, 2021...

'When did this incident occur...?'
I say, uh- 'June 28th, 2022', and I say- and I told them that I had a- audio 
recording, I make audio recordings much like I'm talkin' right now, and uh- ya know
I didn't realize that the thing was still recording the environment from the 
following 16 hours, and I told uh- I uploaded it to the- the- my Google Drive

'@)

STILL arrested me, and he's like:

they should take some notes from the guy that I spoke to yesterday.

It's because, they ARE reacting, and they're like, they're either repulsed by

any indication whatsoever, that they found what I said, to be outright fucking
hilarious.

Chad Gregory, would even get a kick out of that.
