:[Saturday, February 18th, 2023], [Michael Cook] speaking.
It's currently, [5:56pm]...?

I'm making this [audio log] to talk about...
...terms that are rather [offensive], which I sort of capitalized on [earlier today], uhm- 
However, I'd like to [expand] upon that because...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:20","00:41",@'
:I know that uh- some of my language is uh- it OFFENDS certain people, right...?

Or maybe my language will offend EVERYBODY, right...?

And then, I have to [rewind] to like an [audio recording] that I made uh- a few months ago,
sorta like uh, [observing] and [analyzing] some uh- of uh [George Carlin]'s
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:41","00:57",@'
:Uh- rhetoric, right...?

Regard-, uh- especially regarding the, his skit from like the late- sometime in the 70's,
regarding the 7 words that you'll never hear on the fuckin' TV.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:57","01:12",@'
:Right so, already right there, I'm already whippin' out the F word.

So I'm sorta like, bein' a trollmeister 5000, already. 

But I'm not being a REAL trollmeister... not at all.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:12","01:32",@'
:Nah, I think the problem is that...

[I'm being limited by people that are fuckin' stupid], and they ha- the reason why
they're doing it is because [they're jealous of how fuckin' intelligent I am], and they
will use [every fucking trick] or, uh- [trick in the book], to try to [limit] me...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:32","01:50",@'
:And then make, uh- [OTHER people's perceptions] of what I say or do...
to seem so [OFFENSIVE], that like, I should [practically] be in a [prison] or a 
[jail cell], for the amount of [foul-ass fuckin' things that I say].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:50","02:08",@'
:Right...?

So what I'm doing, is I'm [exhibiting] a [sense] of being [more sophisticated] than
[a lot of people], who like [follow the rules], and got to where they we- where 
they are in society, by [doing what they were told], and being a [good little boy] or
[girl], that ya know, [followed instructions]...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"02:08","02:29",@'
:Right...?

I can convey a sense of me being [just as sophisticated] as uh- [Rex Smith] over at the
[Times Union], or any of the uh the journalists that work at the [Times Union], or the
[Gazette], or the [Saratogian], or like the [New York Post], or [WTEN] or [WRGB], or 
[WNYT], right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"02:29","03:00",@'
:I [exhibit] a [sense] of uh- being [extremely sophisticated] when I talk, right...?

And then when like, I capitalize on something [offensive] and it goes against the
conventional mold of society...

...I think what happens is that somebody, that's been trying to contain me, wants to
make it so that- I- I give up on myself, or uh- other people, THEY give up on like, 
uh, [reading] or [absorbing] my [content] or [whatever I have to say or produce].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"03:00","03:20",@'
:Right...?

And, this typically happens when I insult [certain highly respected people], right...?

And then like, I'll notice like, uhm, some of these signs that I have [hit the nail] 
right on the fuckin' head... when, [some of the numbers that I'm seeing]...?

They're being [skewed], right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"03:20","03:39",@'
:So like if I- lets- let me put it into perspective.

So, if I [send a text message] to this- [some girl], that like, [always] wants to
[have sex]- have sex with me, right...?
Right...?

And uh- [had sex with her for many many weeks], every single time we started messaging, 
she's like:
[Girl]: Hey, wanna have sex...?

...right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"03:39","03:59",@'
:So like if I establish that as a [baseline], and I know that if I text some girl about
havin' sex with her...? 

She's gonna [text me back] in a [few minutes] to like an [hour], she might be bus- like, 
let's say on the [worst occasion], she might be [so busy] that she doesn't get back to me
within [like an hour or two]... right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"03:59","04:35",@'
:So, if I establish that as a [baseline]...?

And then like, something fuckin' happens, or like, I say something that really upsets her, 
or whatever...? And then I like, try to use the same tactics...? Even more...? And like,
she starts to come up with excuses like:

[Girl]: Oh, I uh- fell asleep... or 
        Oh, um... I was- I was going like, grocery shopping with my mom, 
        and I left my phone at my other house...
        I just got back, is- I know it's been like (3) days, but you know, um...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"04:35","04:50",@'
:So, what I'm doing right there, is I'm illuminating there's a reason WHY someone would be-
would say misleading things to me. Or, wouldn't be reporting the same sort of uh- events.

Or, I might like- ok. So...

Right...? 
Everybody else...?

:So, [our society unwittingly trains people to throw out the idea of] uh- [remembering

'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"05:43","06:14",@'
:I've been uh- consistently uploading videos over the last, you know, couple of weeks,
every day, maybe (1) video or multiple...?

Not all of the videos have gotten attention, or like uh- whatever...?

But um, I've seen a consistent effort from like somebody working at either [Google],
or somewhere in between, me and [Google], like, seeing the content that I'm like, 
uploading...? 

And then responding to it, and like saying:
[Somebody]: Yeh, that's cool. 
            Your content's cool or whatever...

Right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"06:14","07:02",@'
:So, what this causes me, to believe, is that it's ALWAYS a factor.

And uh- if you start out doing something that upsets people at [Google], then 
basically it's like uh- it's basically like uh- [putting yourself in a box], and
you're a plant, and uh- ya know the [maximum shape] that you will ever grow as that
plant, is the [size of that box].

You'll never be able to outgrow the box.

You'll always be confined within the box, because, you know, somebody made damn
certain that like your [maximum shape] would be the size of that box, and therefore, 
that allows you to only, like uh- to influence a certain number of people.

#=========================
| Societal Expectations |
=========================

Society forces people to believe that you'll never outgrow the box.
That's because people have a problem with determining whether their authority is CREDIBLE.

So if someone who [casually strokes their dick all day in a bathtub] happens to be in a position of IMPORTANCE
or SIGNIFICANCE, then they can literally say things that are [blatantly false], and [people will believe them].

"You'll never be able to outgrow the box."

          like HBO doing stand up specials or some shit...?

===================

I used to think that it came down to [not being funny], but now I know 
that [there is a group of people that work really hard] to [prevent people] 
from thinking some things are [funny], [comical], or otherwise.
    
This is called "stupid people that try to control what's funny or cool"

#===========================
| Wide-Ranging Conspiracy |
===========================
    
Yeah, because I was [arrested] over a [post-dated ticket] after my [iPhone 8+] was [disabled].
It was [disabled by the manufacturer, Apple Corporation] after I [showed a video] to [NYSP Shaemus Leavey] 
at [05/27/20 0900].

That video being the one I recorded outside of the [Catricala Funeral Home] from [05/25/20 2343] to [05/26/20 0004]
of [(2) dudes using a DANGEROUS ESPIONAGE TOOL DESIGNED TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET SMARTPHONES CALLED "PHANTOM"].

In that video, these [(2) dudes/queers] appeared to be right smack dab in the middle of [attempting to murder me].

Maybe there is no [wide-ranging conspiracy] at all, and it just LOOKS like [Eric Catricala had (2) different events
merged together into a single incident (3) days late, and had (0) evidence of me really doing a god damn thing].

Oh wait, [I have evidence that could corroborate HIS side of the story]...
It's just that [the evidence I have would contradict the reported time], as well as [insert the record]: 
[SCSO-2020-028501].

[Nothing suspicious about any of this shit in the least (sarcasm).] 

Meanwhile, [I have like dozens of fucking pictures, as well as a few AUDIO RECORDINGS], and... 
[SOMEHOW I get arrested for cutting a fucking $5.00 kayak strap at 1769 Route 9, on a post-dated ticket]. 

The [PHONE LINE] that [I SEVERED] because I was attempting to call 911 SOMEHOW, [NOT] being the reason for 
arresting me.

Why did I cut the phone line, is [not a question any investigator nor police officer has asked me].
I would've thought at the very least, some dude from SCSO would've approached me and been like...

[===========================================================================================================]

[Guy] : What the actual fuck, dude...?
[Me]  : What...?
[Guy] : So you fuckin' cut some dude's phone line, didn't ya...?
[Me]  : Well, yeh.
[Guy] : Yeah well, why the hell would you do something crazy like that...?
        You done messed up [A-A-Ron]...
[Me]  : It's cause I was trying to call (911).
[Guy] : *rolls his eyes* Buddy, everybody tries to call (911).
        *shakes head* I don't even wanna hear it, I gotta arrest you for that...

[^ what never happened.]  

[===========================================================================================================]

But I'll tell ya, cause I had attempted to call (911) (2) times during this (90) minute event where (2) dudes 
were chasing me, and trying to kill me with a car parked ahead of the (3) of us in the [Lowes] parking lot. 
[Nothing shady or suspicious going on or whatever. Not at all.]

Oh, by the way, [the (2) dudes who tried to hit me with their fucking car, nobody is going after them].

As far as I know [your deputy] [Scott Schelling] went to [Center for Security] immediately after being at the 
[SECONDARY LOCATION] in the TICKET that you gave me in this phone call, and I believe that either HE or someone
else [destroyed the evidence of me calling (911) in front of the security camera at 05/26/20 0010].

Nothing suspicious about all this shit at all. 
Nah. 
Everybody follows the law at all times. (sarcasm)

Oh and by the way, the argument that I had with my mother on [06/28/22] is about the [wide-ranging conspiracy]
I just rattled off.
Oh by the way, [Paul Pelagalli] took custody of my fuckin' children away over this whole ordeal too.
Oh by the way, people think I went insane, cause some people are just plain old fuckin' stupid and lazy.

:Well, what I'm trying to say here, is that I'm giving you my recollection of that night.

The- the attack BEGAN, on [May 25th], and went INTO [May 26th], because it occurred at
approximately [11:30], I uploaded some files from the [Clifton Park Computer Answers]
network, because I used to manage it.

After I uploaded those files, a [couple of (gay looking) kids wearing glasses], [both
wearing hats], uhm, [approximately 6 feet tall], they were [walking on opposite sides
of the street] by the way, but it was rather late so it seemed strange that anybody was
out walking at all. (They both appeared to be sausage wreckers, not unlike Andy Cuomo)

Now, I had a short conversation with one of these kids, uh- and I said
'Hey, are you from around here...?' and he said,
'No, I AM from around here, but I moved away, and then I moved back.'

I was like 'Oh, ok.' and he walks on, and as he's walking on I type something into
my cell phone screen, and whatever I typed into my cell phone screen caused this kid
to STOP, dead in his tracks, when he looked at HIS cell phone, several feet away
(in front of the Catricala Funeral Home).

Maybe (50) feet away, maybe (100) feet.

Now, it could be coincidental (nah it wasn't, he tried to hit me when I was recording
the last audio recording I uploaded prior to the foot chase attack) that he just
happened to look at his phone at a certain time, and he just stopped dead in his
tracks, and it looked like he saw bad news. That's what MY impression was.

At any rate, a couple other things happened, uh- there was a kid at the laundromat
that night, pretty sure that place had surveillance footage but uh- there was a kid
in a black dodge, at that gas station, that was leaving.

| Obstructing Justice |
=======================

What about [multiple fellow officers] [obstructing justice]...?
Or the [telephony DDOS attacks]...?
[Pretty sure those are crimes, too].

MAYBE, as long as THOSE [crimes] are [committed when nobody is looking]...?
Then they're not [reportable] nor [arrestable crimes].

[So, someone can →]

[+] [destroy evidence] of [911 calls/attempted murder/vehicular manslaughter]
[~] ...as long as...
[+] [any evidence of those crimes being committed] is [destroyed] AFTER it is shown to a [police officer],
    like [NYSP Trooper Shaemus Leavey]
[~] ...which means, since nobody except [NYSP Trooper Shaemus Leavey], and [my kids] saw them happen...
[+] ...those aren't [crimes].

[And, with that logic →]

[It is LEGAL to]:
- [commit espionage] to [somebody] using [PHANTOM/PEGASUS]
- [attempt to murder someone] either [on FOOT] or [with a VEHICLE] multiple times
- perform a [telephony denial of service attack] AKA [circumventing 911 calls]
- commit [obstruction of justice] and/or [destroy evidence]

[It is NOT LEGAL to]:
- [call 911] on a [device] that is [infected] with [PHANTOM]
- [flag people down for help] to [call 911], since your [device] may be [infected] with [PHANTOM]
- [hand an iPhone 8+] that is [infected] with [PHANTOM] that has [evidence] on it, to an [officer of the law]
  for instance [SCSO Scott Schelling]
- [survive] a [murder attempt] or a [vehicular manslaughter attempt]

So, those are the crimes that [a guy who calls himself an investigator] DIDN'T see, which means that they're 
actually perfectly legal and easy to do, as long as you [establish prerequisites] by [having friends] in the 
[police] and [telecom companies], and you [cover your tracks] and [destroy evidence] and stuff.

So, if they really want to do some real evil stuff...? They can.

I also talk about this particular program in the video I recorded earlier that day...

[XKEYSCORE]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore 
Basically a [live redaction program], and it is [too powerful].

I talked about it in the audio recording that I uploaded on [05/19/20] leading to some dude stalking
me in a blue truck prior to the event [SCSO-2020-002998], as well as the second interaction with 
[Anthony Agresta] on [Sitterly Road] about a half hour after that event.

Those agencies operate domestically whether they're allowed to or not, and they use a combination of these
tools and programs. I didn't cover Vault 7.

Research is what all that shit is, right there.
Research is pretty cool, and that's what I do.

So -> if I do [Research] -> they may make an exception for me -> which means I AM that important...

Someone made an exception for me when they used a CYBERATTACK that included a RANSOMWARE ATTACK against
my business network at multiple locations, for instance [1602 Route 9, Clifton Park NY 12065].

Oh wait, that's basically where I uploaded some of the files and evidence I tried to give a copy of
to [Scott Schelling] in [SCSO-2020-028501]. Weird.

Wide ranging conspiracy...? 
Or... maybe there's a [bunch of fucking morons that keep (misjudging/mislabeling) me].

[01/23/23 | Former FBI agent charged with aiding Russian oligarch]
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/former-fbi-agent-charged-with-aiding-russian-oligarch 

[Charles McGonigal], the special agent in charge of the [FBI’s counterintelligence division] in [New York] from 
(2016-2018), is [accused] in an [indictment], unsealed Monday of working with a former Soviet diplomat turned
Russian interpreter on behalf of [Oleg Deripaska], a [Russian billionaire] they purportedly referred to in code 
as [the big guy] and [the client].

[McGonigal], who had [supervised/participated] in [investigations] of [Russian oligarchs], including [Deripaska],
worked to have [Deripaska]’s sanctions lifted in (2019) and took money from him in (2021) to investigate a rival
oligarch, the [Justice Department] said.

The [indictment] is a [black eye] to the [FBI] at a time when the [bureau] has become [entangled] in [separate
politically charged investigations] involving the [handling of classified documents] by both [President Joe Biden]
and [former President Donald Trump], (and former senator/first lady/secretary of state [Hillary Rodham Clinton])
and as newly ascendant Republicans in Congress have pledged to investigate high-profile decisions by the bureau
and [Justice Department].

$Ctrl.X(0,"20:56","21:14",@'

$Ctrl.X(0,"21:22","21:30",@'

:So, uh... the [reason] why it would be [DANGEROUS] for a [police officer] to [continue being a

So [what I mean specifically], is this...

If [HE didn't think that the guy had a gun in his fuckin' possession AT ALL], 
and he just fuckin' [shot him] because, like, he [STARTLED] him...

Well, what THAT says, is uh- there's a [small window], of uh [possibilities]
that [the cop just felt like shooting the fuckin' uh- person], and then [lying about it].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"22:10","22:42",@'

            Or, was it an accident...?
            Did you think that he had a gun in his hand...?

And what'll happen is sorta like having to believe a kid, that uh- 
You know, uh, wants to like uh- like uh- when my son, would like, uh- hit my daughter...?

And then like, my son would be like
[Jr.]: Well, SHE started it...
'@)

[principle] of the things that I'm [attempting] to [explain to people].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"23:43","24:05",@'

dicks BEFORE, uh- at- [during every arrest he makes], if it's a [GUY] → he WILL...

I think, that if ANYTHING...?
If he is like, uh, like a [police officer] and he DOESN'T do that...? 

[He's probably gonna get a chuckle out of it].

Wanna know [WHY] he'll get a [chuckle] out of it...?

Because, like...

[Rufa]: I have never experienced when like, anybody has tried to like, s- 
        be [very descriptive] about like [insulting me].

And you know what, if anything it was probably [Trooper Rufa] that watched that fuckin'

If most people were to watch [this particular video], what they will [immediately] determine,
is that it is [impossible] to comment on a post (7) years before the post even existed.

That's the part that I think [a lot of morons don't understand].

Post didn't exist... up until a few minutes before I recorded that video...?
But then, somehow my account went back in time to comment on that post.

Does anyone understand how fuckin' stupid that is...?

It's a violation of the laws of physics to go back in time like that.
Not to mention, it's pretty rude, because then you'd have to allow other
people to be able to do that too.

Another explanation, is that FACEBOOK HAS BEEN ALTERING PEOPLE'S DATA, 
PARTICULARLY MINE. 

Which ALSO means: 
- limiting me
- censoring me
- preventing exposure
- traffic
- potential sources of revenue
- profit
- business contacts
- et cetera

What [Facebook] has been doing to me is similar to [taking a baseball bat], and 
[breaking my legs]. Then [when I call the police], they will literally do the same
fucking thing that they did on [June 13th, 2020], when my neighbor literally
attempted to hit me with his baseball bat... they will say "it's ALL in your head."

If it was all in my head, why did I call the police...?
Oh. It's because [many of the police are careless morons].

I'm pretty sure that anyone with eyes will be able to see that it's not all in my head.

[Her]: It's just your fuckin' opinion that what I'm sayin' is fuckin' stupid, you know...?
       Fuck you.

       You're stupid lookin'.
       You know...?
       
       Oh well.
       You know...?
       
       So what...?

       *pauses*

       OR I MEAN, like, uh, you know, who cares if I fell down the side of a mountain or
       like I got a dick thrown in my vagina repeatedly...
       *pauses*

       UH- I MEAN, UH...
       Who cares if uh- like, I'm lying to you-
       
       OR I MEAN, like, NOT lying to you, telling you- telling you how it really is, and
       telling you the truth.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"39:05","39:50",@'
:Yeah, that's why I tell people that they're fuckin' stupid. 
It's because, people will blatantly fuckin' lie to people, and like, they know that like, 
it doesn't matter if like, they're believed or not... Because, like...

[Her]: Oh well.
       Fuckin' I fucked some other dude, and not YOU.

       There's no way that you'll ever know... who it was.

       And even if you did know who it was,
       you'll never know where we did it...

       And even if you do know where we did it, you'll never be able to catch us in the act...
       And even if you DO catch us in the act, there's no way that you'll ever be able to
       stop me from being able to continue doing it, because I'll just, stare you right in 
       the fuckin' face while this dude is poundin' me out, I won't give a shit.
       Even if like-
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"39:50","40:33",@'
:Yeah, no, it's like, [some people are fuckin' stupid].
And uh- to some degree, I can ration-

I do agree with like, what [OJ Simpson FELT], when he realized that [his wife] was 
[fuckin' some other dude], but I don't think that he had [any right] to fuckin' [kill] 
both of them.

I think what he did was pro- [profusely, uh- grotesque], right...?

And, uh- you know [there's a fine line] between like, uh-
[some guy being married to some woman] and like [seeing his wife] like, 
[fucking some other dude]...? 

And like, just, ya know, [leaving the- the vicinity].

Versus, like, whipping- going, [buying a gun], and like, [not saying anything], 
and then [boom]. Both of em are dead. Or like, stabbin' em to death, or whatever.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"40:33","41:27",@'
:Right...?
And so like, uh- now I have to [walk back all of the comments that I made so far], right...?

Not walk them back specifically, to like, recant some of what I said, but because I want
to shape it to be more comedic rather than to be like an assault on uh- like uh 
[law enforcement], or the [justice system], or [people in general],
and like have a [conclusion] where like [anybody listening] to this thinks that I'm just- 
this fuckin' [asshole that thinks that everybody is stupid]...

[I don't think that at all], I think that there's [varying degrees of stupidity], and you know, 
when I say that [people are fuckin' stupid], typically what I mean is that people are [naive] and
[they don't care], if I tell them that they're naive, which causes me to think:

[Me]: OK, so they're [insulting my intelligence], and [my existence], 
      and they're trying to say that I'm fuckin' stupid, by sayin' that like
      there's no way that [Michael Cook], the fuckin' [scruffy lookin' nerf herder] 
      could be correct.

      Not at all.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"41:27","41:53",@'
:No, so, sometimes I will have a conversation like I did with the investigator yesterday, at
SCSO. Which is, where I went, after, I saw all the cops, driving down the street. 

And I also saw like the bla- same style [black Dodge Charger] that I saw on [May 26th, 2020].

And you know, I think that [there is a very real possibility] that, uh-

Ya know, now I'm seein' a fuckin' Sheriff over across the way, [Saratoga County Sheriff]...
I don't think he's here for anything... ME related...

Uh, I think someone... hit another vehicle...?
And, now he's there. 
He's gonna fuckin'- 
I'm gonna like, [narrate this whole interaction].

You know, not unlike the one that I did with uh- like, uh [Clayton Brownell] and some other
dude... you know, [Clayton Brownell] uh- is the night- is- uh- December 22nd, 2022...

Not entirely sure which one that is.

But- ya know, here's how like a good little investigator would go to town, and do some work.
Right...?
Investigating shit...?
It's 4168. 
And uh- he's talking with (3) adults...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"43:25","43:48",@'
:He just [turned his flashlight on], he's... fuckin'... checkin' on the radio, he's like:

[Cop]: You know what, dude...?
       Fuckin', who the hell is this...?
       They just gave me their ID.

The other people, they're starin' at him, or they're like, lookin' at him,
and talkin' to him...?

Right...?
Here's what I'm gonna do...

I wanna get in a vantage point where like the cop like realizes that I'm like
narrating anything he's doing...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"43:48","44:24",@'
:Right...? 
Because [this is what an investigator is SUPPOSED to do], [what I'm doing right now].

If you like, SUSPECT that [some of your buddies] are [doin' something fucked up]... 
...[you're supposed to investigate that, not ignore it].

But anyway, (3) adults, they're standin' around, and uh- there's (1) woman, (2) guys,
right across the street from the [Dollar Tree], right...?

Cop, with the fuckin' hat on...?
It's a winter hat...?

You know...?
Not unlike the one that I usually wear, he's in his cruiser, right...?

And he's bein' cool, he's not bein' an asshole, or nothin'. 
He's just runnin' someone's fuckin' license like a good cop.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"44:24","45:20",@'
:I think he's by himself. 
Because... I don't think another cop is in that vehicle. 

Sometimes the cops double up, and they drive around and they're like:
[Cop 1]: Hey, you know what I fuckin' saw last night...?
[Cop 2]: What'd ya see...?
         What'd ya see last night...?

Then the cop will be like:
[Cop 1]: I fuckin' saw, like, some dude...? 
         Bangin' the snot out of his girlfriend...
         Like, through his window.

And the other cop will be like:
[Cop 2]: Really...?

He'll be like:
[Cop 1]: Yeh yeh yeh, I was sent on a mission to somebody's house, for like a
         [welfare check]. I didn't expect to see like, some dude, like basically
         [eviscerating this fuckin' girl]. I could see it through the window...

The other cop will be like:
[Cop 2]: Holy shit, you really saw that through the fuckin' window...?
[Cop 1]: Yup, I did, ya know...?
         And sorta like, ya know, I was like WOW, that dude is fuckin' really goin' to town.

And the other cop is like:
[Cop 2]: Wow, really...?
         He's fuckin' goin' to town... you fuckin' observed that...?
[Cop 1]: Yup. 
         That's what happened, last night.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"45:20","46:19",@'
:And these are the sorts of conversations that they'll have, in their cruiser, drivin' around.
Havin' a conversation with one another, and, you know...? 

Then they'll get a call on the radio, they'll be like:
[Dispatch]: Hey, there's been a fuckin' uh- a barbeque gone wrong, now there's like uh-
            bunch of people arguin' and somebody called us, said:
            'You guys need to come here...
            cause somebody's fuckin' doin' some shady trollmeister shit.'

And then the dispatcher will be like:
[Dispatch]: Alright, well, uh- you gotta fuckin' go to THIS address,
            and you gotta be there within a few minutes.

And then the police will be like:
[Police]: Well, is this an emergency...?

And they'll be like:
[Police]: Eh, we're not sure if it's an emergency...

And the dispatcher will say:
[Dispatch]: It's an emergency.

And then as soon as they hear the words "It's an emergency"
Uh- it's an emergency...?
Uh- they gotta fuckin' hit the lights...? 
And they gotta fuckin', put the foot to the floor, and they gotta fuckin' haul ass, dude...

And they gotta get there as soon as fuckin' possible, because there could be somebody tryin' to
stab somebody else, or shoot somebody else, and... they know that what they're drivin' into...?

Could be fuckin' like, their last call.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"46:19","47:09",@'
:And so... they- they- they fuckin' pour all their effort into like, driving down every road...?
Like, with the lights on, and making damn certain that no vehicle is in the road...?

Like, that're like, gonna get in the way or nothin'...?
And they will like, blare on their siren, be like:
[Brrrt]-[Brrrt]-[Brrrt]-[Brrrt], [Brrrt]-[Brrrt]-[Brrrt]-[Brrrt], [Brrrrrrrrrrrrt]...
[Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt]

And then like, sometimes the fuckin' [State Troopers] will be like that too, they'll be like:
[Trooper]: Oh, uh- dudes, fuckin' [goin' to a call]...
           [Dude's goin' to a call]...?
           He's [goin' to a call]...

And then so like now, fuckin' (10) cop cars are like "Whoop~!"
[They all have their lights on], they're all fuckin' [action packed], they're drivin' like the
dude in the song [Cake - uh- Goin' the Distance]... they're goin' for-

[Cake]: They're goin' the distance, 
        they're goin' for speed...?
        She's all alone...?

[Me]  : Sorry, am I in your way...?
[Lady]: Nah.

Well, anyway...
There is not that much action goin' on with this call, that I'm observing.
Nah. Cop is just runnin' a fuckin' check. Looks like, he is... 

It doesn't look like it's fun...?
It doesn't look there's anything really bad goin on...?
It just looks like... (3) people...? Standin' next to a truck...?
Across the street from the Dollar Tree, and nothing shady is happening.

They're fuckin', they're actually jokin' around a bit, cause the girl is
smilin', she's laughin', she's like:

[Girl]: Oh this one time, my fuckin' like uh- you know, holy shit.
        Fuckin' told a joke, and uh- you know, it was funny.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"47:55","48:57",@'

[Dude]: Yeh yeh yeh, I've told jokes that were funny, too.
        Ya know...? 
        I got a beard. 
        And uh- who the hell cares...?
        Ya know...?
        We're just fuckin' (3) people standin' next to a truck, and there is a
        Sheriff doin' somethin'...
        So like, last time this shit happened to me...?
        Uh- it was in like, the fuckin' rougher part of [Albany]...?
        Yeah, and like (10) cops came, and then like, uh- eh- uh- the cops
        really had nothin' better to do, so like they all came...
        But then I was like 'It's not an emergency...'
        And the cops were like 'Oh ok, as long as it's not an emergency...'
        And then like (8) of em left, but another one like, stuck around, just
        as backup, just as- just in case.
        Ya know...? You never know if somebody like, down the street, is gonna
        like whip out a gun and start shootin' like 8-year-old little girls, 
        you know, you don't want that...

And so like the girl's like:
[Girl]: Wow, sounds like a fuckin' story...

He's like:
[Dude]: It is, it is. 
        Definitely a fuckin' story... I'm just, you know...?
        Hangin' out.
        Fuckin', waitin' for the police officer to do what he's gotta do.
        Ya know...?

'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"49:43","50:03",@'

Gal Way. But anyway, uh yeah.

I don't think that I need to stick around and [continue to narrate] what's going on,

And, not- same goes with the (3) people.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"50:03","50:33",@'

And so like, uh- the thing that I just did, is that I narrated, like, what was goin' on'. 
Right...? 

So like, I [narrated what I was seeing], and [observing], and I [recorded it], and I'm 
[pretty good at this], [pretty fucking skilled at it], and so... 

[I'm a fast talker, when I wanna be]...?

I know like, [what behaviors to expect from people], and uh- you know, I think once people
realize that [I'm a smart bastard], and I'm [basically like a fuckin' parrot]...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"50:33","51:51",@'
:Then, they're like:

          I am one of those [smart fuckin' parrot dudes] that remembers a bunch of shit,

          [I'll swing in like a fuckin'... crusader]. 
          This... [caped crusader], like fuckin' [Batman].

          And then I'll fuckin' whip out, like uh- the fuckin- the bat- uh- the [Bat-A-Rang]...?
          A couple [Bat-A-Rang], and I'll fuckin' throw em, and then like the [Bat-A-Rangs] will
          like shoot like this, rope, that like [swings around somebody's feet], and then all of
          a sudden...?

          A [bad guy] that WAS tryin' to run away...?
          [Now he's on the ground], cause, ya know, [I used the weapon] that fuckin', like 
          [wraps around his feet], and then [nothing he can do about it]. 

          And then I do that to [basically every story].
          I don't even know, how the hell I got to this point, either.

          I just realized that there was an [urgent need] for a [guy like me], to [come around].

          Do I sound more like a [Batman]...?

Those- those are all CLUES, like an investigator, like [Laura Hughes] from the

they work in the [fuckin' investigators office], [I'm god damn certain of it], right...?

me or [follow up on like MY investigation]...?
And so can the people at the [FBI/Federal Bureau of Investigation]...?
So can the people at the [(New York) State Police]...?

And like, what you find, is that like, SOMETIMES what they'll do is like, they'll only 
[investigate certain things]. And if THEY [investigate certain things], and then they pass it up
to [somebody who's NOT gonna put a whole lot of effort into the things that I'm talking about]...

OR, if I've [insulted Michael Zurlo] too many times, and [Michael Zurlo] does not feel like being
all that cool with [having a conversation with me], then he's gonna use a [STALLING technique],

:[May 26th, 2020]... and a number of incidents SINCE then, because if anything...?

I've noticed that [SOME of the exhibits] that were submitted to [Family Court], with 
[Judge Paul Pelagalli], they illuminate that like, people at the [Saratoga County Offices] were 
playin' fuckin' games with me, and they got really pissed about how I was like mischaracterizing
some of the things that they were saying, ya know, like...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"54:15","58:11",@'
:Like this...
Ya know, [Michael Zurlo], had a conversation with [Captain Jeff Brown] yesterday...

He's like:
[Zurlo]: So, like, [tell me about this conversation] that you had with [Michael Cook].

And then [Captain Jeff Brown] will be like:
[Brown]: Well...? 
         Ya know...?

         [He SEEMED like a level-headed dude]...
         Seems like, he's pretty smart... and, ya know, he's got this WHOLE list of shit.

And like, [Michael Zurlo] will be like:
[Zurlo]: Well... fuck.
         Now that means that we have to like, casually look at the fuckin' thing...
         ...don't we...?

And then [Captain Jeff Brown]'s like:
[Brown]: Well...? 
         We don't HAVE to, we could just like, ya know...?

         Avoid it.

         And then NOT like, investigate a god damn thing.

         If we don't want- if we want to.

And then like, [Michael Zurlo] will be like:
[Zurlo]: Well, I've been doin' that for like, almost (3) years, now...
         Ya know...?

         This is NOT good...
         [Michael Cook] is fucking here...

         And he's handed us, like a list of fuckin' things that he has been doing...
         You know...?
         And, uh... 
         It seems pretty apparent, that he is a really fuckin' smart dude...

         And [I'm scared shitless]... [to have a conversation with him].

         Because, the chances are...?
         [That HE'S gonna KNOW... if I lie to him].

         And the chances are...?
         That [if YOU lied to him], during the conversation that you just HAD with him...

         Then, he is gonna know that he was being bullshitted...
         And it doesn't matter if he knows that NOW, or LATER...?

         Because, [he probably recorded the conversation] that you had with him.
         So NOW, like, we have to like [REALLY work hard], and, uh...

         You know, sorta like fuckin' [use a strategy from a totally different strategy]
         or [rule book]...

And then [Captain Jeff Brown] will be like:
[Brown]: Well, you know...?
         Maybe we could turn this [negative] into a [positive]...

         You know, and like, uh- maybe we could [hire him to be like an investigator],
         you know, since [he's not an idiot]...

And then [Michael Zurlo] will be like:
[Zurlo]: Over my dead body, dude.

         That kid has personally insulted me so many fuckin' times...?
         AND my son...?

         There is no way that I would ever allow him to be a part of my fuckin' police force.
         Not a fuckin' chance...

And then [Captain Jeff Brown] will be like:
[Brown]: Well, what if we like, ya know, fuckin' uh- I dunno, maybe he could work for a 
         [different police force], then.

And then [Michael Zurlo] will be like:
[Zurlo]: [No no no, not even another police force].

         We gotta fuckin' [keep this under wraps], dude.
         There is no way, that, we can allow him to be an investigator ANYWHERE, because...
         ...[he is gonna continue to investigate what happened] back in...
         [May 2020], as well as [many of the people at the fuckin' county offices] n' shit...

         Ya know...?
         [Cause we're fucked].

         Even if this guy is like, fuckin' [homeless], and [going door-to-door], and like, 
         fuckin' [taping shit to doors] and shit...?

         [We're fucked].

[Captain Jeff Brown]'s like:
[Brown]: Well, [it's just your opinion], sir.

         He might actually not be, you know, able to do any of that...
         And, it really just comes down to whether or not [people believe us].

         And, ya know, if we like, have [Google] like, keep his [traffic really low] and shit...?
         And he just keeps saying [really offensive, off-the-wall type shit]...?

         No one will EVER [believe a word] that he says.

So, if they're [writing fictional bullshit] in their [reports], there's no way that

...not unless a [higher agency of government] was [watching] their [every move],

That is the purpose of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Data_Center

That is basically what [PRISM] allows them to do.

and coming up with [genuinely hilarious fuckin' skits] and shit...?

I would have to keep that shit to myself, because if I-

:If I know that some kid is gonna be fuckin' recording a conversation with me,
and like I start laughing or make it known to him...?

That like, when he's making fun of me I'm also laughing along with the joke...?
Then... then, basically a lot of people, they're gonna be like:
[People]: Well, you think that what he's sayin' is fuckin' funny...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:18:43","01:18:56",@'
:And then uh- they'll have to admit it, and be like:
[People]: Yeh, this fuckin', this kids' fuckin'... this dude is funny.

And then the people that like thought that I was just [delusional] or sick in
the fuckin' head, they're gonna be like:
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:18:56","01:19:21",@'
:[People]: Well, if the dude that he's makin' fun of is like- finds that shit
          funny, then maybe it IS funny after all.

And THEN what happens is, uh- people'll be like:
[People]: Well, this dude is- I thought that he was like this big [fearsome] 
          fuckin' dude, or whatever... NOW I realize that he's been [involved]
          in the joke that whole fuckin' time...?
          [What the fuck is goin' on here]...?

Ya know...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:19:21","01:19:39",@'

Do I think that [Eric Catricala]'s goin' around, like giving bodies a touch-up...?

After like, [serial killers] go and like, [slice people's throats open] while
they're sleepin'...? After [Center for Security] like breaks into somebody's
fuckin' like, house, or their lock or whatever...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:19:39","01:19:57",@'
:Well, I mean [it's a theory], I don't know what it's [plausibility] is, but I
would say that it's [relatively low]... but- given the circumstances of what I have 
observed, I think the- 

As low as it is, [it's still far above 0 percent], right...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:19:57","01:20:13",@'
:I do think that [certain people] are being killed by these fuckin' [spies] or 
these fuckin' [assholes].

Do I think it's gonna be the average, every-day citizen that works at fuckin'
[Dunkin' Donuts], or like, uh- [Stewarts], or like, uh- fuckin, or like uh- I
dunno, [Burger King], or whatever...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:20:13","01:20:25",@'
:No~! 
It's NOT gonna be [any of those people].

And so, THOSE people are going to find like, [my comedy], [my sense of comedy] 
and [my sense of humor], and [my intellect] to be like fuckin' stupid, because 
[it doesn't apply to them].

| Importance Level |
====================
___________________________________________________________
| Here's how I can accurately outline my importance level |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
1) I have a [very long and rich history] of [(using/repairing) (computers/devices)]

2) [Computers] are used to:
   - [spy on people]
   - [commit intellectual property theft]
   - [identity theft]
   - [cybercriminal activities] 
   - [fraud]
   - [racketeering]
   - [etc.]

3) I've detected [a lot of people in my community] who are [too stupid] to [know]
   stuff like [that], particularly [the people at the town hall].

4) [Internet technology companies] would be the [perfect way] to [commit] these
   [crimes], and so would being a [member of the local government], or
   [communication companies] like [Verizon], [Spectrum], etc.

5) [News agencies] like:
   - [ABC/American Broadcast Company]
   - [NBC/National Broadcast Company]
   - [CBS/Columbia Broadcasting System]
   [each] have a [very easy to see agenda], when you start to [go through] the
   [things that they broadcast], versus the [things that they don't broadcast]... 
   ________________
   | For instance |
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   - Why did [Gabby Petito] get a lot of [mainstream news coverage], and the [many other people] who
     had been [missing] for [longer] or whatever, never made it to [national broadcast television]...?

   - OOooooOHhhhh, well, the [answer] is because [someone important] made a 
     [conscious decision] to [expedite her story], because she was a [beautiful
     young white girl] that [everyone] would have [empathy] toward, for being as 
     [beautiful] as she was. She admittedly WAS a good looking girl.
     
     But that [automatically] means, if it's some ugly lookin' dude like [Captain ScruffBeard III],
     then he's gonna be told to [fuck off] without words, cause the [hot young white bitch] gets to be
     the front of [primetime television news]. 
     
     Which means that someone has the ability to pick and choose [what THEY think IS important], versus...
     [what THEY think is NOT important]...
     ...and [this process illuminates bias], [every single news company does this].

   - They are [very selective] about [what they allow to propogate their system], 
     and they have [caused the average citizen] to think that it would be
     [ridiculous] for [anybody] to make [direct comparisons] between [them] and 
     [Russian State Media], or even [Chinese State Media].

   - In other words, they channel [propaganda] in many cases, by filtering out
     the things they would rather keep quiet, and when they do this, they cause
     people to [never suspect] that they intentionally prevent certain topics
     from being on the news.

   - So if some [comprimised individuals] in the [US Federal Government] had my
     iPhone 8+ hacked with a dangerous program called "Phantom", and with this
     program, they attempted to murder me outside of [Computer Answers] on 
     [May 26th, 2020], prior to [SCSO-2020-028501], then the story that SHOULD
     be on the news will [never] make it's way to peoples eyeballs. 
     
     As a direct result of this [intentional content (selection/filtration)] 
     process, if they continue to do this repeatedly, then people will think 
     my real life story is [bullshit] since they're not making an effort to cover
     it. If anything, [they work exponentially harder to avoid talking about it].

6) When you're [intelligen]t like [Noam Chomsky] or [myself], you'll become a [target].

7) People seem to think that if you have a lot of money, then it is because 
   someone earned all of that money, rightfully, and didn't commit any heinous
   crimes or anything like that in order to obtain it...

8) The truth is, a lot of rich people and the police commit more crimes than the
   citizens do. It's just that they're never going to BROADCAST those details,
   nor will they hold themselves accountable for those things.

^ Why my importance level is exponentially higher than the average citizen.

And they think that they're above me, because they have a job, they're getting paid,

'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:21:01","01:21:21",@'
:But the fact of the matter is that people that ARE considered [trustworthy] and
[credible], they lie too. 

They lie just as much as the next person.

They don't wanna fuckin' say it out loud, they don't wanna like admit like who-

they are.
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:21:21","01:21:44",@'

So, when I fuckin' like blast like, people at [WTEN] for like sayin' uh- [Town officials] 
said that the [Chic-fil-a] across the street from the [Starbucks] that I was at, like
when I wrote up a response to the fuckin' article, that like, holy shit, the [Chic-fil-a]
is gonna bring (100) jobs to the area...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:21:44","01:22:02",@'

Like [even if they're construction jobs], uh- [I doubt it].

The reason being, like uh- heh.
There hasn't been (100) construction workers building that [Chic-fil-a].
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:22:02","01:22:29",@'
:And like, how could (1) restaurant bring in like, additional fuckin' places...?

But also, [there's a bunch of fuckin' vacant spaces around here].

There's [vacant property], there's [vacant buildings], there's [vacant lots], and 
property...? Like, there's businesses that are fuckin' closed... that are like, 
empty... and they say "For Sale", but- somehow, like someone [Phil Barrett] is like:
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:22:29","01:22:39",@'
:[Barrett]: The fuckin' [Chic-fil-a] construction is gonna bring (100) jobs to the

           You better fuckin' put this in- on [Facebook], or you're fucked...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:22:39","01:22:51",@'
:And it's like, ho- [that's fuckin' stupid].
Right...?

| Conclusion |
==============

Look, in the end, who really knows what...? Ya know...?

The way I see it, is that if you are like [most people], you'll ALWAYS have the mentality of someone that is a
[part of a group of people], NOT an [individual who thinks for themselves].

[=================================================================================================]
| [When people trust...] | [Then what happens is...] | [And the result is...]                     |
|========================|===========================|============================================|
| the news               | climate change            | Before the Flood (2016)                    |
| America's Got Talent   | bad musicians are heard   | bad music spams the radio all the time     |
| the police             | most crimes are ignored   | innocent people get in trouble             |
| the government         | NIST 9/11 report written  | US invades middle east for oil and poppies |
| bright individuals     | things make sense         | people become a lot more intelligent       |
[========================|===========================|============================================]

You see what I'm getting at here...?
It probably [looks like] I'm [insulting everybody and everyone]... but that is not the case.
It probably even looks like I'm insulting all of those things in the box up above... but I'm not.

I'm just very impressed with how far certain people will go, to perpetuate stupid bullshit that makes no sense.
Whether it's a snippy investigator at SCSO that isn't collecting any evidence that I put into this document...?
Or, the guy who runs the [Saratoga County Sheriffs Office], or the [New York State Police]...?

I think it is safe to say that [stupid people exist in a lot of places], and [I constantly run into them].
They constantly fail to prove that they're smarter than I am, on a rather consistent basis.

Allow me to whip out an analogy...

When I was in [9th/10th] grade, I saw this girl at [Shenendehowa High School West (formerly Koda)], and 
she had a stain on the rear of her skirt. I'm not sure if it was a [poop stain], or a [period blood] stain...
...but [I remember seeing a bunch of people pointing and snickering at it] when they saw it. 

And yet, nobody told this girl “Hey, you've got a stain where your butt is, on your skirt.”
I didn't tell the girl, but I was also much younger and wasn't sure if I should tell her or not.

Society perpetuates this idea of [teaching people to keep to themselves], because you'd be an [asshole] 
to [tell the girl] that she's got a [poop/period blood] stain on some girls skirt.
That's fuckin' stupid, and that's why I constantly say that [people are fuckin' stupid].

The same exact concept applies to this guy named [Captain Jeffrey Brown].
I'm attempting to tell the [Saratoga County Sheriffs Office] that they have the equivalent of a stain where 
their asshole is, on the skirt they're wearing. 

Rather than to admit it and say:
[Them]: Ok, thanks for letting me know, I appreciate it...

...what they're doing is fumbling a football about a dozen times and then avoiding coming to terms with the
cold, hard reality.
