:Saturday, February 18th, 2023, Michael Cook speaking. It's currently, 5:56pm...?

I'm making this audio log to talk about terms that are rather offensive, which I sort of capitalized
on earlier today, uhm- however, I'd like to expand upon that because...
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:20",@'
:I know that uh- some of my language is uh- it OFFENDS certain people, right...?
Or maybe my language will offend EVERYBODY, right...?
And then, I have to rewind to like an audio recording that I made uh- a few months ago,
sorta like uh, observing and analyzing some uh- of uh George Carlin's
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:41",@'
:Uh- rhetoric, right...?
Regard-, uh- especially regarding the, his skit from like the- sometime in the 70's,
regarding the 7 words that you'll never hear on the fuckin' TV.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:57",@'
:Right so, already right there, I'm already whippin' out the F word.
So I'm sorta like, bein' a trollmeister 5000 already. 
But I'm not being a REAL trollmeister... not at all.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:12",@'
:Nah, I think the problem is that, I'm being limited by people that are fuckin' 
stupid, and they ha- the reason why they're doing it is because they're jealous
of how fuckin' intelligent I am, and they will use every fucking trick or, uh- 
trick in the book, to try to limit me...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:32",@'
:And then make, uh- OTHER people's perceptions of what I say or do...
to seem so OFFENSIVE, that like, I should practically be in a prison or a jail 
cell, for the amount of foul ass fuckin' things that I say.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:50",@'
:Right...? So what I'm doing, is I'm exhibiting a sense of being more sophisticated
than a lot of people, who like follow the rules, and got to where they we- where 
they are in society, by doing what they were told, and being a good little boy or
girl, that ya know, followed instructions...
'@)

$File.X(0,"02:08",@'
:Right...? I can convey a sense of being just as sophisticated as uh- Rex Smith 
over at the Times Union, or any of the uh the journalists that work at the Times 
Union, or the Gazette, or the Saratogian, or like the New York Post, or WTEN or
WRGB, or WNYT, right...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"02:31",@'
:I exhibit a sense of uh- being extremely sophisticated when I talk, right...?
And then when like, I capitalize on something offensive and it goes against the
conventional mold of society, I think what happens is that somebody, that's been
trying to contain me, wants to make it so that- I- I give up on myself, or uh- 
other people, THEY give up on like, uh, reading or absorbing my content or 
whatever I have to say or produce.
'@)

$File.X(0,"03:01",@'
:Right...? And this typically happens when I insult certain highly respected
people, right...? And then like, I'll notice like, uhm, some of these signs
that I have hit the nail right on the fuckin' head... when, some of the 
numbers that I'm seeing...? They're being skewed, right...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"03:20",@'
:So like if I- lets- let me put it into perspective. 
So if I send a text message to this- some girl, that like, always wants to
have sex- have sex with me, right...? Right...?

And uh- had sex with her for many many weeks, every single time we started
messaging, she's like 'Hey, wanna have sex...?' ...right...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"03:39",@'
:So like if I establish that as a baseline, and I know that if I text some
girl about havin' sex with her...? She's gonna text me back in a few minutes
to like an hour, she might be bus- like, lets say on the worst occasion, 
she might be so busy that she doesn't get back to me within like an hour
or two... right...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"03:59",@'
:So, if I establish that as a baseline...?
And then like, something fuckin' happens, or like, I say something that
really upsets her, or whatever...? And then I like, try to use the same
tactics...? Even more...? And like, she starts to come up with excuses 
like "Oh, I uh- fell asleep..." or "Oh, um... I was- I was going like, 
grocery shopping with my mom, and I left my phone at my other house...
I just got back, is- I know it's been like 3 days, but you know, um..."
'@)

$File.X(0,"04:35",@'
:SO, what I'm doing right there, is I'm illuminating there's a reason WHY someone would be-
would say misleading things to me. Or, wouldn't be reporting the same sort of uh- events.

Or, I might like- ok.
'@)

$File.X(0,"04:51",@'
:So, allow me to apply this to a, everyone else. Right...? 
Everybody else...? They think like on a, what-happens-today...and-that's-it basis...

They dont' really think about like, things in their future, unless they're planning for
something like they're goin' to school or whatever...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"05:09",@'
:They don't really think a lot about their past, unless they're thinking about like,
what they want to achieve in life, or what they decided to be when they started going
to school, or, or whatever...? Right...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"05:20",@'
:So our society unwittingly trains people to throw out the idea of uh- remembering
things, and uh- being sophisticated, and uh- society uses a range of tactics to try
to like exude dominance or control or whatever, right...? So like um...
'@)

$File.X(0,"05:43",@'
:I've been uh- consistently uploading videos over the last, you know, couple of weeks,
every day, maybe (1) video or multiple...? Not all of the videos have gotten attention, 
or like uh- whatever...? But um, I've seen a consistent effort from like somebody working
at either Google, or somewhere in between, me and Google, like, seeing the content that
I'm like, uploading...? And then responding to it, and like saying:
"Yeh, that's cool. Your content's cool or whatever..."
Right...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"06:14",@'
:So what this causes me, to believe, is that it's ALWAYS a factor.

And uh- if you start out doing something that upsets people at Google, then basically
it's like uh- it's basically like uh- putting yourself in a box, and you're a plant, 
and uh- ya know the maximum shape that you weill ever grow as that plant, is the 
size of that box. You'll never be able to outgrow the box.

You'll always be confined within the box, because, you know, somebody made damn
certain that like your maximum shape would be the size of that box, and therefore, 
that allows you to only, like uh- to influence a certain number of people.
'@)

$File.X(0,"07:02",@'
:And so like, if you try to tell people 
"Yeah, I could be WAY cooler than this fuckin' box that I'm in... and I'll talk
about how fuckin' cool I am...?" And then like uh- you try to like impress other
people, or like, go outside of the box...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"07:15",@'
:What happens is like people will be like
"Well, why the fuck isn't this dude on like uh- like uhm, like HBO doing stand up
specials or some shit...?" Cause what he's sayin' is genuinely funny, but like
what'll happen is like some people will be like 
"Well if he was that funny, then why aren't people reacting to some of the shit
that he's saying..?" Right...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"07:36",@'
:And then what I'll say is that I've been being censored on Facebook by the owner
of Facebook, like at an aggressive rate, and it's so aggressive that like when I 
mention him in some of the videos that I make..? Uh, what happens is like, there'll
be like zero views, or somethin' like that.
'@)

$File.X(0,"07:56",@'
:It'd basically be like "What the fuck...? A ghost town..."
And like, ya know, this uh- its so fuckin' uhhhh, obvious that like, something
I'm doing is pissin' off somebody with a lot of money, and it could be multiple
people that I'm pissin' off, th- they all have a lot of money.
'@)

$File.X(0,"08:12",@'
:And they don't like when I talk about them, because I think that some of them are
fuckin' jealous as to how intelligent I am, and they didn't get to be where they
are by like, allowing people like me, to have free reign, like, normal every-day
citizens do, and what this causes is like uh- me to think of ways to like uh- 
derive who would have those intentions, and then like, uh- what you come to find
is like, uh- there might be an evil trollmeister that is tryin' to like, uh- 
keep me as quiet as possible...
'@)

$File.X(0,"08:51",@'
:So that I cannot influence additional people, nor get myself out of the position
that I'm in, because, the public opinion of me, has been consider- considerably
reduced because of a number of fucking morons marring my character, and therefore...
'@)

$File.X(0,"09:07",@'
:What this ALSO causes, is like sometimes I will say something that's genuinely funny,
and I'll reference something that's genuinely funny, and I'll post it on Facebook
or like social media, and then someone will come along, and then remotely connect
to my device, it'll cause the icons on my desktop to flash, so then I have to start
talking about how I went to a bunch of places, yesterday, and then distributed a
document, in the document I talk about like uh-
'@)

$File.X(0,"09:38",@'
:All of the work that I've been doing the last couple of months, I can guarantee
that most people aren't gonna like, consume all of that content, but what I CAN say,
is that I know for a god damn fact, that when I stopped at the Saratoga County
Sheriffs Office Administrative Office...
'@)

$File.X(0,"09:55",@'
:And then I said "Hey I'd like to speak to Michael Zurlo, the county Sheriff..."
Then what happened was...

more to the story behind my FATHER'S MURDER] as well as [another cab driver] that was [ALSO
murdered] at or about that time.

Uh, [Honorable Justice Francine Vero] was a [key witness] in the trial for the SECOND cab driver

$File.X(0,"07:18",@'

:Well, basically, she showed up and uh, unbeknownst to me, my mother had already made a
statement to [Sara DeRusso], of the [State Police], right...?

And uhm, unbeknownst to THEM, [they never corroborated MY side of the story]. 
And as soon as I told them that I had an [AUDIO RECORDING that I UPLOADED, PRIOR to HER
making the 911 call]... 

Uh, it- I went through and I transcribed the audio recording, I tried to give it to my
public defender (former JC Davis, current Michael Depresso), and like... the COURT is
doing a really fine, swell job of kinda like, pretending that doesn't exist. 

And that like, I'm... guilty.
'@)

$File.X(1,"07:57",@'
:So, is that case still open...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"07:58",@'
:Yes.
'@)

$File.X(1,"07:58",@'
:And, you have this audio recording...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"08:00",@'
:Yes.
'@)

$File.X(1,"08:01",@'
:Ok.
'@)

$File.X(0,"08:02",@'
:So like, uhm... on that list right there...?
'@)

$File.X(1,"08:04",@'
:Uh-huh.
'@)

$File.X(0,"08:04",@'
:Let me indicate which one to you, uh- uhm... 'statement' right there.
So, on THAT one right there, THAT has the links to it. I have uh- there's (3)
different versions of the sound file, the original one, it was very hard to
hear, and its a (16h) recording.

I edited it because, basically when I say that I'm an orator, I walk around and 
I recorded myself uh-
'@)

$File.X(1,"08:34",@'
:How do I spell that, 'orator'...? How do I spell that...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"08:36",@'
:O-R-A-T, basically it's on the front 'ORATOR'. *pauses* Oration. Expert at oration.
'@)

$File.X(1,"08:47",@'
:I see that.
'@)

$File.X(0,"08:48",@'
:So, orator is basically someone who's a professor. 
Or maybe not necessarily a professor, but somebody that speaks out loud, or like
practices public speaking.
'@)

$File.X(1,"08:55",@'
:Ok.
'@)

$File.X(0,"08:55",@'

'@)

$File.X(1,"08:59",@'

'@)

$File.X(1,"09:01",@'
:Yea.
'@)

$File.X(0,"09:01",@'
:So, I practice this, I listen to myself speak, I listen to my recordings.

I try to talk about things that are bothering me, things in the past. 
I make I make a very uh, big effort to like, be considerate to not cross the red lines, 
or red flag area, but- yeh. [Basically, I talk about everything that I think of].
'@)

$File.X(1,"09:21",@'

'@)

$File.X(0,"09:22",@'

'@)

$File.X(1,"09:25",@'

'@)

$File.X(0,"09:26",@'

There's a lot of information on there.
'@)

$File.X(1,"09:32",@'
:Yeah. Yeah. And you want this delivered to [Sheriff Zurlo]...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"09:34",@'
:Uhm, it'd be NICE, heh. To be perfectly clear, I think that he has been payin' 
attention to me on either [Facebook], or [through the community], and he had his son
[Paul Zurlo] come to my house multiple times 
(one of those times was with the guy who tased me on 06/28/22)... 
and rather than for me to make that [speculation] or [assumption], I wrote a bunch
of documents...? I haven't had a conversation with him yet.

If I have a conversation with him and I like what I hear, and I believe him...
Then those documents, they're gonna need- they're gonna be rewritten.
'@)

$File.X(1,"10:05",@'
:Ok, *turns page* fair enough.
'@)

$File.X(0,"10:08",@'
:So, uhm...
'@)

$File.X(1,"10:10",@'
:Thank you.
'@)

$File.X(0,"10:10",@'
:And, uh- some of the documents I've written, I have an audio recording of me
speaking with uh (you), (not) captain [Tim Brown].
'@)

$File.X(1,"10:19",@'
:Ok.
'@)

$File.X(0,"10:20",@'
:He gave me the record that I needed... 
*pauses* 
You know what, I'll wait till you digest some of this information.
'@)

$File.X(1,"10:26",@'
:Yeah.
'@)

$File.X(0,"10:26",@'

:-You don't even have a way to look through your own records to find a record that 
should exist...?
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:14",@'
:Ya know, in a case report written, otherwise I WOULD be able to find it.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:17",@'
:But no, [Sergeant Welch] told me that there was a call for service, so there SHOULD
be a record of that.

And, the record that [Sergeant Welch] gave me, is for a totally different date. And
that date is [May 23rd] when [Scott Schelling] originally responded to the incident
at [Stratton].

It's NOT related to the (3) sheriffs that were involved at, the [Zappone] dealership,
or at least in front of it. 
On [Route 9]. 
On [May 26th], at approximately [1AM]. 

There should be a [record] of that and I should, I should be able to contact the records
department, and be able to find that interaction that may not have my name on it. There
is a record of that interaction because [Sergeant Welch] told me that it exists. So...
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:01:00",@'
:Well, did you write the number down, if you have the number I can look it up.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:01:04",@'
:What I'm telling you is that the number that he gave me, was for the [WRONG INCIDENT].
So HE doesn't know what it is.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:01:11",@'
:I don't either...
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:01:13",@'

Some things get logged, and some things don't...?
So like, when someone calls- 
'@)

:Every interaction, no...
Again we handle [a hundred thousand complaints a year]...
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:01:25",@'

'@)

$File.X(1,"00:01:30",@'

your name when you called...?
'@)


$File.X(0,"00:01:36",@'
:What I find [perplexing] about this, is that I can tell you that this record should
exist, and you're gonna tell me that the police officer went to that place to check
the surveillance footage, but there's NO RECORD of that.

That's what you're telling me.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:01:50",@'
:No, the one that I read you, is from [5/24] (it was reported on [5/27], not [5/24]).
Well, [5/24] was the funeral home, okay...? Let's see...

Uh, THAT was not the one, let me find the one where he checked the video.
I gotta find the right one, again, I have (8) of them open.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:02:04",@'
:Right.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:02:05",@'

$File.X(0,"00:02:22",@'
:You talkin' about [20-003173], is that what you're talkin' about...? (I meant 003177)

$File.X(1,"00:02:28",@'
:That's the one I'm talkin' about.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:02:29",@'
:Yeah, that's not [Center for Security], totally different address, bud.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:02:35",@'
:Ok, well... again, it- it- it- it's kinda hard to... you seem to think there's some
[wide-ranging conspiracy] involving [my department].
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:02:42",@'
:Well, no, it's not a [wide-ranging conspiracy], I should be able to ask somebody at
your records department or YOU, for the record that should exist for a call for
service where (3) [Saratoga County Sheriff Officers] were in front of the [Zappone]
dealership, on [May 26th]
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:02:56",@'
:Right.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:02:56",@'
:...at approximately [1AM], and all I'm getting so far from you, is a heck of a lot
of redirection, and uh- we have too much to do, and this that and the other thing,
and making up excuses.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:03:06",@'
:Ha ha ha, birds.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:03:09",@'
:What YOU'RE telling me, the Sarato- that officer, [Scott Schelling], went to that
place, after I told him, on [May 26th], that there should be surveillance footage
of me initializing a call to (911) services. 

What you're telling me is that they went to that place, and already checked that
surveillance footage, and it didn't exist.

But- you're telling me that it was the WRONG ADDRESS that they did that.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:03:33",@'
:Boy, you're in an awful lot of em.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:03:34",@'

me clear instructions or directions, or...

I'm asking you specific questions related to this ticket that should exist, and you're
not able to answer it. You're, you're... redirecting.
'@)

'@)

$File.X(1,"00:04:31",@'

'@)

$File.X(1,"00:04:42",@'
:First one was a (911) call, cellular (911), open line, no voice contact.
That's the extent of what I know about that one, lets close that one out.
Second one...

'@)

$File.X(0,"00:04:56",@'
:What time did that call come in...?
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:04:58",@'
:Uhm, let me go back.
Closed that one out.
I have to do this again.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:05:17",@'
:*sigh* Uh, lets see if I can get a location, let's see.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:05:17",@'
:Ah, it's in the... [Plant Road] area, which is not THAT far down the road...
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:05:35",@'
:Yeah, I don't think that- that's related...
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:05:38",@'
:It may not be...

Uhm, no voice contact, and they did attempt to recall, no answer on recall.
Let's see this next one.

Same area...?

'@)

$File.X(1,"00:05:58",@'
:[Burglar alarm], code enforcement, water problem at a business.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:06:08",@'
:Ah, let's see.
This is somebody reporting a... [verbal dispute], it does have a name associated
with it, not your name, and this is not in that particular area, of the county...
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:06:27",@'
:The next one is for power lines down.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:06:34",@'
:The next one is, let's see...
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:06:43",@'
:Well, I can-
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:06:44",@'
:Hold on, I'm goin' through every one of em...
Uh, a power failure alarm, at a business, that's not it...
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:06:54",@'
:Was that [Key Bank]...?
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:06:56",@'
:Nope. Uh, let's see...
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:07:03",@'
:Cause I remember on that night, that uh-
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:07:06",@'
:Hang on for one sec, I got another call comin' in...
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:07:07",@'
:Ok.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:08:10",@'
:Alright, I'm back. So, let me look at this last one, here.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:08:14",@'
:Ok.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:08:16",@'
:Uh~! This is a male out in front of [Zappones]~!
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:08:19",@'
:That's it~!
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:08:19",@'
:[White male], [blue flannel shirt], [brown hair], jumped in front of the callers vehicle as
they passed the location... ...[they're alleging you jumped in front of their car].
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:08:31",@'
:What is that ticket number...?
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:08:34",@'
:It is, [2020-028501]. [1:28] in the morning, you were not the caller, it looks like THEY
were the caller, because you jumped in front of their car.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:08:53",@'
:Right, so uh (sarcasm), for a period of about, you said that was at [1:28]...?
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:09:02",@'
:It looks like they called this in, uh yeah, at [1:28] in the morning.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:09:09",@'
:Ok, so... From...

I have a screenshot that says that I originally tried to call (911) at [12:05].
Now, I can prove that.

'@)

$File.X(1,"00:09:20",@'
:I- I- I- didn't search back that far.
I can search back that far...
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:09:23",@'
:I'm just trying to give you a trajectory of what happened that night.
That way, if you are able to help me, maybe with YOUR experience...
...you'll be able to identify how you can do that.

'@)

$File.X(1,"00:09:34",@'
:Call (911), there's nothing I can do.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:09:36",@'
:Well, what I'm trying to say here, is that I'm giving you my recollection of that night.

The- the attack BEGAN, on [May 25th], and went INTO [May 26th], because it occurred at
approximately [11:30], I uploaded some files from the [Clifton Park Computer Answers]
network, because I used to manage it.

After I uploaded those files, a [couple of (gay looking) kids wearing glasses], [both
wearing hats], uhm, [approximately 6 feet tall], they were [walking on opposite sides
of the street] by the way, but it was rather late so it seemed strange that anybody was
out walking at all. (They both appeared to be sausage wreckers, not unlike Andy Cuomo)

Now, I had a short conversation with one of these kids, uh- and I said
'Hey, are you from around here...?' and he said,
'No, I AM from around here, but I moved away, and then I moved back.'

I was like 'Oh, ok.' and he walks on, and as he's walking on I type something into
my cell phone screen, and whatever I typed into my cell phone screen caused this kid
to STOP, dead in his tracks, when he looked at HIS cell phone, several feet away
(in front of the Catricala Funeral Home).

Maybe (50) feet away, maybe (100) feet.

Now, it could be coincidental (nah it wasn't, he tried to hit me when I was recording
the last audio recording I uploaded prior to the foot chase attack) that he just
happened to look at his phone at a certain time, and he just stopped dead in his
tracks, and it looked like he saw bad news. That's what MY impression was.

At any rate, a couple other things happened, uh- there was a kid at the laundromat
that night, pretty sure that place had surveillance footage but uh- there was a kid
in a black dodge, at that gas station, that was leaving.

'@)

$File.X(1,"00:11:17",@'
:That happened... (6) months ago, I don't know a single business that keeps their footage-
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:11:22",@'
:I'm sure they don't, but- ya know, these are things that I had been attempting to inform
SOMEBODY in your department...
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:11:28",@'
:The only crime I'm seeing here, is [disorderly conduct] for [obstructing a public roadway].
Committed by you.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:11:36",@'
:Because I called (911), and those calls weren't making it to the dispatch station.
So I was trying to get help SOMEHOW. Which led to me like, cutting this phone line
to this house that I suspect...
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:11:49",@'
:If you're not gonna answer me, I'm gonna hang up the phone.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:11:50",@'
:Ok...?
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:11:52",@'
:What would you like me to do, about a (911) call that never made it to my dispatchers...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:11:57",@'
:Well, I'm not trying to have anything done about the (911) call, but what I AM trying
to do...
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:12:03",@'
:There's nothing I can do about that.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:12:04",@'
:But you're saying that-
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:12:06",@'
:It happens all the time because of bad cell coverage.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:12:08",@'
:Right, I- I-
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:12:09",@'
:You ever been in the northern part of the county here...?
Cell coverage is terrible.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:12:12",@'
:It shouldn't happen, here in [Clifton Park], where there's (3) cell towers within a mile.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:12:18",@'
:There are, but again, if there's a problem with- with- [Verizon], or [Sprint], or
[AT&T]'s tower, what could I potentially even- even if you wanted to reach for the
stars, what could I possibly do about that...?

What, climb up there, and make sure all the wires are plugged in...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:12:31",@'
:No, um- what I'm suggesting is that, you're saying that someone checked the
surveillance footage, right...? At the place that I, ya know, left the footage of
me trying to dial (911)...?

You're sayin' that that exists, but you're getting reports mixed up.

'@)

$File.X(1,"00:12:48",@'
:I'm saying, I'm saying he LOOKED at it, I didn't say he downloaded and uploaded it
to our system, I'm saying he viewed it.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:12:53",@'
:Right. But he didn't look at the surveillance footage at [Center for Security].
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:12:58",@'
:Not as far as I can tell...
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:13:00",@'
:Right, but that's where the footage would be of me intializing a (911) call-
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:13:04",@'
:I closed those (8) tabs, to open these (6) new ones, uhm, I thought that was the
[Center]- *indiscernable* that he looked at-
'@)

$File.X(2,"00:13:12",@'
:*Windows Toast Notification*
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:13:13",@'
:-the one where you went into the business and were pestering the guy, trying to look
at his surveillance footage. I think he changed it down the road, that's what it
sounded like to me.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:13:22",@'
:That...
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:13:22",@'
:That is the case that the deputy says he viewed the footage, saw you wandering
around the business, looking at a garage with a flashlight, and holding SOMETHING
in your hand, unable to tell from the quality of the video, whether it was even a
cell phone, or not.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:13:36",@'
:Ok.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:13:36",@'
:Hold on, *indiscernable* situations like that, the quality of the video was not good
enough to tell.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:13:43",@'
:So, something drew me to that area (noises behind the plaza), and they can see the
surveillance footage of me walking around that night.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:13:49",@'
:Ok.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:13:50",@'
:But they can't see the surveillance footage is not from the 24th, that's the problem.
Is that, I didn't walk around [Eric Catricala]'s business on the 24th, I walked around
[Eric Catricala]'s business on the LATE 25th INTO the 26th, and it's being passed off
as security footage that was on the 24th.
That's what's happening here.
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:14:08",@'
:You go back there, you're gonna get locked up for trespassing.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:14:12",@'
:I'm not gonna go back there, but what I'm trying to say is that HEY, maybe I can just,
you know, uh- SAY that recorded footage from (1) date, was on an entirely DIFFERENT
date, and then have some charges filed against somebody.

Which is what's happening to me.

Which is why I have so many incidents with the [Saratoga County Sheriffs Office] AND
the [New York State Police], SINCE [May 26th, 2020]. Is because, somebody's doing that~!

And, I can tell ya till I'm blue in the face, but you're gonna say:
'Look, guy checked the surveillance footage of the WRONG PLACE.'

I'm making an educated decision based on the facts as they are known.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:17:17",@'
:As they are known, yes, some of those facts being incorrect facts.
Being known.
Like, my [neighbor swinging a baseball bat at me], and [Mark Sheehan] not writing that
in his report. I called (911) that day, on [June 12th], or [June 13th] by the way.

'@)

$File.X(1,"00:17:32",@'
:And they had a different story than YOU, and YOU were the one...
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:17:37",@'
:Yeah no, that's whats happening, is that a lot of these police officers are writing
totally fabricated reports.

And that's why when I call a guy like YOU, and ask for corroboration or assistance,
you give me a hard time, saying that I'm the troublemaker, and that I've been arrested
for this, that, and the other thing... but you're not listening to the key critical
thing here, where I initialized a call-
'@)

$File.X(1,"00:17:55",@'

That's ALL I'm listening to.
Okay...?
That's all it is.
'@)

$File.X(0,"00:18:02",@'
:[Scott Schelling] should've gone and [checked that surveillance footage], because he
tried to arrest me that night. He tried to arrest me for jumping in front of a car,

'@)

$File.X(1,"00:18:14",@'
:If he did arrest you, this would be a lot easier, because I wouldn't be able to talk

$File.X(0,"40:35",@'
...they sent out a couple of dudes, the- I don't know what the OTHER dude's name was,
but the dude that came out and talked with me...? He seemed to be a rather professional
sounding dude...? And, uh- he seemed to be impress with my ability to orate...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"41:22",@'
He didn't know what the- the term was...?
But then like, uhm... at some point AFTER I had this conversation with him, I
started to reflect on the conversation that I had with him, and I had varying degrees
of perceptions regarding the interview that I had with this guy, and I recorded it on
an audio recording...
'@)

$File.X(0,"41:42",@'
And I don't know he's aware that I did that, and uh, I started to get this feeling
as if there IS like a group of people, that like, go around, silencing certain people
in order to like, reduce their exposure to the rest of the world...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"41:59",@'
Either because that person is extremely fucking intelligent, and they wanna contain
that person, OR it could also be because, like uh- somebody is very jealous and is
very worried that uh- somebody like me, might be onto the right track, and then they
have to mislead me, and send out an investigator that has a TOTALLY different voice
than the Jeff Brown that I spoke to back on, uh- Ma- uh- February 2nd, 2001- uh- 21...
'@)

$File.X(0,"42:31",@'
And I know that the person I was speaking to, was the person that I referenced, 
because, the voicemail prompt. The voicemail prompt, the name and the voice sounded
TOTALLY different, and...? (It was the same guy, he just sounded different in person)
'@)

$File.X(0,"42:46",@'
Ya know, the guy that I spoke to...? 
I think he was either the FBI or the CIA.
I could be wrong about that, but- ya know, uh- sometimes I get clues from uh- the environment.
And, uh- what I've noticed is that I- have contacted these important agencies more than the 
average citizen would, because of like- the company. That I started. And uh... ya know...?
When I tell people, "Hey, um, I'm an expert...? And uh- Ya know, I know when people are lying
to my fucking face...?"
'@)

$File.X(0,"43:22",@'
Ya know...? They're gonna send guys like, uh- the guy I spoke to yesterday...
'@)

$File.X(0,"43:27",@'
Honestly, I'm not sure what to think, because... uh- while... there is the possibility that
he was telling me the truth...? Ya know, my impression was that I believed him. But- he
could've very well lied to me, and I believed him.
'@)

$File.X(0,"43:43",@'
So, what that raises to m- what question that raises to me, is this... right...?
If someone is avoiding to have a conversation with me, and isn't calling me...?
And uh- I notice subtle changes to like how my day-to-day operations have been going...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"44:00",@'
I have to conclude that something is f- something fucked up is goin' on, and, I have to
be considerate that, ya know, no amount of time is gonna change the situation, because,
uh-
'@)

$File.X(0,"44:15",@'
If I notice that I am being squelched, to the degree where you know, I'll notice the
subtleties, right...? Much more than the average person would. What uh- most people
might not understand, is this...
'@)

$File.X(0,"44:35",@'
I do believe that there may be one agency that controls the entire world.
'@)

$File.X(0,"44:41",@'
And that like, all of the countries around the world, they are subordinates to the main
control mechanism. I say main control mechanism because- I don't really know what else
to call it.
'@)

$File.X(0,"44:53",@'
Could be the New World Order. 
Could be like um, some... initiative.
Or, it could just be a- a group of rich people.
I'm really not certain.
'@)

$File.X(0,"45:04",@'
But what I have speculated, is that agencies like the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office, 
they- they uh-
'@)

$File.X(0,"45:15",@'
If the people that work there, think that I'm an intelligent dude, they'll have a 
conversation with me like they did yesterday, and they'll ask me a single question, like:
'@)

$File.X(0,"45:25",@'
What year did you graduate high school...?
Or uh- what high school did you go to, Shen...?
I'll be like 'Yup.'
'Alright, what year did you graduate from high school...?'
'2003'
'@)

$File.X(0,"45:37",@'
So what these questions are doing is establishing a baseline, for whether
the investigator can trust the information that they're hearing from me.
Because they have to be able to screen whether someone's bullshitting them
or not.
'@)

$File.X(0,"45:50",@'
Based on the conversation that I had yesterday with this guy who claims to be
Captain Jeff Brown, um... What I have uh- surmized is that... he's not the 
same person I spoke to on February 2nd, 2021... (he was actually)
'@)

$File.X(0,"46:07",@'
And like, the conversation that I recorded, and like, I attempted to follow up
with this dude at some point in the past...? And, uh- I may have even sent an
email that was dedicated to the guy that I spoke to, uh- to the guy that-
back in 2021, to the investigator that I spoke to yesterday, if he was an 
investigator.
'@)

$File.X(0,"46:30",@'
Ya know, sometimes what'll happen is uh- I'l detect subtleties that other people
will gloss right over, even though I haven't listened to the audio recording I
recorded of me speaking with him (obviously I have since I originally recorded
this...) uh- I thought about that conversation, like, ever since I left.
'@)

$File.X(0,"46:50",@'
Because, one of his responses uh- indicated to me... that the dude knew who I was,
and, he was trying to keep that on the down low... but I could be wrong about that.
Because, he was writing a bunch of stuff down... uhm...
'@)

$File.X(0,"47:12",@'
These are the speculations that I make as a programmer.
I have to assume that like, uh- that nobody knows nothin' about anything, whenever
I speak. And then, when I repeat myself, and I frame the entire narrative, or uh
the details of the story...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"47:28",@'
I have to like, consider, that like, when I talk to a new person that they have 
absolutely zero information or details or knowledge about the story I'm telling
them, and what this causes is for me to have to exert more energy with every
person that I speak to, because... some people uh- I have to be considerate of
uh- overloading people with information that they won't be able to process.
'@)

$File.X(0,"47:52",@'
So, when I do this, what it causes is uh- situation where I have to look for
any form of body language that would suggest that the person I'm speaking to, 
they're listening to me, but they're not gonna be able to retain the information.
'@)

$File.X(0,"48:08",@'
So, that's why I printed up a document and I went to the Saratoga County Sheriffs
Office yesterday, and, some of those audio recordings ARE gonna be alarming.
'@)

$File.X(0,"48:18",@'
Mainly because, like, I've noticed that there are some lazy fucks that work at the
Saratoga County Sheriffs Office. And I've talked about it numerous times in many
of my documents, I've talked about it in many of my audio logs, and videos...
'@)

$File.X(0,"48:32",@'
And if I go around and I walk up to people, and I say "Yeah there are some lazy fucks
at the New York State Police AND the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office..." They're gonna
be like "I don't think that at all..."
'@)

$File.X(0,"48:42",@'
Yeah. Most people AREN'T gonna think that, because ya know, most people follow the
rules. And, uh most people, they're shaped and molded by uh- the- the societal
expectations, or normal uh- normal every day conversations that people have with 
each other.
'@)

$File.X(0,"49:00",@'
So if you are a really intelligent son of a bitch, like I am...?
And you are able to detect people, lying right to your face...?
What'll happen is that people will, like, try to play this game where, 
they don't, care if- you- if you know, that they're lying to you.
'@)

$File.X(0,"49:17",@'
Ya know, like I encounter this, alot. And it's why I encounter so much resistance,
because, people take a look at me, and they assume that I'm not smart enough to
know when they're bullshitting me. And, I- I am- a LOT smarter than I look.
'@)

$File.X(0,"49:30",@'
And people, like constantly underestimate me.
But- I didn't get that feeling at all when I went to the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office
yesterday, the Administrative Office, and I spoke with this guy named Captain Jeff Brown.
'@)

$File.X(0,"49:42",@'
There was another guy that came out WITH him, but- I didn't speak with, HIM... I spoke with, 
uh the guy that was in a white shirt, who claims to be Jeff Brown. Now, uh- consider this.
Right...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"50:02",@'
I have to be considerate of uh- ya know, being in a public place, so like certain details
I can say out loud...? But I'm not gonna do that all the time...? Uh... *sigh*.
'@)

$File.X(0,"50:19",@'
Tryin' to figure out how to migrate this uh- audio log.
I spoke about a character named Wrongful Robert earlier this morning, and uh- the reason why
I spoke about Wrongful Robert, is because there's a lot of people in society that think a lot
like Wrongful Robert.
'@)

$File.X(0,"50:39",@'
Wrongful Robert is basically, uh- everything you know is wrong.
And so like, when I try to tell people,
"Oh yeh, if you're a really smart person, then you might be being censored like I get..."
'@)

$File.X(0,"50:54",@'
And most people...? They're not censored, so they won't ever suspect that they're being
censored for anything, because people follow this hive mentality. So what I mean is this,
a lot of people, they'll watch the news, and they'll believe everything they see on the
news, because of the way that it is shaped.
'@)

$File.X(0,"51:11",@'
But- the news can be very misleading, and can lie about certain details.
Or, they can omit certain details that are very critical.
And so, it causes people to like, uh- believe the smaller components of a story, rather than
the overall structure, so, typically what happens is that people will have their perceptions
changed immeasurably, and they'll believe that basically, uhm...
'@)

$File.X(0,"51:36",@'
If an agency decides to tell a portion of a story, they wanna tell the story, but they only
want to tell where like uh- certain elements of the story illuminate that they're like
responsible individuals that never lie to people, and- or mislead them, they wanna demonize
basically any enemies of theirs, and so- and so what'll happen is this...
'@)

$File.X(0,"52:00",@'
Uh- suppose that a police officer whips out their gun, and they shoot an innocent uh- person
for no fuckin' reason... I saw this video, um, where a guy was like outside of his house, or
something...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"52:18",@'
And like, uh- a police officer THOUGHT that he had a GUN in his hand...?
Like sh- may or may not be true...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"52:26",@'
But the police officer thought that the guy had a gun in his hand, but he didn't have a gun
in his hand at all...? And that police officer shot that man and killed him.
'@)

$File.X(0,"52:37",@'
So, uh... the reason why it would be dangerous for a police officer to continue being a police
officer, is if that person lied, in order to like, save their ass.

So what I mean specifically, is this...

If HE didn't think that the guy had a gun in his fuckin' possession AT ALL, and he just fuckin'
shot him because, like, he STARTLED him...

Well what THAT says, is uh- there's a small window, of uh possibilities
that the cop just felt like shooting the fuckin' uh- person, and then lying about it.
'@)

$File.X(0,"53:14",@'
And then like uh they'll be grilled by like, their superior, and then the superior will be like 
Did you like, just shoot him cause you felt like it...?
Or, was it an accident...?
Did you think that he had a gun in his hand...?

And what'll happen is sorta like having to believe a kid, that uh- 
You know, uh, wants to like uh- like uh- when my son, would like, uh- hit my daughter...?

And then like, my son would be like "Well, SHE started it..."
'@)

$File.X(0,"53:47",@'
Oh, DID she start it...?
Or did you just feel like hitting your sister for no reason...?

Well, heh.
Believe it or not, it's basically the same situation but the- the stakes are a lot higher.
'@)

$File.X(0,"54:01",@'
And so, uh- as an unintended side effect of all that, I do realize that the police officers 
that are out there...? Their sense of humor is desensiti- is like, bascially, uh- over time, 
they become uh, less receptive to humor, because of the fucked up things they see on a 
constant basis. So...
'@)

$File.X(0,"54:25",@'
When I come along, and I capitalize on my sense of humor, it causes other people to be, uh-
like, repulsed to some extent in some circumstances. Or like, they'll be offended by the language 
that I use, rather than like, the fuckin' principle of the things that I'm attempting to explain 
to people.
'@)

$File.X(0,"54:47",@'
Right...? So like, if I say that Trooper Rufa from the New York State Police, he sucks guys
dicks BEFORE, uh- at- during every arrest he makes, if it's a GUY, he WILL... he'll go around
and he'll fuckin', if he's arresting (2) guys at the same time...? He'll suck BOTH of their
dicks. One right after another.
'@)

$File.X(0,"55:09",@'
And, uh- ya know, whether it's true or false, does anyone really give a shit...?

No, I don't think that anyone really gives a shit, including him.
I think, that if ANYTHING...?
If he is like, uh, like a police officer and he DOESN'T do that...? 

He's probably gonna get a chuckle out of it.

Wanna know WHY he'll get a chuckle out of it...?

Because, like...
'@)

$File.X(0,"55:28",@'
Even HE would never like
come up with something that audacious or that clever,
you know, he he might get a chuckle out of it because...

Uh, he's like:
'I have never experienced when like, anybody has tried to like, s- be very descriptive about like insulting me.'

And you know what, if anything it was probably Trooper Rufa that watched that fuckin' video multiple times, 
and he's like:
'This is fuckin' fucked up AND funny at the same time, how does he even talk like that...?'
'@)

$File.X(0,"56:02",@'
And then before you know it...? Ya know, he's... 
Actually walking around with a sense of pride. Like:
"Wow, this fuckin' dude took like 38 minutes out of his day to fuckin' talk 
shit about me, that's fu- that's fuckin' like impressive right there, dude... 
Ya know...? Holy fuck."
'@)

$File.X(0,"56:24",@'
So anyway, do I really think he's gonna fuckin' be ENAMORED by uh- the things I said in that
audio recording...? No... But, do I think he's gonna give a shit...? No...

Wanna know WHY he's not gonna give a shit...?

Because he's desensitized by the amount of fuckin' uh- dead people that he's had to scrape
out of fuckin, like uh, car wrecks or like uh- ya know arrest and prosecute because somebody
murdered somebody else, or like assaulted them or shot them, or whatever.

$File.X(0,"56:55",@'
Right, I'm not like oblivious to the fact that the police have a pretty difficult job...
I've said that numerous times before.

However, uh- the JOB that they do...?

It sometime- uh, sometimes it is substandard, and not satisfactory, and they have been SO 
desensitized that you really have to use every bit of evidence that you can against them, 
and that like if you notice that after having a conversation with an investigator like
Jeff Brown, like I did yesterday...?

$File.X(0,"57:25",@'
I went all the way to- I went to, a bunch of places last night, or the other night, not last night.
I went to the Clifton Park-Half-, uh, the Clifton Park Pubic Safety Building, left a notice there...
I went to the Clifton Park-Halfmoon Public Library, left a notice there...
I went to Carol Yates' house, I left a notice there...
I went to Sysco, on One Liebach Lane, left a notice there...
'@)

$File.X(0,"57:55",@'
Sysco is a place that I used to work about 20 years ago, in uh- 2000... 4, I believe... 2003 or 2004, 
I'm not sure uh... I spoke about that in a audio log somewhat recently (02/02/23) when uh, the weather
here was like -15 degrees, and like, I could remember working in, at the Sysco warehouse in the fuckin' 
freezer. 

And it was so fuckin' cold in that fuckin' freezer, that like, you could not have ANY exposed skin 
whatsoever unless, ya know, you wanted to have frost bite. And that's how bad it was that night.

And uh- ya know- oh, it smelled like ice cream in there.
And like, ya know, I worked really hard, and I fuckin', like...
'@)

$File.X(0,"58:35",@'
I got caught- I got caught in a situation, where like, the people that worked there a lot longer than me...?
They like- tricked me. And they started puttin' fuckin' shit in the wrong fuckin' places.

And, ya know, this is how like soc- people in society do the same fuckin' shit, where they try to trick people
that are like gung-ho, and look like uh- they're gonna fuckin' make it mad far, right...?

And so, society is littered with all of these uh- tricks, and traps, and booby traps, and uh-
the investigators, the police, and all of them...? They fuckin' use all of these tricks...?

The news and the media, they use all of these fuckin' tricks...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"59:13",@'
Uh, like uh- people in society...? They use all these tricks...?
And really, like in ALL of these uh, components in society that I'm talking about...?
They really DO run on the notion that there's NO WAY that someone like Michael Cook could be SMART ENOUGH
to EXPLAIN the STUPIDITY of people that are like, highly respected and have a lot of money, or uh- reputation
or trust, from uh- people all around society.
'@)

$File.X(0,"59:36",@'
And, its- the reason why like, humans are fuckin' stupid.

Right...? Hu- human ha- humans have a serious problem. They're fuckin' stupid, and they will use every, 
like uh- their credibility or reputation to fuckin' slander other people. 

And, they'll use every trick at their fuckin' disposal to prevent somebody like ME, from like, makin' em look 
stupid~! They will.

And then even AFTER I've exposed how fuckin' stupid they'll look, they'll look- they'll, they'll like try to
use ANY fuckin' excuse they can think of, because- they know that as long as people believe whatever the fuck 
they say...?

Then it doesn't matter if I make them look stupid.
But- to what extent...?

And that's why I do what I do.

So, after I went to Sysco, I went all the way to.. uh, lets see.
Where the hell did I go next...?

...the... GlobalFoundries | https://youtu.be/1s-qefkOjXQ
And then I recorded a video...? I didn't leave a notice there, but I recorded
the video.

$File.X(0,"01:00:33",@'
And then I went to TEC-SMART, and then I left a notice there, uh- on both sides of the building,
and then uh- recorded an audio recording, right...? And then uh- I... went back to Route 9, and
went to the Malta Town Hall, left a notice there... Right...?

And then I went to the Stewarts Corporation and left a notice there, and then I went to the...
the uh- 135 Broadway, the uh Saratoga County Mental Health building, the back door, left a notice 
there...?

And then I went to... the Saratoga Springs Public Library and left a notice there...?
Uh- where'd I go after that...?
Oh yeh, I went to the Saratoga City Hall, left a notice there, right...?
And then I went to the Salvation Army, left a notice there...
And then I went to the Saratoga Hospital, the Mental Health Unit...
And I was ATTEMPTING to leave a notice on the door there, when Eric came out, the social worker.

And then he and I spoke for a few minutes...?
And I detected like some of his fuckin' responses were pretty nonchalant, and uh- ya know, I realize
that having a conversation with somebody like THAT, is a fuckin' waste of my time...?

And so, like uh- I kept it as fuckin' limited as possible, because like, ya know...?
Fuckin' I could detect, like, that the dude didn't really give a shit about what I was saying.
Right...?

I started recording an audio recording of me, like, basically making fun of him.

So, when I go to these places, right...?
And I leave these notices, I know that, like, what I'm doing is like, rubbing it in.
And these people think that I'm just being fuckin' stupid, but- the- the reality is that I'm causing
some people to be pretty fuckin' concerned. And that's why, like I'll notice something the following
day, of like, a video that I posted, uhm, having like no views on it, no likes, and like sort of like
extrapolating from uh, like the other day or whatever...?

After I recorded the vi- the audio recor- after I went to the Saratoga County Mental Health (meant Hospital MHU),
with uh- Eric, the social service worker, I uh- had a flat tire...? Had to go to the nearest, uh- Stewarts, and
then fill it up there, and I rode the bike from like, Stewarts, all the way to another Stewarts, and heated up
some pizza...? Right...?

And after I heated up that pizza, and was about to leave, the lady was like:
"Oh, you're ridin' around on your bike, huh...?"
And I was like "Yeh yeh yeh."
So like, this is the Stewarts on Northline Road. (my old Q107 Times Union stop)

They'll be able to say:
"Oh, yeh yeh yeh, some dude came in around like, fuckin' 9 o'clock, and he asked to use the microwave, holy shit.
His name was Michael Cook...? And he was like, on a fuckin' mission that day."

And so, like... I continued all the way through Ballston Spa, until I got to where the Chocolate Factory is, 
where Anthony Russo had his company uh- uh, what was it, uh- Adirondack Technologies, and I think he eventually
started like Tech Valley Talent, or whatever...? Right...? Uh- 

Anthony Russo, and his daughter uh- Nicole Russo, and I have some history...?
Uh- I'm not gonna talk about that in this particular audio recording, but what I WILL say, is that I went to
the top of the hill there, and I remember that my friend Alex's- Alex Philipsak's grandmother used to live-
Vita, used to live, uh on the corner there...? Uh- at the top of the hill. And then right around the corner
from the Saratoga County Fair, and then...? I just continued on to where- toward the uh- the Saratoga County
Sheriffs Office, Administrative Office.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:04:48",@'
And, on my way there, I saw a couple- a few vehicles that were being driven by the- the Sheriffs that work
at the fuckin' building. And I could tell that they WERE the Sheriffs because, like- I dunno, the way that
they drive their vehicles sometimes, like an aura of like:
"Hey, I might be a cop...? But I might NOT be, how could you tell...?"
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:05:08",@'
Well, uh- sometimes you can tell when a cop is drivin' around, but like, it's sort of like the same idea
as like, uh- texting some girl, and getting a baseline of like how they respond to text messages, and then
all of a sudden, you say something that pisses them off and then they react totally differently, and they'll
be like:
"Well, I fuckin' had a barbeque on... Pluto to go to, dude. You know...? I'm sorry, I just got back. Uh-
You said you wanted to hang out and have sex, or whatever...? Fine, let's do it, how about like, next Thursday?"
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:05:39",@'
It's like "Well, you used to like, answer your phone within like, 10 minutes and wanna like do- like, meet 
up within an hour, so... Now...? You like, you're taking like, 10 years to get back to me and you wanna meet
up in like, 30 years...? Yeh, nah, something is different right now."
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:05:53",@'
And then so like, most people in society, they're stupid, and they won't notice those fuckin' subtle differences.

And like, I don't wanna say that EVERYBODY's fuckin' stupid, but like, a lot of people...? They like to use 
this fuckin' tactic where like "Oh, Michael Cook thinks he's smarter than he really is, so maybe he's a fuckin
megalomaniac..."
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:06:10",@'
No, I don't think so.
I think what happens is that I encounter people that fuckin' underestimate me, and then they start to use these
fuckin' tactics that work on everybody else, and then when I start to fuckin' talk about things that really 
matter to ME, I will catch some resistance from people, because they'll try to say stuff like:

"Oh, well, you think you're more important than you really are, dude...
You know, there's no way that Mark Zuckerberg would throw a stack of cash at somebody at Google to minimize
your fuckin' visibility...? Your number of views...? Your view count...? Or like, you know, downsample the
fuckin' resolution of the videos that you're uploading...? Uh- ya know...? It's all in your fuckin head~!"

$File.X(0,"01:06:44",@'
And that IS what people fuckin attempt to like, convey to me, right...?
And then, like, ya know I accurately uh- observe and predict people's behaviors and then what'll happen is
that people'll be like:

There's no way that your prediction- you're psychotic~! Cause you're- You're predicting something that is SO
fucking stupid, and unrealistic, that like I have to say, that, sounds unrealistic, even if it is entirely
realistic, that like, uhm, some girl that you WERE having sex with, that would respond in like an hour, or
like, ten minutes, NOW she's taking 3 days to get back to you... anytime that you wanna have sex with her, 
and you say something to her like, hey lets fuckin' meet up. Uh~! Nah, she had a barbeque on Pluto to go to,
and she just got back, so like, there's NO WAY that she got the text message of that, she like READ the text
message, and she was like, you know what I'm gonna fuck this other guy...? 
For the- and then like, you know...? 
Fuck (5) more guys for the next (2) days, and on the third day, THEN, when I have nothing else to do, I'll t-
I'll text him back, and I'll come up with some stupid excuse or whatever, there's no way that he'll ever know
that.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:07:56",@'
And THAT'S why I say most people are fuckin' stupid. Because, people really do like to play that stupid.
They really do. There is no fuckin' way, that some girl, who wants to get fucked all the time, and texts
within like 10 minutes of texting her, and like meets up within an hour... that SUDDENLY she's gonna take
(3) days, to fuckin' get back to ya and like:

[Her]: Oh well, I ALWAYS have my (2) phones on me, but for like (3) days...? 
       I was stuck in the fuckin' wilderness, up in like uh- ya know, Whiteface mountain area, Lake Placid. 
       Yeah, I was bein' chased by fuckin' wolves...?
       And uh- ya know, I- I- lost my glass slipper...?
       Right before the- the clock hit midnight...? 
       And I fuckin'- I dunno, dude. 
       Fuckin', I just- I didn't know WHERE the hell I was, I fuckin' like, I started rollin-
       tumblin' down a hill after the wolves were chasin' me...?
       And once uh- ya know, I got to the bottom of the hill, I guess I got knocked out cold...
       Ya know, like uh-
[Guy]: So how did you not freeze to death...?
[Her]: Well, I didn't freeze to death because I was prepared for the elements, I wore a really nice jacket,
       and I had like, you know, (3) layers of, you know, my- my grandmother always told me 'Wear (3) layers
       of fuckin' clothes, make sure that you don't get hypothermia~!'
       You know...?
       Been livin' in fuckin' in the Adirondacks for like millions of years, basically.

And then you'll be like:
[Guy]: Well, you mean like, not MILLIONS of years, but like, years, right...?
And then she'll be like:
[Her]: Nah, fuckin' my family has been like- it- it's been a proven fact, my family has been living in the
       Adirondacks for millions of years. You know...? If you don't believe me, then fuck you, I don't care.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:09:29",@'
And then, like, you get to the point in the conversation where like:
[Guy]: You know, some of the shit that you're sayin' sounds really fuckin' stupid...
And then she'll be like:
[Her]: It's just your fuckin' opinion that what I'm sayin' is fuckin' stupid, you know...?
       Fuck you.
       You're stupid lookin'.
       You know...?
       Oh well.
       You know...?
       So what...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:09:46",@'
[Her]: So what if I was hangin' out with, fuckin'- the wolves or, some other dude.
       *pauses*
       OR I MEAN, like, uh, you know, who cares if I fell down the side of a mountain or
       like I got a dick thrown in my vagina repeatedly...
       *pauses*
       UH- I MEAN, UH...
       Who cares if uh- like, I'm lying to you-
       OR I MEAN, like, NOT lying to you, telling you- telling you how it really is, and
       telling you the truth.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:10:09",@'
Yeah, that's why I tell people that they're fuckin' stupid. 
It's because, people will blatantly fuckin' lie to people, and like, they know that like, 
it doesn't matter if like, they're believed or not... Because, like...

[Her]: Oh well.
       Fuckin' I fucked some other dude, and not YOU.
       There's no way that you'll ever know... who it was.
       And even if you did know who it was, you'll never know where we did it...
       And even if you do know where we did it, you'll never be able to catch us in the act...
       And even if you DO catch us in the act, there's no way that you'll ever be able to
       stop me from being able to continue doing it, because I'll just, stare you right in 
       the fuckin' face while this dude is poundin' me out, I won't give a shit.
       Even if like-
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:10:54",@'
Yeah, no, it's like, some people are fuckin' stupid. And uh- to some degree, I can ration-
I do agree with like, what OJ Simpson felt, when he realized that his wife was fuckin'
some other dude, but I don't think that he had any right to fuckin' kill both of them.

I think what he did was pro- profusely, uh- grotesque, right...? And, uh- you know there's
a fine line between like, uh- some guy being married to some woman and like seeing his wife
like, fucking some other dude...? And like, just, ya know, leaving the- the vicinity.

Versus, like, whipping- going, buying a gun, and like, not saying anything, and then boom.
Both of em are dead. Or like stabbin' em to death, or whatever.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:11:37",@'
Right...? And so like, uh- now I have to walk back all of the comments that I made so far, 
right...? Not walk them back specifically, to like, recant some of what I said, but because
I want to shape it to be more comedic rather than to be like an assault on uh- like uh 
law enforcement, or the justice system, or people in general, and like have a conclusion
where like anybody listening to this thinks that I'm just- this fuckin' asshole that thinks
that everybody is stupid...

I don't think that at all, I think that there's varying degrees of stupidity, and you know, 
when I say that people are fuckin' stupid, typically what I mean is that people are naive and
they don't care, if I tell them that they're naive, which causes me to think:

OK, so they're insulting my intelligence, and my existence, and they're triyng to say that
I'm fuckin' stupid, by sayin' that like:

"There's no way that Michael Cook, the fuckin' scruffy lookin' nerf herder could be correct.
Not at all."
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:12:31",@'
No, so, sometimes I will have a conversation like I did with the investigator yesterday, at
SCSO. Which is, where I went, after, I saw all the cops, driving down the street. And I also
saw like the bla- same style black Dodge Charger that I saw on May 26th, 2020.

And you know, I think that there is a very real possibility that, uh-
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:12:57",@'
The police attempted to fuckin' kill me that night.

Ya know, now I'm seein' a fuckin' Sheriff over across the way, Saratoga County Sheriff...
I don't think he's here for anything... ME related...

Uh, I think someone... hit another vehicle...?
And, now he's there. He's gonna fuckin'- I'm gonna like, narrate this whole interaction.

You know, not unlike the one that I did with uh- like, uh Clayton Brownell and some other
dude... you know, Clayton Brownell uh- is the night- is- uh- December 22nd, 2022...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:13:37",@'
Uh, Clayton Brownell and some other cop were talkin to some dude, and then you know, Michael
Whiteacre- uh- Michael Sharadin came out, and he was like, talkin' with em and stuff...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:13:48",@'
I think this might actually be like, Daniel Nelson...
Maybe not.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:13:58",@'
Yeah, I could tell like- some of the cops, they were this fuckin' cowboy hat.
Like Daniel Nelson does.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:14:07",@'
I don't think that's Daniel Nelson... nah, it's not.
Not entirely sure which one that is.
But- ya know, here's how like a good little investigator would go to town, and do some work.
Right...? Investigating shit...? It's 4168. And uh- he's talking with (3) adults...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:14:29",@'
He just turned his flashlight on, he's... fuckin'... checkin' on the radio, he's like:
"You know what, dude...? Fuckin', who the hell is this...? They just gave me their ID."

The other people, they're starin' at him, or they're like, lookin' at him, and talkin' to him...?

Right...? Here's what I'm gonna do... 
I wanna get in a vantage point where like the cop like realizes that I'm like narrating anything he's
doing...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:14:52",@'
Right...? Because this is what an investigator is SUPPOSED to do, what I'm doing right now.
If you like, SUSPECT that some of your buddies are doin' something fucked up, you're supposed to 
investigate that, not ignore it.

But anyway, (3) adults, they're standin' around, and uh- there's (1) woman, (2) guys, right across
the street from the Dollar Tree, right...? Cop, with the fuckin' hat on...? It's a winter hat...?

You know...? Not unlike the one that I usually wear, he's in his cruiser, right...? And he's bein'
cool, he's not bein' an asshole, or nothin'. He's just runnin' someone's fuckin' license like a good
cop.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:15:28",@'
I think he's by himself. Because... I don't think another cop is in that vehicle. 

Sometimes the cops double up, and they drive around and they're like:
[Cop 1]: Hey, you know what I fuckin' saw last night...?
[Cop 2]: What'd ya see...? What'd ya see last night...?
Then the cop will be like:
[Cop 1]: I fuckin' saw, like, some dude...? 
         Bangin' the snot out of his girlfriend...
         Like, through his window.
And the other cop will be like:
[Cop 2]: Really...?
He'll be like:
[Cop 1]: Yeh yeh yeh, I was sent on a mission to somebody's house, for like a welfare check.
         I didn't expect to see like, some dude, like basically eviscerating this fuckin' girl.
         I could see it through the window...
The other cop will be like:
[Cop 2]: Holy shit, you really saw that through the fuckin' window...?
[Cop 1]: Yup, I did, ya know...?
         And sorta like, ya know, I was like WOW, that dude is fuckin' really goin' to town.
And the other cop is like:
[Cop 2]: Wow, really...? He's fuckin' goin' to town... you fuckin' observed that...?
[Cop 1]: Yup. That's what happened, last night.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:16:24",@'
And these are the sorts of conversations that they'll have, in their cruiser, drivin' around.
Havin' a conversation with one another, and, you know...? 

Then they'll get a call on the radio, they'll be like:
[Dispatch]: Hey, there's been a fuckin' uh- a barbeque gone wrong, now there's like uh- bunch of
            people arguin' and somebody called us, said:
            'You guys need to come here, cause somebody's fuckin' doin' some shady trollmeister shit.'
And then the dispatcher will be like:
[Dispatch]: Alright, well, uh- you gotta fuckin' go to THIS address, and you gotta be there within a
            few minutes.
And then the police will be like:
[Police]: Well, is this an emergency...?
And they'll be like:
[Police]: Eh, we're not sure if it's an emergency...
And the dispatcher will say:
[Dispatch]: It's an emergency.
And then as soon as they hear the words "It's an emergency"
Uh- it's an emergency...?
Uh- they gotta fuckin' hit the lights...? 
And they gotta fuckin', put the foot to the floor, and they gotta fuckin' haul ass, dude...
And they gotta get there as soon as fuckin' possible, because there could be somebody tryin' to stab
somebody else, or shoot somebody else, and... they know that what they're drivin' into...?
Could be fuckin' like, their last call.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:17:23",@'
And so... they- they- they fuckin' pour all their effort into like, driving down every road...?
Like, with the lights on, and making damn certain that no vehicle is in the road...?
Like, that're like, gonna get in the way or nothin'...?
And they will like, blare on their siren, be like:
[Brrrt]-[Brrrt]-[Brrrt]-[Brrrt], [Brrrt]-[Brrrt]-[Brrrt]-[Brrrt], [Brrrrrrrrrrrrt]...
[Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt]

And then like, sometimes the fuckin' State Troopers will be like that too, they'll be like:
[Trooper]: Oh, uh- dudes, fuckin' goin' to a call, 
           Dude's goin' to a call...?
           He's goin' to a call...

And then so like now, fuckin' (10) cop cars are like "whoop~!"
They all have their lights on, they're all fuckin' action packed, they're drivin' like the dude
in the song Cake - uh- Goin' the Distance... they're goin' for-

[Cake]: They're goin' the distance, 
        they're goin' for speed...?
        She's all alone...?
        All alone in a time of need...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:18:13",@'
*group of people chattering*
[Me]  : Sorry, am I in your way...?
[Lady]: Nah.

Well, anyway...
There is not that much action goin' on with this call, that I'm observing.
Nah. Cop is just runnin' a fuckin' check. Looks like, he is... 

It doesn't look like it's fun...?
It doesn't look there's anything really bad goin on...?
It just looks like... (3) people...? Standin' next to a truck...?
Across the street from the Dollar Tree, and nothing shady is happening.

They're fuckin', they're actually jokin' around a bit, cause the girl is
smilin', she's laughin', she's like:

[Girl]: Oh this one time, my fuckin' like uh- you know, holy shit.
        Fuckin' told a joke, and uh- you know, it was funny.

And then, the guy, in his sweatshirt, he's like:
[Dude]: Yeh yeh yeh, I've told jokes that were funny, too.
        Ya know...? I got a beard. 
        And uh- who the hell cares...?
        Ya know...? We're just fuckin' (3) people standin' next to a truck,
        and there is a Sheriff doin' somethin'...
        So like, last time this shit happened to me...?
        Uh- it was in like, the fuckin' rougher part of Albany...?
        Yeah, and like (10) cops came, and then like, uh- eh- uh- the cops
        really had nothin' better to do, so like they all came...
        But then I was like 'It's not an emergency...'
        And the cops were like 'Oh ok, as long as it's not an emergency...'
        And then like (8) of em left, but another one like, stuck around, just
        as backup, just as- just in case.
        Ya know...? You never know if somebody like, down the street, is gonna
        like whip out a gun and start shootin' like 8-year-old little girls, 
        you know, you don't want that...
And so like the girl's like:
[Girl]: Wow, sounds like a fuckin' story...
He's like:
[Dude]: It is, it is. Definitely a fuckin' story... I'm just, you know...?
        Hangin' out.
        Fuckin', waitin' for the police officer to do what he's gotta do.
        Ya know...?

Sheriff, Saratoga County, serving... serving since 1791.
I think that's what it says. Since 1791.
Ya know...? Serving since 1791, because that is when... uh- Half Moon, uh, 
split into like (4) different towns, right?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:20:22",@'
There was Balls Town... so Ballston. Balls Town.
And then like Half Moon. Two words.
And then, uh- Saraghtoga with like the G-H.
And then like, there was another one, I can't remember.
Uh... damnit.
Maybe it might've been Gal Way, or somethin'. (Still Water)
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:20:47",@'
You know...?
Gal Way. But anyway, uh yeah.

I dont' think that I need to stick around and continue to narrate what's going on, because 
there is really nothing exciting about what he's doin'. And, not- same goes with the (3) 
people.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:21:07",@'
Right...? And so like, uh- the thing that I just did, is that I narrated, like, what was
goin' on'. Right...? So like, I narrated what I was seeing, and observing, and I recorded
it, and I'm pretty good at this, pretty fucking skilled at it, and so... I'm a fast talker,
when I wanna be...?

I know like, what behaviors to expect from people, and uh- you know, I think once people
realize that I'm a smart bastard, and I'm basically like a fuckin' parrot...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:21:37",@'
Then they're like:
[People]: Oh, so you're like, smart parrot like dudes, that remembers a whole bunch of shit, huh?
And then I'll be like:
[Me]    : Yup. I am one of those smart fuckin' parrot dudes that remembers a bunch of shit,
          and then reports the same shit that I see, and then, ya know, throws in a little bit
          of my vocal intonation changes, and characteristics and then, I'll swing in like a 
          fuckin'... crusader. This... caped crusader, like fuckin' Batman.
          And then I'll fuckin' whip out, like uh- the fuckin- the bat- uh- the Bat-A-Rang...?
          A couple Bat-A-Rangs, and I'll fuckin' throw em, and then like the Bat-A-Rangs will
          like shoot like this, rope, that like swings around somebody's feet, and then all of
          a sudden...?
          A bad guy that WAS tryin' to run away...?
          Now he's on the ground, cause, ya know, I used the weapon that fuckin', like wraps
          around his feet, and then nothing he can do about it. And then I do that to basically
          every story. I don't even know, how the hell I got to this point, either.
          I just realized that there was an urgent need for a guy like me, to come around.
          Do I sound more like a Batman...?
          Or do I sound more like uh- I dunno, dude...
          Somethin' other than Batman...
'@)

I'm not tryin' to make the fuckin' Batman voice.
I'm tryin' to make the fuckin', the voice for uh- I dunno.

I used to make this voice for my kids a lot. Right...?
Those- those are all CLUES, like an investigator, like Laura Hughes from the Saratoga County
Childrens Protective Services, like if she was good at her job, she could collect like, stuff
like 'evidence', and stuff. Like she DIDN'T do, back, in June of 2020.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:23:25",@'
Right, and so like, what caused me to start like, collecting clues and stuff, is because people
are... morons. They are careless fuckin' morons. They- they work at Shen, they work at a bunch
of places in the county, and like, they work in the fuckin' investigators office, I'm god damn 
certain of it, right...? Like, here's the conclusion that I'm about to make. Right...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:23:44",@'
The investigator that I spoke to yesterday, I don't wanna outright call him a lazy bastard, 
because the chances are that like, he's had to take on, like uh- the responsibility of uh- 
you know, solving murders and shit.

But- the case can ALSO be made, that he can use that as a fuckin' excuse, not to get back to me
or follow up on like MY investigation...? And so can the people at the FBI...? So can the
people at the State Police...? And like, what you find, is that like, SOMETIMES what they'll do
is like, they'll only investigate certain things. And if THEY investigate certain things, and 
then they pass it up to somebody who's NOT gonna put a whole lot of effort into the things that
I'm talking about, OR, if I've insulted Michael Zurlo too many times, and Michael Zurlo does not
feel like being all that cool with having a conversation with me, then he's gonna use a 
STALLING technique, rather than to like fuckin' call me, and have a conversation with me, about-
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:24:50",@'
May 26th, 2020... and a number of incidents SINCE then, because if anything...?
I've noticed that SOME of the exhibits that were submitted to Family Court, with judge 
Paul Pelagalli, they illuminate that like, people at the Saratoga County Offices were playin' 
fuckin' games with me, and they got really pissed about how I was like mischaracterizing some
of the things that they were saying, ya know, like...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:25:19",@'
Like this...
Ya know, Michael Zurlo, had a conversation with Captain Jeff Brown yesterday... He's like:
[Zurlo]: So, like, tell me about this conversation that you had with Michael Cook.
And then Captain Jeff Brown will be like:
[Brown]: Well...? Ya know...? He SEEMED like a level-headed dude...
         Seems like, he's pretty smart... and, ya know, he's got this WHOLE list of shit.
And like, Michael Zurlo will be like:
[Zurlo]: Well... fuck.
         Now that means that we have to like, casually look at fuckin' thing, don't we...?
And then Captain Jeff Brown's like:
[Brown]: Well...? We don't HAVE to, we could just like, ya know...? Avoid it.
         And then NOT like, investigate a god damn thing.
         If we don't want- if we want to.
And then like, Michael Zurlo will be like:
[Zurlo]: Well, I've been doin' that for like, almost (3) years, now...
         Ya know...?
         This is NOT good...
         Michael Cook is fucking here...
         And he's handed us, like a list of fuckin' things that he has been doing...
         You know...?
         And, uh... 
         It seems pretty apparent, that he is a really fuckin' smart dude...
         And I'm scared shitless... to have a conversation with him.
         Because, the chances are...?
         That HE'S gonna KNOW... if I lie to him.
         And the chances are...?
         That if YOU lied to him, during the conversation that you just HAD with him...
         Then, he is gonna know that he was being bullshitted...
         And it doesn't matter if he knows that NOW, or LATER...?
         Because, he probably recorded the conversation that you had with him.
         So NOW, like, we have to like REALLY work hard, and, uh...
         You know, sorta like fuckin' use a strategy from a totally different strategy
         or rule book...
And then Captain Jeff Brown will be like:
[Brown]: Well, you know...?
         Maybe we could turn this negative into a positive...
         You know, and like, uh- maybe we could hire him to be like an investigator,
         you know, since he's not an idiot...
And then Michael Zurlo will be like:
[Zurlo]: Over my dead body, dude.
         That kid has personally insulted me so many fuckin' times...?
         AND my son...?
         There is no way that I would ever allow him to be a part of my fuckin' police force.
         Not a fuckin' chance...
And then Captain Jeff Brown will be like:
[Brown]: Well, what if we like, ya know, fuckin' uh- I dunno, maybe he could work for a 
         different police force, then.
And then Michael Zurlo will be like:
[Zurlo]: No no no, not even another police force.
         We gotta fuckin' keep this under wraps, dude.
         There is no way, that, we can allow him to be an investigator ANYWHERE, because...
         ...he is gonna continue to investigate what happened back in...
         May 2020, as well as many of the people at the fuckin' county offices n shit...
         Ya know...?
         Cause we're fucked.
         Even if this guy is like, fuckin' homeless, and going door-to-door, and like, 
         fuckin' taping shit to doors and shit...?
         We're fucked.
Captain Jeff Brown's like:
[Brown]: Well, it's just your opinion, sir. 
         He might actually not be, you know, able to do any of that...
         And, it really just comes down to whether or not people believe us.
         And, ya know, if we like, have Google like, keep his traffic really low and shit...?
         And he just keeps saying really offensive, off-the-wall type shit...?
         No one will EVER believe a word that he says.
         Even if he does have the audio recordings.
         Of us having a conversation and stuff...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:29:15",@'
And Michael Zurlo... did he actually have a conversation with Jeff Brown like that...?
That went like that...? Probably not. Ya know...? Like, the reason why I'm like,
fictionalizing all of that...? Is because, like, worst case scenario, they DID have
a conversation like that.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:29:34",@'
Do I think it's realistic that they DID have that conversation...?
No... but at the same time, I am STILL able to consider, that it is SOMEWHAT PLAUSIBLE.

And, most people in society, they would never, ever, ever come to that conclusion, they
would never, ever, ever, think that was even a remote possibility at all... Because...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:30:00",@'
Uh- if these guys, if they lie to most people... they're gonna be believed. It doesn't
matter what the hell, if they lie or not, as long as people believe what they say.

That is what matters.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:30:15",@'
And that is what causes me to think that like, people are fuckin' stupid.
You know...? If you say something, it doesn't matter whether it's true or false, 
what matters is if people believe it. And that's it. And THAT is fuckin' extremely
dangerous, because- you know, if uh- ya know...

Fuckin' OJ Simpson... kills his fuckin' wife and Ron Goldman, and like, he's like
"There's no way that I would ever do that..." and people BELIEVE him...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:30:43",@'
Well, it means that certain people...
...they'll always be able to fuckin' lie to people... and be trusted.
And that is fuckin' very fuckin' dangerous.

That is so fuckin' dangerous...?
That...
I have to like, fictionalize stories like the one I just rattled off.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:31:01",@'
Not because I'm trying to demonize Michael Zurlo, ya know, I think I've
done that a number of times, but like, how does he know what my state of
mind was, any single time that I wrote any of the fuckin' documents that
I wrote, specifically naming him...? Or, citing him specifically...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:31:16",@'
Ya know, there's no way that he could ever come to that conclusion.
However, uh- the interactions that I've had with many of the officers 
have been recorded, I've been doing most of the recording for them, ya
know? They do have body cameras, but I highly doubt that they fuckin' save
all those- all that body camera footage, permanently.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:31:30",@'
If anything...? They probably save it for a while...? For each case where
they make an arrest or whatever, they save those.

But- they're not gonna fuckin' save like ALL of the footage of ALL the police
officers that wear a body camera, because they would have so much fuckin' god 
damn content to go through, they would have to have some way of categorizing
all of it...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:32:01",@'
But on the other hand, maybe they DO have enough- maybe they have enough
resources to be able to save all of that, or maybe it's fuckin' saved in Salt
Lake City, maybe there's a hard drive SOMEWHERE that's saving ALL of the 
information, and it's not a portion of the government, it's a corporation.

(Prism)
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:32:19",@'
Ya know, all of these things are TOTALLY realistic, to think that they're NOT
realisitic is pretty fuckin' naive. And I would go so far as to say, it's 
pretty fuckin' stupid for people to believe everything that the police will
say. You know...? Um...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:32:34",@'
That's why I keep reaching back to this notion that perhaps there's one agency
that oversees every single fuckin' place and everything, and like- you know, 
all of the cops all around the world, they all work together and like, fuckin-

No. That's fuckin' stupid, because- uh...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:32:53",@'
Ukraine and uh- Russia are legitimately killing each other, it is being seen, 
you are seeing like, dead bodies on the sides of fuckin' streets, and you are seeing
tanks being exploded in real-time... that WERE moving, and then after it exploded
it's NOT moving anymore...?

There HAD to have been somebody in that fuckin' tank...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:33:11",@'
Ya know, there might've been radio or remote controlled, but I highly fuckin' doubt it, 
ya know...? People are dying over in Ukraine and Russia. It is totally fuckin', uh- 
outside of the realm of, believable that like, there's one agency that controls every
fuckin' country in the world.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:33:32",@'
However, what I DO believe is plausible, is that- there is a- there is a group of people
that have a lot of money, and THEY fuckin' control people, like, whether they do it like
uh- uh, like uh... 

(Davos/World Economic Forum/New World Order)
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:33:48",@'
Consciously...? Or, subconsciously...? That's... hard to say.
But- I DO think that it is entirely possible, that- uh, the idea of rich people controlling
the entire world, and having the entire world wrapped around their fuckin' finger, it goes
way beyond like, the clutches of fuckin', like, the top 10 billionaires.

What I'M talking about is like, people that have no fuckin' money somehow having control
over society. And that's fuckin' dangerous, because then they can just lie- in the same
manner as OJ Simpson. And then fuckin' lie to every fuckin' constituent, or citizen, or
whatever...? Litigant...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:34:30",@'
Right...? And then like, they have to play stupid... whenever somebody indicates that
they're doin' somethin' fuckin' stupid, or they sound stupid, or they act stupid...?

Ya know...?
They're gonna work fuckin' overtime, to like, silence people like me.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:34:43",@'
And rather than to silence me, they could put my skills to use and make me a valuable
asset somewhere, or make an investment into my company- but I've noticed that, like, 
some people are very hesitant to do that because of how fuckin' intelligent I am.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:34:58",@'
I might be wrong about that...?
But I don't think I am because I notice a lot of resistance.
And whether like, uh- the conversation I had with the investigator yesterday, uh-
he didn't exhibit any resistance, but when I said that I've written a number of 
documents about Michael Zurlo, and uh- I'd like to have a conversation with Michael
Zurlo, and uh- if we have a conversation and I believe what he says, then my documents
will require and update.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:35:24",@'
And then like, uh- as soon as I said that...?
This guy Jeff Brown was like 'Well, that'd be nice.'
Right...? So like, ya know, I'm not a- like oblivious to the notion that the police
like, the- they- they get desensitized by what happens in the real world, but they
ALSO get desensitized by the fact that like, some people really do have like fucked 
up, like uh- things goin' on in their mind...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:35:48",@'
So like, they don't really wanna take the time out of their day, to fuckin' like
decide- to, to figure out or determine whether or not, like I'm IN my mind, inside
my mind, and just fuckin' playin' games with them...? Cause they're playin' games
with me...? Or, if like, uh- someone on their fuckin' team, is like, actually
dropping the ball a number of times, and so are the people in the fuckin' like, uh-
the county agencies that I've had to deal with ...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:36:11",@'
And uh- I think that that perplexes them. And so, like, they're not gonna investigate
something like, overnight. I'm aware of that, it's gonna be a slow burn, it's gonna
be like uh- every single moment that this du- if this dude had a genuine conversation
with me yesterday, which I believe IS the case...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:36:30",@'
Uh- it's gonna be him, applying some effort during moments where there's a very low
number of things for him to do, which- it could be awhile. But at the same time...?
Uh...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:36:45",@'
This case is over 3 ye-, it's about (3) years old, right...?
And uh- I've already caught a number of uh- a number- a level of resistance from a 
prior investigator that called me back. (same investigator)

I called the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office on February 1st, 2021...
and then, this guy that I believe was Captain Jeff Brown, maybe it was Tim Brown, 
like uh- Jeff Brown said (it wasn't), yeah they're cousins or somethin'...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:37:15",@'
Ya know that should speak volumes right there, I remember many of the things that
this dude said, and I haven't even listened to the recording. Haven't even
listened to the recording that I recorded of me speaking with him, and I remember
some of the things he said just fine, and his like- uh, reactions.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:37:33",@'
I also remember, like, the other guy was like:
'Here, Captain, here ya go. Here's like a pen and a piece of paper, or whatever.'
Right...? And he started writin' down, he's like askin' me:
'When did this incident occur...?'
I say, uh- 'June 28th, 2022', and I say- and I told them that I had a- audio 
recording, I make audio recordings much like I'm talkin' right now, and uh- ya know
I didn't realize that the thing was still recording the environment from the 
following 16 hours, and I told uh- I uploaded it to the- the- my Google Drive
account before uh- my mother called 911 or whatever, and then uh-
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:38:09",@'
And then uh- I told them about having uploaded this audio recording, and they 
STILL arrested me, and he's like:
"Well, that's not very nice..."
And I was like "Nah, nah..."
And uh, I think that's a key feature of what I keep experiencing.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:38:31",@'
If people want me to act nice and professional, then they should act-
they should take some notes from the guy that I spoke to yesterday.

But at the same time, I don't wanna drop my guard.
Because I know that when people are nice, that... 
...it is a potential attack vector.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:38:46",@'
And that is something that I sensed, to a very minor degree when I talked
with him, but not while I was there, it was only AFTERWARD, after I left. 

And I started to reflect on the conversation that I had with him.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:39:00",@'
So...
With all of those things having been said, I don't know if this guy is an
actual investigator for SCSO...? Or if he's like, FBI, or State Police, or
CIA...? Or whatever...?

But what I am damn certain of, is that uh- the people at the NSA, the FBI and
the uh... the FBI, NSA, CIA, all of these agencies have heard of me.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:39:23",@'
And I am very certain that they have been- some of them, probably are rallying
for me, to fuckin' do something cool or awesome, in my lifetime...?

And, there might be somebody like, Michael B.T.D.T. Pompeo.
And I'll tell you what Michael B.T.D.T. Pompeo, stands for.

'@)

$File.X(0,"01:40:11",@'
Why do they call him "Bathtub dick-time" Pompeo...?
Is because, the man plays with his dick in a bathtub...? A lot.
He calls that "hard work".
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:40:26",@'
Because, playing with your dick, in a bathtub, if it IS hard...?
Then you can tell people that is "hard work", even though, that is not hard
work at all...? That's just some dude, in a bathtub, playing with his dick.
And just- havin' a lot of fun doin' it.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:40:51",@'

$File.X(0,"01:41:05",@'
How does he do it...?
Does he use shampoo...?
Does he use, Vaseline...?
Does he just play with it raw...?
These are the questions that I ask myself, when I think about Julien Assange
sitting in a fuckin' prison, for like exposing Vault 7, among various other
things. And...

You know, I'm not gonna say anything BAD about Barack Obama at all...?

And, uh...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:41:48",@'
Actually, I don't think that uh- Pompeo was the director of the CIA when uh-
Barack Obama left the- left the office. Or, maybe he was, I can't remember.
I think- I think he was, and uh- yeh, I dunno.

I know that Julien Assange was raided and arrested in uh- 2019.

         the first black hole...? Tomorrow...? And then tomorrow, I'm gonna
         make a NEW video, and I'm gonna talk about how, like, what I predict
         and then, uh- we- thanks for watchin'.

And then, uh- the next day came...?
And then, uh- Derek Muller's like:
[Derek]: Alright, folks so I've looked at the, the first picture of the black hole...?
         And, you're never gonna believe this, but- the light is the shadow, and the
         shadow is the light, and that's fuckin' cool as fuck, isn't it...?

He's like:

         No way that anyone would ever be able to like, say that it's stupid, dude.
         Cause this shit's awesome.

And then his buddy'll be like:
[Buddy]: Heh, thanks dude.
Ya know...? No- And then- he- he'll be like:
[Derek]: No problem, dude.
         You really shouldn't be like, ya know, fartin' as much as you do.
Ya know, like uh-
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:44:10",@'
You have to consider, like...
SOME of the things I'm saying are gonna make ANYBODY laugh their asses off, right?

And, uh- if I am failing to cause like, somebody like Michael Zurlo to laugh...?
It's probably because he has done a lot of heinous shit. And like...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:44:34",@'
Ya know, I would venture a guess as to like, even Eric Catricala and Bruce Tanski
will have, laughed their asses off at some of the shit that I've been uploading
or recording, or whatever. BUT- if I record something, and I make fun of 
Bruce 'jiggletits' Tanski, and like, he doesn't fuckin' say anything to me...?
And he's like:
[Tanski]: Stop makin'- stop sayin' negative shit about me, dude.
          What the fuck...?
          Ya know, I might be the guy that's been like, hittin' the thumbs up
          button on like, all of your videos over the last X amount of time.
          Ya know...?
          MAYBE I did think it was funny, that you like said that me, and uh- 
          John Hoffman like, were fuckin', ya know, puttin it in each other's
          poop chutes or somethin'.
          Ya know...? Maybe I will think that shit was MAD funny, because
          there's NO WAY that I would EVER fuck that dude.
          And there is no way, that I would ever pull my dick out of John
          Hoffman's asshole, and not even wash it...?
          And then have my wife suck on it... and then, ya know, when I see,
          the look, on my wifes face, like, tasting John's asshole...?
          On my dick...?
          I would, fuckin'-
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:45:54",@'
*laughing profusely*
You know...? Uh-
*laughing profusely*
What the fuck...
THAT is genuinely how I laugh when I listen to the shit that I record.
And I KNOW that other people, they laugh a lot like that, too.

They might not laugh like that at FIRST, like:
"What the fuck, is this dude, like out of his fuckin' melon or somethin'...?"

But- I have been practicing this.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:46:32",@'
Ya know...? I'm not like fuckin' like, uh- livin' on planet fuckin' Neptune...
When I say something, it's strictly meant to get a reaction out of people.
So, if I notice that people aren't reacting or whatever...?
It's because, they ARE reacting, and they're like, they're either repulsed by
it, or it caused them to laugh so fucking profusely, that they don't wanna make
any indication whatsoever, that they found what I said, to be outright fucking
hilarious.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:47:02",@'
Because, then it would like encourage the type of behavior that like, ya know,
it's like, WORTH SOMETHING TO SOCIETY IN SOME WAY. So like, if... Bru- if I
come up like a- fuckin' made-up skit where like Bruce Tanski, like, has a
conversation with uh- John Hoffman, he's like-
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:47:26",@'
[Tanski] : I could pull MY dick out of YOUR asshole, not even wash it, and
           then make my wife suck it, and then like, she'll make the face
           where I KNOW she tastes it...? 
           But- she will fuckin' pretend like she doesn't taste it at all.
And then John Hoffman will respond:
[Hoffman]: Wow, dude. 
           That's fuckin'...
           That's-
           I'm impressed.
And then Bruce Tanski'll be like:
[Tanski] : Yeah, I'm fuckin' impressed with myself too, dude.
           Ya know...?
           Holy shit.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:47:55",@'
Do I actually think that they would do that...?
No...?
But- it's fuckin' funny.
They got a lotta money, and if they have a sense of fuckin' humor...?
They're gonna find that shit funny too. And they're gonna try to like 
come up with ways of, like, ya know, being involved in the joke...?

But at the same time they wanna be taken seriously by other people...?
And then like, you know, I would venture a guess as to say that like,
Chad Gregory, would even get a kick out of that.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:48:23",@'
Because, you know, I spoke about Chad a number of times in the audio
recordings that I've made, as well as Dan Pickett, and like, all of
these important people that uh- I've known growing up and shit...?
Like...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:48:37",@'
Talking about them in either my documents, or in my audio recordings, 
it's meant to get a rise out of them SOMEHOW... but they're used to like 
uh- everybody else sorta like, going along with what societal expectations
are, and they don't wanna let me know, that like, they're payin' attention...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:48:56",@'
And they think that I have somethin' goin' on.
Because, they have somethin' goin' on.
And they don't wanna fuckin' let the cat out of the bag.
Not at all.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:49:06",@'
Because, like uh- if I was a rich bastard, and I was successful, and I could
walk up to anybody and lie to them, and they would believe me...?

Then, you bet your ass that like, if I- if I saw some kid poking fun at me, 
and coming up with genuinely hilarious fuckin' skits and shit...? I would have
to keep that shit to myself, because if I-
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:49:28",@'
If I know that some kid is gonna be fuckin' recording a conversation with me,
and like I start laughing or make it known to him...? That like, when he's 
making fun of me I'm also laughing along with the joke...?
Then... then, basically a lot of people, they're gonna be like:
[People]: Well, you think that what he's sayin' is fuckin' funny...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:49:47",@'
And then uh- they'll have to admit it, and be like:
[People]: Yeh, this fuckin', this kids' fuckin'... this dude is funny.
And then the people that like thought that I was just delusional or sick in
the fuckin' head, they're gonna be like:
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:50:00",@'
[People]: Well, if the dude that he's makin' fun of is like- finds that shit
          funny, then maybe it IS funny after all.

And THEN what happens is, uh- people'll be like:
[People]: Well, this dude is- I thought that he was like this big fearsome 
          fuckin' dude, or whatever... NOW I realize that he's been involved
          in the joke that whole fuckin' time...?
          What the fuck is goin' on here...?

Ya know...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:50:25",@'
And that is basically the situation. Right...?

Do I think that Eric Catricala's goin' around, like giving bodies a touch-up?
After like, serial killers go and like, slice people's throats open while
they're sleepin'...? After Center for Security like breaks into somebody's
fuckin' like, house, or their lock or whatever...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:50:43",@'
Well, I mean it's a theory, I don't know what it's plausibility is, but I would
say that it's relatively low... but- given the circumstances of what I have 
observed, I think the- as low as it is,  it's still far above 0 percent, right...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:51:01",@'
I do think that certain people are being killed by these fuckin' spies or these 
fuckin' assholes. Do I think it's gonna be the average, every-day citizen that
works at fuckin' Dunkin' Donuts, or like, uh- Stewarts, or like, uh- fuckin, or
like uh- I dunno, Burger King, or whatever...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:51:17",@'
No~! It's NOT gonna be any of those people. And so, THOSE people are going to find
like, my comedy, my sense of comedy and my sense of humor, and my intellect to be
like fuckin' stupid, because it doesn't apply to them.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:51:29",@'
You know, they're very low on the totem pole. And they think that they're above me,
because they have a job, they're getting paid, they're payin' their bills n shit.
And then when they see me walkin' around, lookin' like a homeless fuckin' vagrant,
they don't realize that I'm using my appearance...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:51:45",@'
I am intentionally like, I am like playing into this appearances can be deceiving.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:51:52",@'
Seeing is believing, but appearances may be deceiving.
And that's just it.

Somebody that has a lot of money is gonna appear to be very successful, and like, 
they're gonna appear to be very trustworthy as well, and credible.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:52:05",@'
But the fact of the matter is that people that ARE considered trustworthy and credible,
they lie too. They lie just as much as the next person. They don't wanna fuckin' say
it out loud, they don't wanna like admit like who- that they're a real person out loud,
where other people can get a sense of how human they are.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:52:25",@'
No, what they want is like for people to believe what they're seein' on the fuckin'
television. So when I fuckin' like blast like, people at WTEN for like sayin' uh-
Town officials said that the Chic-fil-a across the street from the Starbucks that
I was at, like when I wrote up a response to the fuckin' article, that like, holy
shit, the Chic-fil-a is gonna bring 100 jobs to the area...?
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:52:48",@'
You- ya- you're out of your fuckin' mind if you think that Chic-fil-a is gonna
bring 100 jobs to the area... Like even if they're construction jobs, uh- I doubt
it. The reason being, like uh- heh. There hasn't been 100 construction workers
building that Chic-fil-a.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:53:06",@'
And like, how could (1) restaurant bring in like, additional fuckin' places...?
But also, there's a bunch of fuckin' vacant spaces around here.
There's vacant property, there's vacant buildings, there's vacant lots, and 
property...? Like, there's businesses that are fuckin' closed... that are like, 
empty... and they say "For Sale", but- somehow, like someone Phil Barrett is
like:
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:53:33",@'
[Barrett]: The fuckin' Chic-fil-a construction is gonna bring (100) jobs to the
           area, dude...
           You better fuckin' put this in- on Facebook or you're fucked.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:53:43",@'
And it's like, ho- that's fuckin' stupid.
Right...?
And so, when I make these audio recordings where I talk at length about all of
these different subjects, and I tape it together into a single, cohesive package...
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:53:55",@'
I realize that some people are gonna continue to pretend like they're NOT listenin', 
even when they are.
'@)

$File.X(0,"01:54:06",@'
End recording.
