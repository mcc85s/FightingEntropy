# Foreword about evidence
In todays world, **EVIDENCE** is <u>pretty easy</u> to:
<ul>
  <li>1) collect</li>
  <li>2) review</li>
  <li>3) do stuff with</li>
</ul>

Unless of course, you happen to be a:

| # | Role                                                | For example...         |
|:--|:----------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------|
| 1 | **New York State (Trooper/Sergeant)**               | Sgt. Bosco             |
| 2 | **Saratoga County Sheriff (Deputy/Investigator)**   | Sheriff M. Zurlo       |
| 3 | **Federal Investigator**                            | Investigator C. Murphy |
| 4 | **Harriman State Campus Crimelab Forensic Analyst** | J. Izzo                |

In **ANY** of those scenarios...?

Well, __(collecting/reviewing) evidence__ is (apparently) **ILLEGAL (and/or) DANGEROUS** for **YOU** to **DO**...<br>
...and doing so **COULD** get you **KILLED**...<br>

So...?<br>
Don't do it.<br>
Wouldn't want anybody to suddenly SNEEZE around you...<br>
...cause you just flat-out, tried to be a hero...<br>
...one that was right smack dab in the middle of the process...<br>
...of **(collecting/reviewing)** evidence.

Well, at least, you WERE doin' that...
...until SUDDENLY, one of the shadiest lookin' trollmeisters that ever lived, noticed that you were doin' that...?<br>
And that's when you heard that <i>final</i> "ah-choo"...<br>
Ya got cleaned out while they were reachin' for a Kleenex.

Nah.<br>
Nobody wants that.<br>
Not at all.

**So, don't try to be a hero or anything like that, and (collect/review) evidence...**<br>
I'm being totally serious right now.<br>
There is absolutely NO WAY AT ALL...<br>
...that I'm using reverse psychology right now.<br>
Not at all.

Oh wait...<br>
Yeah, there IS a way that I'm using reverse psychology right now, cause all that shit is pretty stupid.<br>
And, cause I'm flat-out, admitting right here and now...<br>
I'm making quite an extensive use of **REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY**.<br>
Right now.

Probably looks like I'm just casually insulting a long list of (professionals/experts), huh...?<br>
Yeah, well... not so fast there, frosted flakes...<br>
Even Tony the hyper, overzealous-son-of-a-bitch Tiger has to slow down sometimes,<br>
and pay more attention to the surrounding details (and/or) context.

# Appearances can be deceiving
Too many people jump to conclusions LONG BEFORE they're even remotely ready to reach any form of conclusion, whatsoever.<br>
It's like when the colonists called the Native Americans "Indians".

Native Americans and Indians are (2) totally different types of people...?<br>
But- some people continue to call Native Americans "Indians".<br>
It's pretty stupid, isn't it...?

# Dangers of collecting evidence
Make no mistake...<br>
**(Collecting/reviewing)** evidence is just as stupid.<br>
Perhaps even MORESO...<br>
That's why some people actually consider it **suicide**, to do such a **(dangerous/trivial)** task.<br>

But also, (apparently) it's against the law for ANYONE from the above agencies (1-4), to:

| # | Action                                                                                                        |
|:--|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | __Collect evidence__ of (cybercrimes/espionage) taking place against (a citizen/many citizens)                |
| 2 | __Investigate parties__ **SUSPECTED** of committing (cybercrimes/espionage) against (a citizen/many citizens) |
| 3 | Review the work portfolio of a citizen who DOES do these (2) things above                                     |

Now, because it is (apparently) **ILLEGAL** for **ANY** of those police officers (1-4) to perform ANY of these actions...?

You have to do what **I** do, and that is, to compile a LIST of EVIDENCE of **(cybercrimes/espionage)** taking place against (a citizen/many citizens).

Since these are things that police officers (1-4) (apparently) **CANNOT LEGALLY** <i>DO</i>...?<br>
You have to perform what's called "due-diligence" FOR them.<br>
Since they (apparently) **CANNOT LEGALLY** <i>DO</i> these things.

That's pretty stupid, right...?<br>
Well, you thought wrong.<br>
It's not stupid at all.

# Why collecting evidence is DANGEROUS
You have to be **faster** than **Goku** (fictional character from **DragonBall Z**), in order to be taken seriously by ANYBODY.

Because, if you're NOT faster than **Goku**...?<br>
Then, the ACTUAL POLICE won't mind dragging someone who was not fast enough...<br>
...through the mud...<br>
...making them look like a bonafide criminal...<br>
...who was always hell bent on being the biggest douchebag on the face of the fuckin' planet...<br>
...CPS will get involved, and write fraudulent letters of indication...<br>
...**Saratoga Hospital** will get involved, and have doctors commit medical fraud...<br>
...everybody and their mother, will TRY to get in SOMEHOW, and do something **(FRAUDULENT/ILLEGAL)**...<br>
...and **NOBODY** can actually **STOP** these things from happening.<br>
Not at all.

<h3>Q : Why can nobody stop these things from happening...?</h3>
A: Because, the people that are SUPPOSED to stop these things from happening...?

SOMETIMES, they are (CARELESS/LAZY) MORONS who don't perform ANY of the actions (1-3) above.

<h3>Q : ...really...?</h3>
A: Yeah, really.

When these things happen, it allows SOME people to be VICTIMIZED REPEATEDLY...<br>
...and then the VICTIMS are (arrested/thrown in jail) for ridiculous reasons.

And, if you don't think THAT ever happens...?

| **04/06/2021** | [Paul Pelagalli overlooking ALL of this evidence below](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J0CzI1nW5xwmWbwUVwOEMbhLUiZYEr4p) |

<h3>Q : Don't you think you were being really RUDE to a JUDGE and a LAWYER...?</h3>
A: I was INTENTIONALLY being rude, because these people were being EXTREMELY CARELESS doing this thing they refer to as their "job".

The court repeatedly sent me emails that suggested my virtual appearances were scheduled at 2PM, instead of 9AM.<br>
THEN, the "public pretender" that the court appointed to "defend" me, had these "excuses" and never "returned my calls/emails".<br>
THEN, the judge ordered me to go to a clinic I was ALREADY A PATIENT OF, to see (2) doctors that DID NOT EVEN WORK THERE.

THEN, I gave the information as to the mother of my childrens whereabouts to the "public pretender", who casually dismissed that information, and then expedited the "PUBLICATION OF SERVICE" in a "town/state" that the "mother" of my "children" hadn't "lived" in over (5) fucking years.

To be perfectly honest...?<br>
I wish that I TOO, could be paid, to be a CARELESS MORON who (says/does) things that are really fucking senseless...?<br>
But, I have higher standards than that.

Effectively what I am suggesting, is that sometimes the police (among others) are pretty fucking (CARELESS/LAZY).

When people are (CARELESS/LAZY), they don't NEED to be ACCURATE with ANYTHING that they <i>DO</i>.<br>

In fact, they can consistently be wrong on EVERY CASE THEY HANDLE...<br>
...and, they'll be REWARDED for their CONSISTENTLY CARELESS behavior(s).

If you don't think THAT ever happens...?

| Date           | Name                                                       | Description               |
|:---------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------|
| **Whenever**   | [Audit the Audit](https://www.youtube.com/@AuditTheAudit)  | Something my uncle Rick Smith should check out sometime
| **03/07/2022** | [Wrongful Convictions](https://youtu.be/kpYYdCzTpps)       | **
| **04/18/2022** | [Police Interrogations](https://youtu.be/obCNQ0xksZ4)      | **

My uncle Rick Smith was a "chef" at the Harriman State Campus Training Academy... for like, (40) years.<br>
Not (1) single time in his entire (40) years there, did he EVER detect that he made food for a slew of careless morons.<br>
Not (1) time, did he ever stop, and ask himself ``Have I like, EVER fed ANY careless morons my entire time being here...?``

Take your pick on how many times the system allows the "experts" to be rather (CARELESS/LAZY).<br>
You'll find out really quickly that the system ENCOURAGES this type of behavior, and that is why it is so rampant.

In some cases, maybe they're not THAT (CARELESS/LAZY)...?

But, that MAY just be an ILLUSION, because...<br>
...holy fuckin' shitballs rolled in hay...<br>
...sometimes they truly ARE that (CARELESS/LAZY).<br>
But- don't just take my word for it, do a little digging into the videos in those links above.

Typically the people I consistently poke fun at...?<br>
They don't really care what I think, and they'll just routinely avoid actions (1-3) above.<br>
Or, doing their job (THOROUGHLY/CAREFULLY).

In the end, who gives a shit...?<br>
Nobody does.

That's why it's totally CALLED FOR, to SCRUTINIZE these sorts of people that rest on their laurels, and don't really care about things like:
<ul>
  <li>accuracy</li>
  <li>integrity</li>
  <li>perseverence</li>
  <li>honesty</li>
  <li>wisdom</li>
  <li>fairness</li>
  <li>equality</li>
  <li>liberty</li>
  <li>freedom</li>
  <li>virtue</li>
  <li>the constitution</li>
</ul>

# Segue
Allow for me to be perfectly clear here.

Some of these following items may not APPEAR to be very telling of really anything, UNLESS...<br>
...some people consider the notion that at SOME POINT...?<br>
...I started a company that focuses on DIGITAL SECURITY, which deals exclusively with:
<ul>
  <li>network security</li>
  <li>network & hardware magistration</li>
  <li>application development</li>
  <li>virtualization</li>
</ul>

Then, AFTER I did this in October 2018...?<br>
...I started noticing some really questionable shit regarding people remotely accessing the devices and networks I was managing, as well as my smartphone.

That's when I said to myself: 
``time to start manipulating whoever is doing this, to be recorded, so I can show other people the questionable shit I'm observing``

And that's when I started:
``recording some of these (videos/audio logs) attempting to manipulate the surveilling (party/parties)``

Part of being a CIVILIAN that suspects that SPIES are COMMITTING ESPIONAGE to them...<br>
...is knowing that there are (0) people you can go to, and say ``I think someone is spying on me...``

That's the key takeaway, IF someone from a foreign intelligence service IS committing espionage to a civilian...?<br>
...there's no place you can go to report that.<br>
Not at all.

There are a number of ILLUSIONS of places you could THEORETICALLY "go", to report that...<br>
...as well as OCEANS full of people that make CARELESS ASSUMPTIONS as to whether or not those ILLUSIONS are REAL or NOT...

But, think about the sentence you JUST read.<br>
There's no place you can go to report a god damn thing about foreign intelligence services spying on a civilian in another country.<br>
At least, not without a bunch of careless morons concluding long before reviewing ANY EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER...<br>
...that perhaps the murder of (my father) ``Michael Edward Cook`` in 1995 might be the reason WHY a civilian is being spied on by a foreign intelligence agency.

You know what I mean...?<br>
A cold case spanning back to 1995 involving additional observations that official police officers get paid to investigate, but like, don't.<br>
Hm. Too many people make the assumption that the police would've already figured it out by now, if that were the case.<br>
And that is why I laugh profusely whenever I detect people who make that assumption, because of how COMEDIC that assumption truly is.

Some people are just really fuckin' stupid, and you're not ALLOWED to tell them how stupid they are, either.

Because the **NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY** should give a shit about that...<br>
(<i>but they don't, I called them multiple times in 2019</i>)

And the **FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION** should give a shit about that...<br>
(<i>but they don't, I called them multiple times in 2019/2020</i>)

Hell, even the **DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY** should give a shit about that...<br>
(<i>but I'm not gonna bother contacting them</i>)

Perhaps there are SOME people SOMEWHERE that care about the numerous CLUES I've detected...?<br>
But, they really only could be from 1 of the (4) agencies I've listed up above.<br>
Either that, or they just don't actually exist.

If I AM being spied on, or HAVE been this whole time...<br>
It wouldn't be for MONEY or INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY...<br>
...which means that it would be a CRIME OF PASSION. (<i> This is called a "MOTIVE"</i>)

# Strategies to bypass careless morons
What STRATEGIES can a CIVILIAN use, who believes they're being SPIED ON by FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES...<br>
...like for instance, (SVR/Foreign Intelligence Service for Mother Russia)...?

<ul>
  <li>psychological manipulation</li>
  <li>acting</li>
  <li>recording audio/video</li>
  <li>taking pictures</li>
  <li>writing documents</li>
  <li>uploading progress reports</li>
  <li>social engineering</li>
</ul>

Oh, maybe manipulating some morons working for mother Russia, WHILE __recording stuff__ in (video/audio) might be a solid strategy...<br>
...since the police are GENERALLY very (careless/lazy/mistake prone) and they don't know how to do that without being insulted.

Is that a consistent case...?<br>
No, it isn't.<br>
Sometimes the police <i>do</i> care a LOT about accuracy, and having integrity.

But- a lot of them fucking don't.<br>
So... consulting with the police or security agencies MAY BE A (TRIVIAL/POINTLESS) TASK.

They're typically too busy abusing national security programs such as:
<ul>
  <li>xKeyScore</li>
  <li>PRISM</li>
  <li>USA-PATRIOT Act of 2001</li>
</ul>
...to GENERATE REVENUE instead of using those programs to PROTECT PEOPLE.

THAT MEANS, in SOME cases, what I am (SAYING/DOING) in SOME of these videos/audio recordings, is IRRELEVANT and UNIMPORTANT.<br>
The CONTEXT is pretty important, but good luck trying to convince people that the CONTEXT is pretty fucking important.

What is NOT so important, are the things I may be (SAYING/DOING) in some of these (videos/audio recordings).<br>
What IS... are some truly suspicious activities that are occurring WHILE the recording is being made.

Let's recap.

| Action                                                 | Result                                                                             |
|:-------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bold (statements/rhetoric)                             | Not always important, might actually be a TACTIC or STRATEGY to MANIPULATE a "SPY" |
| Events in the environment in (videos/audio recordings) | MIGHT be pretty important, MIGHT be happening in RESPONSE to (statements/rhetoric) |

Those are the STRATEGIES that I used in many of these recordings, though to be clear...?<br>
I was initially taking a shot in the dark, until I realized that these strategies were very fucking useful after all.

In order to RECORD suspicious activities that SPIES would be doing stuff IN...?<br>
...then you have to consider the notion that I may have been ACTING.

Once you start ACTING and stuff...?<br>
Some fucking morons will mislabel you as DELUSIONAL, because they'll be too lazy to look at the CONTEXT of the OTHER EVIDENCE.<br>
That's "How America Works 101"

Not at all. It is just merely coincidental that my dead father wrote this when they coincidentally attended Hudson Valley Community College at or about the same time. As long as it just appears to be coincidental (1) time...? Then that is ALWAYS the case... that it was just a mere coincidence.

Here's me, drifting around in my 2006 Audi A4 Quattro, the reason why I was so skilled at driving around in the snow, is because I used to drive upwards of about 1500-2500 miles a week and work 7 days a week for the Hearst Corporation delivering newspapers throughout lower Saratoga County, on routes Q107, Q121, and Q122, as well as Metroland, Spinners of Albany, Mild Wally's, and I Love NY Pizza. That means I had to drive more than the actual police, on a daily basis. That means I am more experienced at driving, AND investigating, than many actual law men. Go figure.

The video feeds were not synchronized because the HDD in the Albany surveillance system was going bad. The reason I have this video is because, guess what...?

During our phone call, the call was disconnected and I began to think that there MAY have been some coincidences occurring BECAUSE of the CONTEXT of the CONVERSATIONS I was having with people. Key takeaway... CONTEXT, being PRETTY IMPORTANT, but- most people don't know how to apply what they're CURRENTLY TALKING ABOUT, as being something that a SPY might be CURRENTLY HEARING/INTERACTING WITH... and then using some program to disconnect communications equipment or phone calls. Stuff like that.

Not at all. Nothing even remotely shady or suspicious at all. None. The guy staring at me in the video, he too, exhibited no suspicious signs whatsoever. Nothing shady going on. Just, another coincidence happening to occur at an extremely convenient location, and nobody could possibly serve to gain from the LOCATION of WHERE the GOD DAMN FIBER OPTIC LINE, was severed. Not at all.

It didn't seem like much of a fuckin' stretch to me, basically... I hadn't yet found the PIECE OF EVIDENCE in Exhibit #1...? But- I had a suspicion that somebody from Nfrastructure was singling me out and having a fuckin' blast doing it. I also talked about how I called Google and told em how I had some suspicions that people at Google were doing some shady trollmeister type shit, and some people were committing ESPIONAGE/TREASON. Though, to be clear, my theories are a lot more rounded out now. At some point in the recording, someone was remotely engaging the microphone while I was making the audio recording.

|       | Note  |          |      |       | The following pictures are exhibits that are able to be seen in my book Top Deck Awareness - Not News: Chapter 4 - The Week. I started taking pictures of the Verizon fiber optic cables in the area, because I remember when I was working at Computer Answers back in 2016, and I had called Verizon to get the shop a better connection than fucking lame-ass Spectrum Business. Spectrum Business sucks ass. It's expensive and slow, Comcast isn't really any better, but the kicker is that Verizon FIOS is the same thing as Verizon Wireless, it's just that they don't HAVE to offer access to the fiber optic network that Verizon Wireless uses, and thus, they don't. What this allows, is for Verizon to make more money off of the same speed they're already offering, but then Spectrum comes along, slows the connection down SIGNIFICANTLY, and then, marks up the rate for that connection. Then, they call this process being "competitive". It's not a whole lot different than when a guy has some girl blowing him, and then he shoves her head down and calls it being "fair".

That ticket got called in by a lazy cocksucker named James Leonard, who was also involved in ticket SCSO-2020-003173 involving (Zackary Karel/1769 Route 9)... but both of these tickets were called in DAYS later. This recording occurred BEFORE that. It's like this...<br>Some of the police officers who work at the Saratoga County Sheriffs Office...?<br>They're fuckin' morons.<br>If they watch this video a few times, they'll be able to see the pieces of evidence I was attempting to exfiltrate from my device, but then suddenly WHOA, the device just stopped responding for some reason~! That's mainly because Pegasus was already deployed to my fucking Apple iPhone 8+. That's weird, right...? The police are fucking lazy...? Yep.

This list of evidence is far from complete, however, it should be worthy to note that I want it to be attached to the record:
<h1>SCSO-2020-028501</h1>
That is a ticket involving:
1) Scott Schelling
2) Jeffrey Kaplan
3) Joshua Welch

Here is my statement for that particular ticket that I told Scott Schelling, but- this lazy cocksucker failed to write any notes down...<br>
[[Top Deck Awareness - Not News](https://github.com/mcc85s/FightingEntropy/blob/main/Docs/2022_1008_TDA_Not_News.pdf)]

Particularly from chapter 4 - The Week.

To be perfectly clear...?<br>
That BOOK, covers a wide range of topics related to:
| Topic    | Description          |
|:---------|:---------------------|
| Thesis   | Fox News is not news, it is propaganda. They should change the name to Not News
| Subject  | STEM/Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, History, Politics, Psychology, Philosophy, Morality, Comedy, Commerce, Industry
| Conflict | Treason, Corruption, Censorship, Injustice, Identity Theft, Cybercrime, Antitrust, Fraud
