I have a uh- [confession] to make regarding my [mother].
My mother's goin' fuckin' [senile].

[To get their attention].

And then, [make fun of em].
So I- like, I think about it this dude, [Tim Krom].

Ya know, who fuckin' flat out said to me OOooOoOhHhHh yeah,
[my dad got involved with the wrong people],

He's a [retard] just like my mother is.
My mother's not a [retard], but she's got [brain damage].

[I'm certain of it].

And so does uh- so do [a lot of other people from that age group].

I'm startin' to notice it.

04/22/2022 | The Man Who Accidentally Killed The Most People In History | https://youtu.be/IV3dnLzthDA

That video explains why [so many people] that are of [a certain age or older], may have [brain damage].
Hint: It has to do with the fact that [gasoline] used to have [lead] in it.

[Lead] is [not good for people], because it causes [brain damage], and it also has an adverse effect
on bone density. Also, once it's in your body, it just [permanently causes damage], [year] after [year].

They used to put it in [paint].
They used to put it in [pencils].
They used to put it in [gasoline].

[Lead] is a [very bad thing] for your [health], and unfortunately, 
so are people with [brain damage], because it causes someone to have a rather [low intelligence level].

[People don't actually give a shit about how intelligent someone is].

They don't care if I can actually uh- ya know, [make (175) dollars an hour].
They don't care if my mother's gonna inter- interrupt me right in the middle of a sentence where
I say "Oh yeah, [I can make (175) dollars an hour], if not more."

What that is, is a video of [Facebook], [selectively] blocking [certain posts] that I make,
as well as using some tools that [remotely connect to my device].

Maybe it's not [Mark Zuckerberg] himself, that's doing this.
Maybe it's a [hacker group] that could be [very easily paid], by [someone] that has a 
[fat stack of cash to throw around].

These things will sound [ridiculous] to people who are [really stupid].
Such as [Dr. Glosman], [Dr. Gurbek], [Dr. Loeber], [Dr. Schnakenberg], my mother,
my neighbor [William Moak]...

It'll [sound] really ridiculous to these people, because they are not [digital security]

is [substantial evidence involved].

I'm like tryin' to [tell them what I can do].

And they're like:
[People]: Nah, you can't do [anything], dude.
          
          Because, you're a fuckin' [degenerate], [low life], [piece of shit],

          anything that you say.

          By the way, [your father]...?

But-
[People don't care].
[People don't give a flying fuck].

Nope, they want you to [shut the fuck up], and [do what you're told].
And [be obedient], because [that's what everybody else does].

Sure, so like, what I [need] to do is, uh-

[Do] the [same thing] that I've [done] like [dozens of times before],
where I [start] a [new job], and then I just fuckin' [haul ass], and I start fuckin'
[working harder than everybody], and then I [notice] that like, [someone else] is
gettin' [paid a lot more money] than I am...

I really should, just- [jump into traffic].
[Cause no one gives a shit].

And everyone is uh- I feel like uh-
Everyone thinks I'm insane, but [I'm just a hell of a lot smarter than they are].

And [that is consistently the case].

I can fuckin' walk around, for fuckin' hours [recording my train of thought],
tell em that [(4) corners of a rhomubus], as long as they're [all (90) degrees],
then that [also] equals a [square].
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:09:31","00:09:59",@'
:Yeah, a [rhombus] and a [square] are [only-] are the [same thing] in that [(1) single condition].

And then- people don't realize [I walk around with that exact sense of logic], where,
it is fuckin' [on point]. It's [so on point] that just- people [think] that I'm [insane].

They don't realize, [I'm not insane at all].

[It's so fuckin' stupid], it really is.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:09:59","00:10:37",@'
:Everybody on this fuckin' planet, probably doesn't realize that an [extinction level event]
is basically [unavoidable].

The reason why it's [unavoidable], is because- [nobody gives a shit].
Well, [some people give a shit], but- [not enough].

[I've talked in circles] trying to figure this out, and [find a way out of this predicament], 
but- I really don't think that...

[I really don't think that there's anything I can do].
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:10:37","00:11:08",@'

ya know, at some point, I'll have to fuckin' express the fact that- well, I happen to
be the [most efficient person that works here], why don't I get [paid the most]...?

And then someone'll be like:
[Someone]: Well, you fuckin', fucked up with this thing here...
           Da da da da da...

Yeah, no- what happened at uh- [Computer Answers], was that uh-

I was so fucking god damn [skilled at the job] that I [outperformed people],

And uh- my mom says:
[Mom]: Hey, you need to fuckin' [follow orders] and [do what you're told], that's it.

It's like, wow.
[You're a fuckin' idiot].
Yeah.

I'm not gonna fuckin' say "Hey ma, you're fuckin' correct about that, maybe what I need
to do, is be an obedient little bitch like everybody else. And then fuckin' bust my ass
for minimum wage, just like a bunch of other people..."

When I've already gone to fuckin' [school], and spent money out the ass for my [education],
yeah, I have the [capability] of making [thousands of dollars an hour]...

[She finds that hard to believe]. (because she's stupid)
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:11:51","00:12:19",@'
:The reason why she finds that hard to believe, is because my mother is an evil...
fucking...
cunt.

And she always will be, and I probably will be, very, very sad when I want to talk to her, 
after she passes away, but I can't. But- I've already gotten myself to the point where...

[It is futile to have any conversation with her, at all].
Because [she doesn't give a shit about what's accurate, and what isn't].

$T.X(0,"00:12:19","00:13:07",@'

No, [all the things I say make plenty of sense], to someone who actually [pays attention],
and is [intelligent], and ya know [cares about facts]...?

[Facts don't care about your feelings].
But- the fuckin' generation that my mother is from...
...[they certainly think] that [feelings matter more than facts].

I swear, that is [exactly] what it is.
[They don't care], if they have [brain damage] or not.

They will say- they don't have [brain damage].

How are you suppos- how are you able to know, if you have [brain damage]...?
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:13:07","00:13:47",@'
:...if you immediately say there's [no way] that you've got it...?
[That's a serious problem right there].

You have to be [open] to the [idea] that [something is possible].
Something sounds... [hard to believe], you can say [that].

But you [can't] say something's [impossible] when it's just [hard to believe].
Cause they're [(2) totally different terms].

[They're not the same thing].
And I'm stuck in this fuckin' position because I'm [surrounded by people]
that don't give a shit.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:13:47","00:14:38",@'
:Yeah, they- they're gonna fuckin' say that I'm like, ya know, up my own ass.

I don't know how to fuckin' uh- best apply my fuckin' talents and uh- focus, but-
What I can say, is that it's fuckin' [pointless] to try and fuckin' [argue with people].

I just have to tell em "Listen, [you're wrong], and [shut the fuck up]."
And then, [they'll try to get in a fight with me], and then-

Like, look dude, [facts don't care about your feelings]...
And then they'll try to tell me:
[Them]: Dude, I'll fuckin'- I'll give you some [feelings] to fuckin' [fact up].

Uh- [they don't care].

[Battle]. Over, and over.

[Just, runnin' right into a fuckin' brick wall].

Ya know, I could tell my mother that the [judge ordered me] to [see (2) doctors]
that [don't even work at the fuckin' place he ordered me to go to].

And when I [tell him] that...?
He's gonna [disconnect me] from the fuckin' [phone call],

04/06/21 | Family Court Appearance | https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J0CzI1nW5xwmWbwUVwOEMbhLUiZYEr4p

What this is, is a [recording] that I made of the [family court virtual appearance] where
[Honorable Justice Paul Pelagalli] had [ordered me] to [see (2) doctors]:
[+] [Dr. Berger]
[+] [Dr. Grodin]

At:
Saratoga County Mental Health
135 South Broadway
Saratoga Springs, NY 12866

But, check it out.

[I was a patient of that clinic already], which I fucking mentioned in the appearance back in
[December 2020] at or about the time that [Solorigate/2020 Federal Data Breach] occurred, and
wouldn't you know, [everyone in that virtual appearance ignored that statement I made].

Further to that point, I spoke with [Sarah Friar] and [Dr. Reilly] about the [evaluation] that
this [dipshit] ordered me to go get, and [Sarah Friar] told me:

[Sarah] : Yeah, neither [Dr. Grodin] or [Dr. Berger] even work here.
[Me]    : ...then why did the judge order me to do that...?
[Sarah] : *shakes head* I dunno.
          But, they don't work here.
          [They have their own offices outside of the clinic].
[Me]    : Weird.
[Sarah] : Yeah.
          It is rather strange that a judge at the [Saratoga County Family Court] would
          order you to see (2) specifically named doctors at a place where they do not
          even work...
[Me]    : It is, it is.
          However, I am probably the only person on earth that notices the hundreds of
          coincidental things, or even "mistakes" that important people constantly make.
[Sarah] : Yeah...?
[Me]    : Yeah.
          Some people are fuckin' morons.
[Sarah] : *sigh* Now, Michael...
          Can't go around calling people morons...
          That's really [mean].
          And rude of you to do.
[Me]    : No, I know, but...
          Ehh... whaddya gonna do? 
          Some people are fuckin' careless morons.

And then, that is when I tracked down those (2) doctors down at each of their offices,
right...? And then, I had a [verbal discussion] with [each] of them where I explained that
I had a fuckin' [court order] that [specifically named the both of them], and then I even
[emailed] a [copy] of the [order] to [each of them], and then they [both] got back to me,
and said:

[Doctor] : Yeah, the [judge] is gonna have to [write a new order].
[Me]     : Really...?
[Doctor] : Yeah dude.
           Like, I don't even work at [Saratoga County Mental Health],
           and haven't for god knows how long.
           An [actual judge] ordered you to do this...?
[Me]     : Yeah.
[Doctor] : I mean, I don't even know why I'm asking the question, I'm literally lookin'
           right at the order that you emailed me and the other doctor.
[Me]     : Yeah.
[Doctor] : Seems strange.
[Me]     : Yeah.
[Doctor] : Well, get in contact with your attorney and let them know that the order
           needs to be rewritten.
[Me]     : Ok, thank you.

And then, [that is exactly what I did]. I contacted [Sarah Schellinger], who like,
[never called me back], nor [emailed me back]... and then [boom].

[I recorded that audio recording above].
I have a [knack] for this.

[Some people] are [pretty stupid] and they [don't pay attention] to [words] when they
[come out of my mouth], or if I [type them].

In some cases, I'll make a [video] of the words I typed AND said, in order to promote the
notion that [I know very fucking clearly] that [certain specifically stated names/people]
ARE [1) seeing] and [2) hearing] the [words] I'm [saying], and that they are [pretending]
as if they're [blind] and [mute], because...

They think that their [importance level masquerades their stupidity].
But- [it doesn't].

That's what some people like [Judge Paul Pelagalli], and [Sarah Schellinger] do.

OR, let's say that people DO pay attention to words when they come out of my mouth, but- the WAY
that I said those words felt:
[+] [insulting]
[+] [degrading]
[+] [hostile]
[+] or otherwise [offensive]

Well, [that's the criteria that I manage to hit on the head every time].

Mainly because [some people are fuckin' stupid], and [they ignore me] when I [say words] in
an [agreeable way], and then when I notice that they're intentionally ignoring me, I then 
[become] rather [aggravated] by being [ignored].

That's when I [switch] to the [tactic] where I [start] to [disparage people] that are in a
[position] where they're [supposed to care] about [looking like a fuckin' moron], but-

I've found out the hard way that it doesn't really matter.

[I'm using reverse psychology here].

There [are] things you can [do] to [change] these [facts].
It's called [recording evidence] and then [saving it for a later date].

Because, [at some point in the future], there is a [chance]...
...that [someone] who is [a lot more intelligent than most other people] will come along...
...[realize] how much [sense] I've made [all along the way]...
...and then they will do [everything] in [their power] to [uproot] the [numerous mistakes]
and [problems] I've [documented] and [indicated].

Until that point, however...? There's literally [nothing] that [anybody], (except me, and the
[evidence] I [continue] to [accumulate]) can even do.

:So- ya know, uh- this dipshit at the fuckin' court, [Dennis Bruce].
He can suck a fuckin' dick for all I care, and uh- heh.

These people can indiscriminately just throw me back in jail for any fuckin' reason
they want to, they don't HAVE to follow the law. They can break the law as often as 
they fuckin' feel like it, because they don't give a shit.

That's what I think about the whole entire system here, in uh- [America].
People are fuckin' stupid.

And when I try to tell them, how things really are, they will argue with me, to the point
where, it is pointless.

So, that's why I started writing this fuckin' book because, I know god damn full well,
more than a lot of other people, and, they will try to argue with me, just like my fuckin'
mother does.

Even though I am.
Yeah, a lot of people do that.

Like, a square and a rhombus are the same thing in (1) condition.
In no other condition are they the same fuckin' thing.

But my mother will fuckin' argue with that.
She'll say:
[Mom]: No, a fuckin' square and a rhombus are never the same thing.

Even though, she never fuckin' went to college or got her degree,
or this, that and the other thing, eh- people...

Even if you catch them in a recording, and you put it online, well somebody's

My father said this, [before] he was killed...

Description : The [argument] that I had with my [mother], regarding the [numerous details]
              about the [Saratoga County Sheriffs Office] mishandling a number of incidents
              that involve [me].

              Note: this section of the audio recording is the part that justice 
              [Halfmoon Justice Joe Fodera] and [Dr. Glosman], and [Dr. Gurbek] should be
              [extremely concerned with].

              They declared me ["incompetent to stand trial"], because they are working
              overtime to [deny my constitutional rights], and also to [prevent me from
              submitting this evidence to the courtroom].

              [That is what they have been doing] in [every single court interaction]:
              [+] [07/20/2022 18:00:00]
              [+] [08/17/2022 18:00:00]
              [+] [09/21/2022 18:00:00]

              [+] [10/19/2022 18:00:00]
              [+] [11/09/2022 17:30:00]
              [+] [11/16/2022 18:00:00]
              [+] [12/21/2022 18:00:00]
              [+] [01/04/2023 18:00:00]
              [+] [01/18/2023 18:00:00]
              [+] [02/01/2023 17:30:00]
              [+] [03/01/2023 17:30:00]
              [+] [04/05/2023 17:15:00]

              And what they intend to do on [04/19/2023 17:15:00], is to [provide a court order]
              for me to be [evaluated] for an [observation period] of (72) hours, in order to:
              [downplay] the [severity] of the [evidence] that is [below].

              This process that [Joe Fodera, Michael Depresso, Dr. Gurbek and Dr. Glosman]
              are committing in [collaboration], is called:
              ["Obstruction of justice"]
              
              Primarily [sedition], and [subversion] of my [constitutional rights].
              These are the links to where people can read about what I've been experiencing.

              [Obstruction of Justice]:
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice

              [Sedition]:
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition

              [Subversion]:
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion

              Allow me to repeat myself, [Honorable Justice Joe Fodera], is committing:
              [Obstruction of Justice], [Sedition], and [Subversion] of my constitutional
              rights, and THAT is the reason why he ordered me to go see (2) doctors at
              the [Saratoga County Mental Health] that were [instructed] to [mislabel me].

              [That is a criminal act].
              And, [I can prove it with the court transcriptions].

              In this section, I [indicate] to my [mother] the [exploits] that are
              [able to be seen] in these [videos].

              02/17/22 | A Matter of National Security | https://youtu.be/e4VnZObiez8
              08/21/22 | Scribbles                     | https://youtu.be/q0twJUzef9U

              The reason why I recorded it on my [smartphone] in the [second video], is
              because I know that people will say something like:
              'You photoshopped those pictures.'
              ...if I were to [take screenshots].

              I have literally thousands of these [screenshots].
              The [video removes all aspects] of the [notion] that I am [using photoshop].

              That's why it's [important] to [show other people] that it [exists], and I can
              [scroll around], and the [exploit remains on the screen].

              That's the [magic] of [not being a dumb motherfucker], like my mother is.

That is primarily because [a lot of people] in [Saratoga County] are [highly skilled], 
at [doing stupid illegal shit] that is [really obvious] and [blatant].

They are [experts] at [doing this], over and over again, [unimpeded].

There's [nothing] that [anybody can do], because of how [extremely skilled they are]...
...at [doing stupid illegal shit].

Not at all.

I'm specifically referencing [Honorable Justice Paul Pelagalli], [Michael Depresso],
[Michael Zurlo], [James Leonard], and many others.
