I have a uh- [confession] to make regarding my [mother].
My mother's goin' fuckin' [senile].

And then, [make fun of em].
So I- like, I think about it this dude, [Tim Krom].

My mother's not a [retard], but she's got [brain damage].

[I'm certain of it].

And so does uh- so do [a lot of other people from that age group].

04/22/2022 | The Man Who Accidentally Killed The Most People In History | https://youtu.be/IV3dnLzthDA

That video explains why [so many people] that are of [a certain age or older], may have [brain damage].
Hint: It has to do with the fact that [gasoline] used to have [lead] in it.

[Lead] is [not good for people], because it causes [brain damage], and it also has an adverse effect
on bone density. Also, once it's in your body, it just [permanently causes damage], [year] after [year].

They used to put it in [paint].
They used to put it in [pencils].
They used to put it in [gasoline].

[Lead] is a [very bad thing] for your [health], and unfortunately, 
so are people with [brain damage], because it causes someone to have a rather [low intelligence level].

They don't care if I can actually uh- ya know, [make (175) dollars an hour].

What that is, is a video of [Facebook], [selectively] blocking [certain posts] that I make,
as well as using some tools that [remotely connect to my device].

Maybe it's not [Mark Zuckerberg] himself, that's doing this.
Maybe it's a [hacker group] that could be [very easily paid], by [someone] that has a 
[fat stack of cash to throw around].

These things will sound [ridiculous] to people who are [really stupid].
Such as [Dr. Glosman], [Dr. Gurbek], [Dr. Loeber], [Dr. Schnakenberg], my mother,
my neighbor [William Moak]...

It'll [sound] really ridiculous to these people, because they are not [digital security]

I'm not gonna fuckin' say "Hey ma, you're fuckin' correct about that, maybe what I need

04/06/21 | Family Court Appearance | https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J0CzI1nW5xwmWbwUVwOEMbhLUiZYEr4p

What this is, is a [recording] that I made of the [family court virtual appearance] where
[Honorable Justice Paul Pelagalli] had [ordered me] to [see (2) doctors]:
[+] [Dr. Berger]
[+] [Dr. Grodin]

At:
Saratoga County Mental Health
135 South Broadway
Saratoga Springs, NY 12866

But, check it out.

[I was a patient of that clinic already], which I fucking mentioned in the appearance back in
[December 2020] at or about the time that [Solorigate/2020 Federal Data Breach] occurred, and
wouldn't you know, [everyone in that virtual appearance ignored that statement I made].

Further to that point, I spoke with [Sarah Friar] and [Dr. Reilly] about the [evaluation] that
this [dipshit] ordered me to go get, and [Sarah Friar] told me:

[Sarah] : Yeah, neither [Dr. Grodin] or [Dr. Berger] even work here.
[Me]    : ...then why did the judge order me to do that...?
[Sarah] : *shakes head* I dunno.
          But, they don't work here.
          [They have their own offices outside of the clinic].
[Me]    : Weird.
[Sarah] : Yeah.
          It is rather strange that a judge at the [Saratoga County Family Court] would
          order you to see (2) specifically named doctors at a place where they do not
          even work...
[Me]    : It is, it is.
          However, I am probably the only person on earth that notices the hundreds of
          coincidental things, or even "mistakes" that important people constantly make.
[Sarah] : Yeah...?
[Me]    : Yeah.
          Some people are fuckin' morons.
[Sarah] : *sigh* Now, Michael...
          Can't go around calling people morons...
          That's really [mean].
          And rude of you to do.
[Me]    : No, I know, but...
          Ehh... whaddya gonna do? 
          Some people are fuckin' careless morons.

And then, that is when I tracked down those (2) doctors down at each of their offices,
right...? And then, I had a [verbal discussion] with [each] of them where I explained that
I had a fuckin' [court order] that [specifically named the both of them], and then I even
[emailed] a [copy] of the [order] to [each of them], and then they [both] got back to me,
and said:

[Doctor] : Yeah, the [judge] is gonna have to [write a new order].
[Me]     : Really...?
[Doctor] : Yeah dude.
           Like, I don't even work at [Saratoga County Mental Health],
           and haven't for god knows how long.
           An [actual judge] ordered you to do this...?
[Me]     : Yeah.
[Doctor] : I mean, I don't even know why I'm asking the question, I'm literally lookin'
           right at the order that you emailed me and the other doctor.
[Me]     : Yeah.
[Doctor] : Seems strange.
[Me]     : Yeah.
[Doctor] : Well, get in contact with your attorney and let them know that the order
           needs to be rewritten.
[Me]     : Ok, thank you.

And then, [that is exactly what I did]. I contacted [Sarah Schellinger], who like,
[never called me back], nor [emailed me back]... and then [boom].

[I recorded that audio recording above].
I have a [knack] for this.

[Some people] are [pretty stupid] and they [don't pay attention] to [words] when they
[come out of my mouth], or if I [type them].

In some cases, I'll make a [video] of the words I typed AND said, in order to promote the
notion that [I know very fucking clearly] that [certain specifically stated names/people]
ARE [1) seeing] and [2) hearing] the [words] I'm [saying], and that they are [pretending]
as if they're [blind] and [mute], because...

They think that their [importance level masquerades their stupidity].
But- [it doesn't].

That's what some people like [Judge Paul Pelagalli], and [Sarah Schellinger] do.

OR, let's say that people DO pay attention to words when they come out of my mouth, but- the WAY
that I said those words felt:
[+] [insulting]
[+] [degrading]
[+] [hostile]
[+] or otherwise [offensive]

Well, [that's the criteria that I manage to hit on the head every time].

Mainly because [some people are fuckin' stupid], and [they ignore me] when I [say words] in
an [agreeable way], and then when I notice that they're intentionally ignoring me, I then 
[become] rather [aggravated] by being [ignored].

That's when I [switch] to the [tactic] where I [start] to [disparage people] that are in a
[position] where they're [supposed to care] about [looking like a fuckin' moron], but-

I've found out the hard way that it doesn't really matter.

[I'm using reverse psychology here].

There [are] things you can [do] to [change] these [facts].
It's called [recording evidence] and then [saving it for a later date].

Because, [at some point in the future], there is a [chance]...
...that [someone] who is [a lot more intelligent than most other people] will come along...
...[realize] how much [sense] I've made [all along the way]...
...and then they will do [everything] in [their power] to [uproot] the [numerous mistakes]
and [problems] I've [documented] and [indicated].

Until that point, however...? There's literally [nothing] that [anybody], (except me, and the
[evidence] I [continue] to [accumulate]) can even do.

That's what I think about the whole entire system here, in uh- [America].
People are fuckin' stupid.

And when I try to tell them, how things really are, they will argue with me, to the point
where, it is pointless.

Like, a square and a rhombus are the same thing in (1) condition.
In no other condition are they the same fuckin' thing.

But my mother will fuckin' argue with that.
She'll say:

Even though, she never fuckin' went to college or got her degree,

My father said this, [before] he was killed...

$Doc = New-Document -Name $T.Name -Date $T.Date
$Doc.Add("Introduction",@'
In this document, I will cover the entire 16 hour, 7 minute, 45 second audio recording that
I uploaded to my [Google Drive] account on [06/28/2022] at [1:08 PM], prior to an [illegal
arrest] that the [New York State Police] made that day at:
[201D Halfmoon Circle, Halfmoon NY 12065]

An [illegal arrest], is when the [police] act on [(1) side of a story].
This is done in many cases, when it is [readily apparent] that a [perpetrator did something].

However, in this particular case, the [police] have been [building] a [level] of [prejudice]
toward [me], and [so have the people in the local government]. They have been looking for
any reason at all, to arrest me (when/where) they can, and, to [ignore all of my claims].

Some people may think I'm exaggerating.
Ok.
[Read this entire document], and [listen to the audio recording].
'@)

$Doc.Add("Backstory",@'
The [court system] is [in the process] of [rolling over] my [constititional rights].

This [audio recording] proves that my mother [lied to the police], in order to have me
arrested. The [police], as well as the [court system] and the [psychiatrists] are all 
[working together] to [prevent the audio recording] from making it into the courtroom
[in my defense].

That process is called: [obstruction of justice]

The way that they see it, is that... if too many people are involved in the charade, then
there's no way that they can all get in trouble.

[When the police fail to corroborate the other side of a story], [especially] if that
[other side of the story] has [evidence] that [contradicts] the [statement] that the
[other person made], and it can be [proven] that they [chose] to [ignore] that [evidence],
that is actually a [criminal act].

Yeah, because that is all a [violation] of [federal law]. Which, you would think that
[Joe Fodera] being a judge and everything, would know that, right...?

Well, I don't think that he's ever read the [constitution].
[I'm fucking certain of it].

This entire process, is what occurred at that aforementioned address, at that aforementioned
date. When told that I uploaded an audio recording that contradicts my mothers story to my
[Google Drive] account, in the [body camera footage] that [they recorded], they decided to
arrest me anyway, because sometimes the police are fuckin' stupid like that.

Sometimes, [they cannot help it].
They'd [prefer] to [arrest] that [person], regardless of the [existence] of the [evidence].

Because that's [a lot easier for them to do].
It's a lot like when a guy has sex with a girl, and about (3) seconds after he inserts his
penis into her vagina, he ejaculates.

That is a [metaphor] or an [analogy] for how hard the [police], [Michael Depresso], [Judge
Joe Fodera], and the [psychiatrists Dr. Glosman and Dr. Gurbek] have been working in this
specific case.

It is spot on.
[Collecting the audio recording], and allowing me to submit it into the courtroom, if it
[incriminated me], [they would not prevent that from happening at all]. The prosecutor
would already have it in her hands, and be using it against me.

However, [because it proves my innocence], they are [pretending] like I am [incompetent]
to [stand trial], which means that [my constitutional rights do not apply], nor are they
[necessary], nor are they even [needed] really.

Nah. [Constitutional rights] are fuckin' stupid in their eyes, and that's the power of the
[Halfmoon Town Court] in this specific case, as well as the [numerous fucking morons] who
work for [Saratoga County].
'@)

$Doc.Add("Breakdown",@'
In this particular audio recording, I managed to capture an argument that I was having with
my mother, where I accused her of [conspiring to murder my father], [Michael Edward Cook].

[Michael Edward Cook], my father, was murdered in (1995).
[Santa "Sammy" Cassaro], not my father, was murdered in (1996).
They both worked for the [same cab company], [OK Taxi]
They both lived in the [same neighborhood], [Turf Trailer Park]
They both worked in [Albany].
The [same radio dispatcher] was working the [night they were each killed].
They were both [shot] in the [back of the head], [execution style].

What brings up these details from (2) cases back in the mid 90's, are the [numerous]
fucking [coincidental things] that I've [observed] and [recorded] since I [started] my
[company], [Secure Digits Plus LLC] in [October 2018].

Recording those [numerous coincidental things] over the last few years, led to the 
events of [05/19/2020] -> [05/26/2020], where I walked around the town of [Clifton Park]
[taking pictures], [recording videos], and making [audio recordings].

At the tail end of that week, [I was almost murdered]. 
On [May 26th, 2020] outside of the [Computer Answers] shop that I used to manage, at:
[1602 Route 9, Clifton Park, NY 12065]

I even recorded a video of the (2) perps that were attempting to do so, and I believe
that they were involved in the [armed robbery] of [Meghan Alexander] in 
[Hillside Trailer Park] in [Stillwater] in (2011-2012).

[SCSO/Mechanicville P.D. Sean Lyons] investigated that event I believe, as it involved
my cousin [Thomas Cook], who was dating [Meghan Alexander] at that time. That is also
where [Michael Zurlo] was an [investigator], prior to becoming the [Saratoga County Sheriff]
about a year or two later, in late (2013).

Much how the (3) masked individuals held my cousin's ex-girlfriend [Meghan Alexander] at
gunpoint, and got away...? Well, the (2) guys who attempted to murder me on [05/26/2020]
outside of the [Computer Answers] shop, they got away too. Even though I recorded a video
of them, and I have pictures of them walking in front of [Spare Time] to the rear of
[Hoffman Car Wash].

I believe they're (2) of the (3) same guys, and that the official police that get paid to
investigate stuff like that, [sometimes they're pretty fuckin' lazy] to [do simple math].

Like (2 + 2 = 4).
Or like, ([DJ Thompson] + [Anthony Pirrone] = Stupid).

The way I see it is like this, [sometimes] the [police] like [Robert Missenis], the father 
of the [officer] who tased me on [06/28/2022], [Cameron Missenis]'...? 

Sometimes they work with [drug dealers], or maybe they'll even have sex with them and have
kids with them, and get married to them... and so obviously, they'll have an [arrangement]
so that their [friends/girlfriends/wives] get to [sell drugs/cut hair/paint nails] and 
[make a big profit/fellate the boyfriend] without having to worry about pesky things like
being [arrested/jailed/killed].

Nah, that shit is stupid in their eyes.

So, if you're a [guy police officer], and you meet up with a [hot female drug dealer],
then instead of arresting the hot criminal, you just have sex with them instead and ignore
everything they do that could be considered [illegal]. 

It's a win-win for the both of em. They get [immunity], AND [money], and they can [fuck],
and [commit crimes] for [one another], in the name of [love], and even in some cases, 
[marriage].

When they do this, they make it [possible] for [certain people] to [make a lot of money]
by [cornering the market], and then [any] of their [competition] gets [killed], or [jailed].

It's a [win-win] for them when the [drug dealers] and [dirty cops] are [pals/lovers].
The [dirty cops] don't arrest themselves, nor the [drug dealers]... And the [drug dealers]
sell [a lot more drugs] to [a lot more people], and they (pay off/fellate) the [dirty cops].

Not unlike how [Bruce Tanski] will be friends with the former [Town of Halfmoon Supervisor],
[Melinda Wormuth], and then have [multiple accomplices commit bank fraud], and things like
that.

It's a total win-win.
Because the way they see it, [they're the people in charge].
What they say, goes.

That's why [Honorable Justice Joe Fodera] doesn't like the [notion] of [listening] to the
[fucking audio recording that proves my innocence], and [asked] the [psychiatrists] to
[write] the [fudged up] rushed evaluations that they did. Wow.

Whether the cops have some [dirty officers] in their midst, or the judges have some 
[dirty judges] in their midst, do you really expect them to give a shit about people's
[constitutional rights]...? Fuck no.

They don't have to [arrest themselves] nor [incriminate themselves].
They're the best there is.
No need to worry about pesky shit like [being arrested], [goin' to jail], or nothin'.

Plus, [lots of money to go around].
Everybody they like gets taken care of, except people that they [don't like].
Like, me. My rights are violated, and [Dr. Gurbek] and [Dr. Glosman] made certain that
is the case, because I'm pretty sure they've never read the [constitution] before, and
[they probably should at some point]. 

That's the power of [police officers] working with [drug dealers].
Or [judges] asking a [couple] of [dirty psychiatrists] to [rush] a [diagnosis] or 
[evaluation] that [contradicts] the [evaluation] that [Samuel Bastian] gave me beforehand,
back in [09/2021]. If they were tryin' to do this [inconspicuously], well they fucking 
[failed miserably].

It's like this.
[A guy on their own fucking team], spent [3+ hours] talking to me and [evaluating me].
They spent a maximum of (7-10) minutes.
That's why I raise the (premature ejaculation) analogy.

Now, here's [why] the doctors [Joe Fodera] sent me to, should consider a line of work
that [better suits them]...
'@)

$Doc.Add("Genius Intellect",@'
Sometimes, what happens is that a (10 year old boy) has his [father murdered] by these
[drug dealers] that work with the [police officers], whether it's in [Albany], or it's in
[Halfmoon]...

Maybe even [police officers], [drug dealers], and [Russian (spies/mafia)], and you cannot
expect [Dr. Gurbek], [Dr. Glosman], or [<insert whoever>] to collect evidence like I have.

Sometimes these [friendly relationships] of theirs is [wicked obvious] to people who aren't
[fuckin' stupid], such as my father [Michael Edward Cook], and [Sammy Santa Cassaro].

Sometimes, the [judges themselves] may be [involved] in this [charade].

Much how like [Francine Vero] was a [key witness] in the [trial] for the [murder] of 
[Sammy Santa Cassaro] in (1998-1999) when she was (18) years old, and it was [her testimony]
that suggested that [Melissa Davis] is the person who murdered him, not [Kristian Hansen]...?

...somehow this lady just landed a [slam dunk testimony] that led to someone being [convicted].

I think it really just comes down to [someone's appearance].
That's it.
So you COULD be [(1) hot ass bitch] that just so happens to be a [spy] from another country,
working with the [Russian Mafia], [drug dealers], [dirty police officers], and whatever, and
[nobody will ever be able to stop you].

Why...?
Because her appearance causes her to be a lot more important than anybody who isn't as hot.
Nah.

You could literally go around saying "I'm literally a Russian spy, I fuck drug dealers, 
I work with dirty cops, and I even tell em what to do, and... nobody gives a shit."

And you'd be right.
Well, I'm sure that some people would give a shit, but then you just send in [Dr. Glosman]
and [Dr. Gurbek] to label that person as incompetent to stand trial, and then holy shit.

If people are willing to entertain the notion that I'm making extreme exaggerations there,
then allow me to proceed with some shit that's [far more realistic] than the bullshit
evaluation that I received on [02/23/2023] at [135 South Broadway, Saratoga Springs NY 12086].

Wanna know what happened back in (2019)...?
Well...
I met [Honorable Justice Francine Vero] in the lawsuit between [Computer Answers] and
[Precision Periodontics] in [Saratoga Springs].

Does that automatically mean that she's an evil, shady trollmeister 5000...?
No... it doesn't.

Wanna know what happened between (2018-2020)...?
Well...
1) the network at [Computer Answers, 1602 Route 9, Clifton Park NY 12065] was attacked by
   a nasty cyberattack that involved [CVE-2019-8936], as well as a [ransomware attack] on
   [01/15/2019].
2) [Nfrastructure] sold [Computer Answers] the [Cisco Aironet 1142DN] access point that I
   flashed and reconfigured in (May 2018), and it still had my configuration on it when
   the (2) perps attempted to murder me outside of [Computer Answers].
3) I found an appointment card that links my father [Michael Edward Cook] to [Jesse Pickett].

The (2) perps that attempted to murder me may be (2) of the (3) perps that robbed [Meghan
Alexander] in [Hillside Trailer Park] ion (2011-2012), but- the ONLY WAY in which ANYONE will
ever DO anything about that, or investigate it, is if [Honorable Justice Francine Vero] agrees
with me, [without having a shred of evidence].

Yeah, [me], having [a lot of supporting evidence]...?
That shit is [stupid], and [annoying].

But- the very moment that [Francine Vero] says:
[Vero]: Ya know, I think (2) guys did actually try to kill [Michael Cook]...
        The way he's sayin' it, it's GOTTA be true...
        He's got so much of this fuckin' evidence, or whatever.
        You guys oughtta look into it.

That's the [exact moment] where the [police] will [immediately] be like:
[Cops]: HOLY SHIT, REALLY...?

And then they'll actually do whatever the hell she says.
With no evidence.
Just, words, and the raising of a single eyebrow.
Practically eviscerating opponents left and right, with (1) god damn eyebrow.

It's not like it's a bad looking eyebrow or anything, either.
Nah.
It just so happens to be the most beautiful eyebrow that anyone ever had.
In the history of mankind.
And every single police officer, will immediately drop whatever they're doing...
...and do what the hell she says.

Wanna know why...?
It's because [some of the police are pretty fuckin' stupid].
That's why.

The (2) perps that attempted to kill me are former customers of [Computer Answers].
I've mentioned this in numerous documents that I've written, but you'd be amazed as to
how fuckin' stupid so many people are, such as [my mother].

At the tail end of that murder attempt, [Scott Schelling] was the first on scene at
[1780 US 9, Zappone] along with [Joshua Welch], and [Jeffrey Kaplan].

The call for service was [SCSO-2020-028501].
The details in that report are inaccurate, because [Joshua Welch] showed up [last].
[Scott Schelling] arrived on scene [first].

When he did, I handed him my [Apple iPhone 8+] which had the video of the (2) perps
attempting to murder me, prior to that recorded incident, but my [device] was [dead].

[Scott Schelling] refused to let me [charge my device] to [show him the evidence],
before [attempting to arrest me].

I later ran into [NYSP Seamus Leavey] at [LaQuinta Inn], as well as [Stonecrest Drive].
[NYSP Seamus Leavey] is also a former customer of [Computer Answers], and I have serviced
his machine before.

I showed the very beginning of video of the (2) perps attempting to murder me, using a
software tool to remotely access my smartphone in front of the [Catricala Funeral Home],
to [NYSP Shaemus Leavey] on [05/27/2020 ~0900], hours before [SCSO James Leonard]
processed [SCSO-2020-003173 @1212] and [SCSO-2020-003177 @1414].

Ever since then, the [Saratoga County Sheriffs Office] have had a lot of officers
act like I'm [delusional]. But, I have evidence that also contradicts [Eric Catricala]'s
statement that he made on [05/27/2020] to [Scott Carpenter], regarding the events that
occurred on [05/25/2020 1145], not [05/24/2020 1510] when he and I spoke about [Dwayne
Coonradt] installing [hacked software] on [customer computers] at [Computer Answers],
and charging the [full retail price] for that [stolen software]...

...as well as how [Bruce Tanski] was investigated by the FBI over [bank fraud]...
...with [Peter Amato]...
...and [Justice Joe Fodera]'s former coworker [Melinda Wormuth]...
...who is my former lawyer [Kevin Tollisen]'s predecessor.

[Eric Catricala] failed to say these things in the statement he made to the
[Saratoga County Sheriffs Office] on [05/27/2020] about an incident that occurred on
[05/24/2020]. Wanna know why...? It's because [James Leonard] is a [crooked cop].

As for my mother, I tried to talk to her about [all] of these details, repeatedly,
but [she is pretty stupid]. So are my neighbors, [William Moak], and [Janet Moak].

However, I came to the realization that perhaps there is more than just mere stupidity
going on in my mothers head, in reference to my father's murder, as well as her
indifference in the story I kept telling her since [05/26/2020].

I had an [altercation] with [Silfredo Vasquez] because he [installed] a [security system]
in my [mothers' house], and asked me to help him get it [connected] to the [wireless
network].

I started [arguing] with my [mother], and then [Silfredo Vasquez] began to [defend her].

I told him that [my mother] ignores [all] of the [leads] and [clues] I've been collecting
over the last few years since I started my company.

Some of those [leads] and [clues] include [strange coincidental things], like:
 1) [Tom McCabe] owns [Capital Digitronics], they provide [radio communications] for the 
    [NYSP], and their radio is on [Willard Mountain].
 2) The people that live at [203D Halfmoon Circle] work for [Capital Digitronics].
 3) They moved in after [Pavel Zaichenko] was investigated by the [Department of Labor]
    in (2017), when I managed the company [Computer Answers].
 4) My mother and [Bill Moak] think that ALL they do, is [service medical equipment].
 5) [Tom McCabe] himself, drives around in a white [Mercedes Benz] with a license plate that
    says [NYS/CAPDIG1], and he himself said "We provide communications for the NYSP."
 6) The reason why my mother argues with me a lot, is because [she's pretty stupid].
 7) So are [William Moak], [Janet Moak], and [Michael H. Streeter].
 8) My father had some association with [Jesse Pickett] in (1989) at [Hudson Valley].
 9) [Jesse Pickett] and [Daniel Pickett] owned the [Nfrastructure Corporation].
10) I was once employed by the [Nfrastructure Corporation] in (2011).
11) Neither my mother, nor myself, knew that my father and [Jesse Pickett] had some
    association with my father.
12) [Honorable Justice Francine Vero] was a [key witness] in the murder trial for 
    [Santa "Sammy" Cassaro], and all she had to do was [say]:
    [Melissa Davis] is the person who murdered him, not [Kristian Hansen].

----- ----- -------- ----
0     MCCS  00:00:00 [June 27th, 2022]. [Michael Cook] speaking.
                     
                     I have a uh- [confession] to make regarding my [mother].
                     My mother's goin' fuckin' [senile].
                     
                     And uh- I realize [I'm surrounded by people that don't really care
                     about the truth].
                     
                     I think the people that [do] care about the [truth]...?
                     Piloting this [drone] the other night.

1     MCCS  00:01:20 I'm gonna fuckin' walk up to-
                     [Formal extension].

2     MCCS  00:01:50 I don't know why the hell I'm recording this, because it's [pointless] to
                     say what's on my mind. I know this fuckin' [robot drone] exists, because
                     I fuckin'...

3     MCCS  00:02:10 I fuckin' miss my [dad].

4     MCCS  00:02:34 Ya know, some people ask me some uh- questions about fuckin' 
                     [Bruce Tanski],and uh- [John Hoffman], right...?
                     
                     Well, first off, [nobody's gonna ask me] a fuckin' [god damn thing].
                     So I have to [confront them].
                     Fuckin' ask [them] questions.

5     MCCS  00:03:19 Ya know, I think the [reason] why I have to like, [insult people] and
                     fuckin' [call em out], is because, I'm smarter than their asses, and, 
                     I have to really [roast people]. 
                     
                     [To get their attention].
                     
                     And then, [make fun of em].
                     So I- like, I think about it this dude, [Tim Krom].
                     
                     Ya know, who fuckin' flat out said to me OOooOoOhHhHh yeah,
                     [my dad got involved with the wrong people],
                     and that [he owed people money for drugs], and [that's why he got killed].

6     MCCS  00:03:45 But no, [that dude is a dumbass son of a bitch to say that].
                     He's a fuckin' [retard], actually.
                     
                     He's a [retard] just like my mother is.
                     My mother's not a [retard], but she's got [brain damage].
                     
                     [I'm certain of it].
                     
                     And so does uh- so do [a lot of other people from that age group].
                     
                     I'm startin' to notice it.
                     So like...

    4/22/2022 | The Man Who Accidentally Killed The Most People In History
    https://youtu.be/IV3dnLzthDA
    
    That video explains why [so many people] that are of [a certain age or older], may have 
    [brain damage].
    
    Hint: It has to do with the fact that [gasoline] used to have [lead] in it.
    
    [Lead] is [not good for people], because it causes [brain damage], and it also has an
    adverse effect on bone density. Also, once it's in your body, it just [permanently 
    causes damage], [year] after [year].
    
    They used to put it in [paint].
    They used to put it in [pencils].
    They used to put it in [gasoline].
    
    [Lead] is a [very bad thing] for your [health], and unfortunately, so are people with 
    [brain damage], because it causes someone to have a rather [low intelligence level].

====================================================================================================================

8     MCCS  00:04:15 I think people just like to be [respected], but they don't realize that 
                     uh-
                     A lot of people seem to think that [respect] is a [two-way street].
                     Er, a [one-way street].
                     
                     And uh... 
                     I really don't wanna end up in uh- [jail] or [prison].
                     Nor have to like, fuckin' uh- have a-
                     
                     ...somebody's uh- [pain and suffering] on my [conscience] or me, ya know,
                     [getting hurt or killed].

9     MCCS  00:04:52 I think that's the thing, heh.
                     I think [Fred] just uh- [earned my respect], because...
                     
                     I know what he's thinkin', he's thinkin' a lot like so many other people.
                     [People don't actually give a shit about how intelligent someone is].
                     
                     They don't care if I can actually uh- ya know, [make (175) dollars an hour].
                     They don't care if my mother's gonna inter- interrupt me right in the
                     middle of a sentence where I say "Oh yeah, [I can make (175) dollars an
                     hour], if not more."

10    MCCS  00:05:31 The reason I'm not doing that is because my [reputation] has been
                     [damaged] to the point where someone has made it [next to impossible] for
                     me to [succeed] at [anything], and they've done such a convincingly well
                     job, that I am [stuck in this position] because a [billionaire] put me in
                     this.
                     
                     That billionaire, is [Mark Zuckerberg].
                     And probably, [John Pickett].

11    TXT   00:06:06 ===============================================================================================

    What that is, is a video of [Facebook], [selectively] blocking [certain posts] that I make,
    as well as using some tools that [remotely connect to my device].
    
    Maybe it's not [Mark Zuckerberg] himself, that's doing this.
    Maybe it's a [hacker group] that could be [very easily paid], by [someone] that has a 
    [fat stack of cash to throw around].
    
    These things will sound [ridiculous] to people who are [really stupid].
    Such as [Dr. Glosman], [Dr. Gurbek], [Dr. Loeber], [Dr. Schnakenberg], my mother,
    my neighbor [William Moak]...
    
    It'll [sound] really ridiculous to these people, because they are not [digital security]
    experts. There's just doctors that get [paid] to [selectively forfeit cases] where there
    is [substantial evidence involved]. 

====================================================================================================================

12    MCCS  00:06:06 All these people, they're gettin' mad at me, but-
                     Ya know, I know for a fuckin' fact that [Bruce Tanski]'s doin' uh- 
                     committing [bank fraud].

14    MCCS  00:06:15 And then, ya know, people are like:
                     [People]: Oh well, if he's gonna fuckin' commit [bank fraud], then what
                     can ya do, or whatever...?
                     
                     I'm like tryin' to [tell them what I can do].
                     
                     And they're like:
                     [People]: Nah, you can't do [anything], dude.
                               
                               Because, you're a fuckin' [degenerate], [low life], [piece of
                               shit], and ya know, your own god damn mother's too fuckin'
                               stupid to agree with anything that you say.
                               
                               And that, you have to [respect your mother],
                               [no matter how many times she insults you],
                               and [makes you feel totally useless].
                     
                               By the way, [your father]...?
                               He like, [scored perfectly on his ASVABS], and your [father]
                               was a [genius]. And your [father] told a [bunch of people],
                               that he was [worried] about [being killed].
                     
                     And everybody fuckin' [laughed] at this [genius], because...

15    MCCS  00:07:00 [That is how fucked up this world is].
                     
                     Is that- [someone] that [knows] what the [hell] they're [talking about],
                     that [they] can fuckin' [prove] that they [know] what they're [talking
                     about].
                     
                     But-
                     [People don't care].
                     [People don't give a flying fuck].
                     
                     Nope, they want you to [shut the fuck up], and [do what you're told].
                     And [be obedient], because [that's what everybody else does].
                     
                     Sure, so like, what I [need] to do is, uh-
                     
                     [Do] the [same thing] that I've [done] like [dozens of times before],
                     where I [start] a [new job], and then I just fuckin' [haul ass], and I
                     start fuckin' [working harder than everybody], and then I [notice] that
                     like, [someone else] is gettin' [paid a lot more money] than I am...
                     
                     But- [I'm doing more work].
                     That's what [these people] don't seem to [understand]...
                     ...is that they think I'm [bullshitting] them...

16    MCCS  00:07:58 And that's- I think that's the part where they're fuckin' [brain dead], 
                     or [something].
                     
                     It's like, I can go work with this dude, like I did back in fuckin'
                     whatever. [I'm not afraid to work].
                     
                     People seem to think that's what it is.
                     No.
                     
                     And I have lost my fuckin' cool because, [people really are fuckin'
                     stupid], man.

17    MCCS  00:08:40 Yeah, I'm not goin' over there.
                     Yeah, I have a- 
                     
                     I really should, just- [jump into traffic].
                     [Cause no one gives a shit].
                     
                     And everyone is uh- I feel like uh-
                     Everyone thinks I'm insane, but [I'm just a hell of a lot smarter than
                     they are].
                     
                     And [that is consistently the case].
                     
                     I can fuckin' walk around, for fuckin' hours [recording my train of
                     thought], tell em that [(4) corners of a rhomubus], as long as they're
                     [all (90) degrees], then that [also] equals a [square].

18    MCCS  00:09:31 Yeah, a [rhombus] and a [square] are [only-] are the [same thing] in that
                     [(1) single condition].
                     
                     And then- people don't realize [I walk around with that exact sense of
                     logic], where, it is fuckin' [on point]. It's [so on point] that just-
                     people [think] that I'm [insane].
                     
                     They don't realize, [I'm not insane at all].
                     
                     [It's so fuckin' stupid], it really is.

19    MCCS  00:09:59 Everybody on this fuckin' planet, probably doesn't realize that an
                     [extinction level event] is basically [unavoidable].
                     
                     The reason why it's [unavoidable], is because- [nobody gives a shit].
                     Well, [some people give a shit], but- [not enough].
                     
                     [I've talked in circles] trying to figure this out, and [find a way out
                     of this predicament], but- I really don't think that...
                     
                     [I really don't think that there's anything I can do].

20    MCCS  00:10:37 There's plenty I can do, to like uh- fuckin' go uh- do some [bitch work],
                     and then uh- ya know, at some point, I'll have to fuckin' express the
                     fact that- well, I happen to be the [most efficient person that works
                     here], why don't I get [paid the most]...?
                     
                     And then someone'll be like:
                     [Someone]: Well, you fuckin', fucked up with this thing here...
                                Da da da da da...
                     
                     Yeah, no- what happened at uh- [Computer Answers], was that uh-
                     
                     I was so fucking god damn [skilled at the job] that I [outperformed
                     people], like on the [first] or [second time] that I went to [go do
                     jobs].

21    MCCS  00:11:08 And then, like, the [owner] got fuckin' [jealous].
                     And uh- my mom says:
                     [Mom]: Hey, you need to fuckin' [follow orders] and [do what you're
                            told], that's it.
                     
                     It's like, wow.
                     [You're a fuckin' idiot].
                     Yeah.
                     
                     I'm not gonna fuckin' say "Hey ma, you're fuckin' correct about that,
                     maybe what I need to do, is be an obedient little bitch like everybody
                     else. And then fuckin' bust my ass for minimum wage, just like a bunch
                     of other people..."
                     
                     When I've already gone to fuckin' [school], and spent money out the ass
                     for my [education], yeah, I have the [capability] of making [thousands
                     of dollars an hour]...
                     
                     [She doesn't give a shit].
                     [She finds that hard to believe]. (because she's stupid)

22    MCCS  00:11:51 The reason why she finds that hard to believe, is because my mother is
                     an evil...
                     fucking...
                     cunt.
                     
                     And she always will be, and I probably will be, very, very sad when I
                     want to talk to her, after she passes away, but I can't. But- I've
                     already gotten myself to the point where...
                     
                     [It is futile to have any conversation with her, at all].
                     Because [she doesn't give a shit about what's accurate, and what isn't].

23    MCCS  00:12:19 So now, uh- I'm just this fuckin' supposedly, people think I'm this
                     unhinged lunatic, right...?
                     
                     No, [all the things I say make plenty of sense], to someone who
                     actually [pays attention], and is [intelligent], and ya know [cares
                     about facts]...?
                     
                     [Facts don't care about your feelings].
                     But- the fuckin' generation that my mother is from...
                     ...[they certainly think] that [feelings matter more than facts].
                     
                     I swear, that is [exactly] what it is.
                     [They don't care], if they have [brain damage] or not.
                     
                     They will say- they don't have [brain damage].
                     
                     How are you suppos- how are you able to know, if you have [brain
                     damage]...?

24    MCCS  00:13:07 ...if you immediately say there's [no way] that you've got it...?
                     [That's a serious problem right there].
                     
                     You have to be [open] to the [idea] that [something is possible].
                     Something sounds... [hard to believe], you can say [that].
                     
                     But you [can't] say something's [impossible] when it's just [hard to
                     believe]. Cause they're [(2) totally different terms].
                     
                     [They're not the same thing].
                     And I'm stuck in this fuckin' position because I'm [surrounded by people]
                     that don't give a shit.

25    MCCS  00:13:47 Yeah, they- they're gonna fuckin' say that I'm like, ya know, up my own
                     ass.
                     
                     I don't know how to fuckin' uh- best apply my fuckin' talents and uh-
                     focus, but- What I can say, is that it's fuckin' [pointless] to try and
                     fuckin' [argue with people].
                     
                     I just have to tell em "Listen, [you're wrong], and [shut the fuck up]."
                     And then, [they'll try to get in a fight with me], and then-
                     
                     Like, look dude, [facts don't care about your feelings]...
                     And then they'll try to tell me:
                     [Them]: Dude, I'll fuckin'- I'll give you some [feelings] to fuckin'
                     [fact up].
                     
                     Uh- [they don't care].
                     What [they] think, is that [their feelings matter more than the facts].

26    MCCS  00:14:38 [That's why this fuckin' planet is fucked].
                     
                     And [nobody] gives a flying fuck.
                     
                     There are [plenty of people that do], but- I'm fighting a [futile].
                     [Fucking].
                     [Battle]. Over, and over.
                     
                     [Just, runnin' right into a fuckin' brick wall].
                     
                     Ya know, I could tell my mother that the [judge ordered me] to [see (2)
                     doctors] that [don't even work at the fuckin' place he ordered me to go
                     to].
                     
                     And when I [tell him] that...?
                     He's gonna [disconnect me] from the fuckin' [phone call],
                     and then [sentence me to (20) fuckin' days in jail].

27    TXT   00:15:15 ===============================================================================================

    4/06/21 | Family Court Appearance
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J0CzI1nW5xwmWbwUVwOEMbhLUiZYEr4p
    
    What this is, is a [recording] that I made of the [family court virtual appearance] where
    [Honorable Justice Paul Pelagalli] had [ordered me] to [see (2) doctors]:
    [+] [Dr. Berger]
    [+] [Dr. Grodin]
    
    At:
    Saratoga County Mental Health
    135 South Broadway
    Saratoga Springs, NY 12866
    
    But, check it out.
    
    [I was a patient of that clinic already], which I fucking mentioned in the appearance
    back in [December 2020] at or about the time that [Solorigate/2020 Federal Data Breach]
    occurred, and wouldn't you know, [everyone in that virtual appearance ignored that
    statement I made].
    
    Further to that point, I spoke with [Sarah Friar] and [Dr. Reilly] about the [evaluation]
    that this [dipshit] ordered me to go get, and [Sarah Friar] told me:
    
    [Sarah] : Yeah, neither [Dr. Grodin] or [Dr. Berger] even work here.
    [Me]    : ...then why did the judge order me to do that...?
    [Sarah] : *shakes head* I dunno.
              But, they don't work here.
              [They have their own offices outside of the clinic].
    [Me]    : Weird.
    [Sarah] : Yeah.
              It is rather strange that a judge at the [Saratoga County Family Court] would
              order you to see (2) specifically named doctors at a place where they do not
              even work...
    [Me]    : It is, it is.
              However, I am probably the only person on earth that notices the hundreds of
              coincidental things, or even "mistakes" that important people constantly make.
    [Sarah] : Yeah...?
    [Me]    : Yeah.
              Some people are fuckin' morons.
    [Sarah] : *sigh* Now, Michael...
              Can't go around calling people morons...
              That's really [mean].
              And rude of you to do.
    [Me]    : No, I know, but...
              Ehh... whaddya gonna do? 
              Some people are fuckin' careless morons.
    
    And then, that is when I tracked down those (2) doctors down at each of their offices,
    right...? And then, I had a [verbal discussion] with [each] of them where I explained
    that I had a fuckin' [court order] that [specifically named the both of them], and then
    I even [emailed] a [copy] of the [order] to [each of them], and then they [both] got
    back to me, and said:
    
    [Doctor] : Yeah, the [judge] is gonna have to [write a new order].
    [Me]     : Really...?
    [Doctor] : Yeah dude.
               Like, I don't even work at [Saratoga County Mental Health],
               and haven't for god knows how long.
               An [actual judge] ordered you to do this...?
    [Me]     : Yeah.
    [Doctor] : I mean, I don't even know why I'm asking the question, I'm literally lookin'
               right at the order that you emailed me and the other doctor.
    [Me]     : Yeah.
    [Doctor] : Seems strange.
    [Me]     : Yeah.
    [Doctor] : Well, get in contact with your attorney and let them know that the order
               needs to be rewritten.
    [Me]     : Ok, thank you.
    
    And then, [that is exactly what I did]. I contacted [Sarah Schellinger], who like,
    [never called me back], nor [emailed me back]... and then [boom].
    
    [I recorded that audio recording above].
    I have a [knack] for this.
    
    [Some people] are [pretty stupid] and they [don't pay attention] to [words] when they
    [come out of my mouth], or if I [type them].
    
    In some cases, I'll make a [video] of the words I typed AND said, in order to promote the
    notion that [I know very fucking clearly] that [certain specifically stated names/people]
    ARE [1) seeing] and [2) hearing] the [words] I'm [saying], and that they are [pretending]
    as if they're [blind] and [mute], because...
    
    They think that their [importance level masquerades their stupidity].
    But- [it doesn't].
    
    That's what some people like [Judge Paul Pelagalli], and [Sarah Schellinger] do.
    
    OR, let's say that people DO pay attention to words when they come out of my mouth, but-
    the WAY that I said those words felt:
    [+] [insulting]
    [+] [degrading]
    [+] [hostile]
    [+] or otherwise [offensive]
    
    Well, [that's the criteria that I manage to hit on the head every time].
    
    Mainly because [some people are fuckin' stupid], and [they ignore me] when I [say words]
    in an [agreeable way], and then when I notice that they're intentionally ignoring me, I
    then [become] rather [aggravated] by being [ignored].
    
    That's when I [switch] to the [tactic] where I [start] to [disparage people] that are in
    a [position] where they're [supposed to care] about [looking like a fuckin' moron], but-
    
    I've found out the hard way that it doesn't really matter.
    
    [I'm using reverse psychology here].
    
    There [are] things you can [do] to [change] these [facts].
    It's called [recording evidence] and then [saving it for a later date].
    
    Because, [at some point in the future], there is a [chance]...
    ...that [someone] who is [a lot more intelligent than most other people] will come along...
    ...[realize] how much [sense] I've made [all along the way]...
    ...and then they will do [everything] in [their power] to [uproot] the [numerous mistakes]
    and [problems] I've [documented] and [indicated].
    
    Until that point, however...? There's literally [nothing] that [anybody], (except me,
    and the [evidence] I [continue] to [accumulate]) can even do.

====================================================================================================================

28    MCCS  00:15:15 So- ya know, uh- this dipshit at the fuckin' court, [Dennis Bruce].
                     He can suck a fuckin' dick for all I care, and uh- heh.
                     
                     These people can indiscriminately just throw me back in jail for any
                     fuckin' reason they want to, they don't HAVE to follow the law. They can
                     break the law as often as they fuckin' feel like it, because they don't
                     give a shit.
                     
                     That's what I think about the whole entire system here, in uh- [America].
                     People are fuckin' stupid.
                     
                     And when I try to tell them, how things really are, they will argue with
                     me, to the point where, it is pointless.
                     
                     So, that's why I started writing this fuckin' book because, I know god
                     damn full well, more than a lot of other people, and, they will try to
                     argue with me, just like my fuckin' mother does.

29    MCCS  00:16:10 So I've realized that the ol', the entire point, of me existing, was to
                     be born, and then... try to be- be correct all the time...? But- be told
                     by people that I'm NOT correct. 
                     
                     Even though I am.
                     Yeah, a lot of people do that.
                     
                     Like, a square and a rhombus are the same thing in (1) condition.
                     In no other condition are they the same fuckin' thing.
                     
                     But my mother will fuckin' argue with that.
                     She'll say:
                     [Mom]: No, a fuckin' square and a rhombus are never the same thing.
                     
                     Even though, she never fuckin' went to college or got her degree,
                     or this, that and the other thing, eh- people...
                     
                     Wanna be re- they tell me to respect my mother, when she fuckin' insults
                     me every fuckin' day. She also got my father fuckin' killed.

30    MCCS  00:17:12 And then people give me useless suggestions, whether it's the
                     [Saratoga County Sheriffs Office], ya know, people from [Saratoga County]...?
                     
                     They actually don't give a shit.
                     They just do whatever the hell they want to.
                     They don't have to be fuckin' accurate.
                     Even if you catch them in a recording, and you put it online, well
                     somebody's gonna fuckin censor that fuckin' information from being heard
                     by other people.
                     
                     And that's literally what fuckin' happens to me, and then people just
                     think that I'm being fuckin silly, or ridiculous... but- I'm not being
                     fucking ridiculous at all.
                     
                     I could s- I literally have a video that could bankrupt [Mark Zuckerberg]
                     right fuckin' now, but nobody's gonna click on it, nor care about it.

31    MCCS  00:18:00 I'm trying to use reverse psychology because I'm sure that some people
                     DO care about what was- what's in the video, but- most people aren't
                     gonna be intelligent to see what it is, or know what it is.

32    MCCS  00:18:49 Prolly never gonna fuckin' see that thing again...

33    MCCS  00:19:22 I'm basically lost.
                     I may as well already fuckin' be dead.
                     That's how it feels.
                     
                     And uh- these cocksuckers are aware of that.
                     
                     Nobody actually cares about the truth.

                     Try to tell em, someone like [Mark Zuckerberg]'s gonna prevent them
                     from knowing.

34    MCCS  00:20:08 Eh, nobody gives a shit, dude.
                     
                     My life was a fuckin' lost cause.
                     I don't know why I fuckin' tried to believe in the truth.

Description : Having a conversation with my mother about [dad] and [Sammy Cassaro].

              What she doesn't understand, is that I think that [other people] had
              my [father] murdered, as well as [Sammy Cassaro], and that those
              [same people tried to have me murdered on 05/26/2020] outside of
              [Computer Answers].

              If she DOES understand it, then some of her [body language] indicates
              that she has [something to hide].

71    MCCS  14:27:33 Can you open the door for a sec?
                     
                     Can you open the door for a second...?

72    FSKC  14:27:44 *Opens door*

73    MCCS  14:27:47 Two things I'm gonna say to you right now.
                     
                     The [reason] why the [(3) guys] [never] [named the trigger man]...?
                     
                     Because [they were keepin their mouths shut] because [a larger crime
                     was involved].
                     
                     The [larger crime] involved means that all (3) of them get to go...

74    ENV   14:28:01 *(2) taps heard on my computer*

75    MCCS  14:28:01 ...to a [new] trial...

76    ENV   14:28:02 *(2) taps heard on my computer*

77    MCCS  14:28:03 ...where they face the [same] fuckin' [charges] they [already faced]...

78    ENV   14:28:06 *(2) taps heard on my computer*

79    MCCS  14:28:06 ...and the [time served doesn't matter]... [in addition] to [**other
                     people**]. Cause, guess what...?
                     
                     That means that it's a more [heinous crime], than it [sounds] like.
                     
                     And the [clues] are [right in front of everybody's face].
                     
                     My father said this, [before] he was killed...
                     [Dad]: If those niggers come after me-
                            I'm gonna put my foot to the floor and take those niggers with 
                            me to hell.
                     
                     That means, it was [premeditated].

80    FSKC  14:28:29 He didn't say 'niggers' he said [anybody] tried to rob him.

81    MCCS  14:28:33 He said 'niggers'...*overlap* I heard him, mom.

82    MCCS  14:28:37 That- that's another thing, you've done this to me my [whole life],
                     like, when I [remember certain things] like that, you say:
                     [You]: Nah, that's wrong.
                     
                     You DO that. 
                     I remember what my dad, said.

83    FSKC  14:28:48 And then he said that around [you]...?

84    MCCS  14:28:50 He probably did, and I- I'm just sayin, I remember him [sayin'] that.

85    MCCS  14:28:54 But- y'know, I'm sure my son and my daughter bein-'

86    FSKC  14:28:58 He was stickin' up for... black fuckin' people, there.

87    MCCS  14:29:01 I [know] he was, but they were also [lookin'] for him because,
                     [**somebody**] was [**listening to my dad**], [**and the dispatcher**]
                     on the [**radio**].

88    MCCS  14:29:09 Wanna know how I [know] that...?

89    MCCS  14:29:12 Because the [same dispatcher] was involved in [Sammy]'s death,
                     and my [father]'s death.

90    FSKC  14:29:16 Cause they [both] worked for the [same company].

91    MCCS  14:29:19 Right, but- that's a [clue]. *pause* *interrupted*
                     
                     (clue: NOUN a [piece of evidence] or [information] used in the 
                            [detection] of a [crime] or [solving of a mystery])

92    FSKC  14:29:22 It wasn't just [them], there was a couple [other] cab drivers [too]
                     that got killed.

93    MCCS  14:29:26 You have to [understand the possibility], that there are [multiple 
                     reasons] and [explanations] for things.

94    MCCS  14:29:32 So, the [same dispatcher], and the [same cab company] being involved...

95    ENV   14:29:38 *(2) taps heard on my computer, followed by a [toast notification]*

96    MCCS  14:29:38 ...doesn't [necessarily mean] that there's a [larger crime] involved...?

97    MCCS  14:29:39 But what it [does] mean, is that...
98    MCCS  14:29:42 There's a [possibility] that the [(2) crimes were related] for a 
                     [higher reason] that [you're not considering].

99    MCCS  14:29:49 That's what I'm trying to tell you.
                     Because if it was a [different] cab company-

100   FSKC  14:29:52 I get it.

101   MCCS  14:29:53 ...it was a [different]... 
                     [Ok], you don't- you GET it, but you're [crossing your arms] and like, 
                     [getting **defensive** about it].

102   MCCS  14:30:00 I'm trying to [tell] you that I have actually [done] this, like a fuckin'
                     [investigator] from the [police].

103   FSKC  14:30:05 Yeah, but you're not gettin' [paid] for it.

104   MCCS  14:30:06 Doesn't [matter]- 
                     That means-
                     
                     That [doesn't] mean-

105   FSKC  14:30:08 Put your energy towards something that's gonna [result] in something...

106   MCCS  14:30:10 No, I [am] putting my [energy toward something] that's [gonna result in
                     something].

107   MCCS  14:30:14 [You're undermining me]. 
                     (dead giveaway that she may have an [ulterior motive])

                     You think, you don't realize, I have the [guy]-

108   FSKC  14:30:19 I've had enough, Mike.

109   MCCS  14:30:20 The guy who [runs] [Saratoga County Sheriffs Office]
                     TRIED, TO HAVE, ME, MURDERED, ON MAY 26th, 2020.
                     
                     (And if he didn't...? Then maybe he and I ought to have a
                     conversation about [SCSO-2020-028501])

110   FSKC  14:30:27 Then get a god damn lawyer that believes you.
111   MCCS  14:30:32 I have to like, [convince] people, like- my [mother].
112   MCCS  14:30:34 *pause*
113   MCCS  14:30:37 Because I can't [buy] a lawyer.
                     
                     Wanna know why I can't [buy] a lawyer...?

114   MCCS  14:30:41 Because I'm on a [national security watchlist], so I can't get a
                     fuckin' job.
                     
                     (I'm not certain of this, I don't think people are allowed to know.
                     But then again, I have a collection of videos that constitute as
                     pieces of supporting evidence.)

115   MCCS  14:30:44 Cause (1) asshole worked with the fuckin' police officer who [runs] 
                     Saratoga County, and [they], they didn't answer my 911 calls.
                     
                     You don't get it, there is, [(7) FELONIES OCCURRED TO ME], that night.
                     
                     And then I got [arrested] for [cutting a kayak strap].
                     
                     [Not for calling 911] because (2) kids were trying to [kill] me, and...
                     you SEEM to think I'm makin' that up.

116   FSKC  14:31:06 NO.
                     YOU'RE NOT.
                     AND I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HEARIN' IT~!

117   MCCS  14:31:10 Well, hold on.
                     Hold on.
                     Hold on.

118   FSKC  14:31:11 I'm not goin' THROUGH this crap.
119   FSKC  14:31:12 *Shuts the door*

              This process that [Joe Fodera, Michael Depresso, Dr. Gurbek and Dr. Glosman]
              are committing in [collaboration], is called:
              ["Obstruction of justice"]

              Primarily [sedition], and [subversion] of my [constitutional rights].
              These are the links to where people can read about what I've been experiencing.

              [Obstruction of Justice]:
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice

              [Sedition]:
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition

              [Subversion]:
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion

              Allow me to repeat myself, [Honorable Justice Joe Fodera], is committing:
              [Obstruction of Justice], [Sedition], and [Subversion] of my constitutional
              rights, and THAT is the reason why he ordered me to go see (2) doctors at
              the [Saratoga County Mental Health] that were [instructed] to [mislabel me].

              [That is a criminal act].
              And, [I can prove it with the court transcriptions].

              In this section, I [indicate] to my [mother] the [exploits] that are
              [able to be seen] in these [videos].

              02/17/22 | A Matter of National Security | https://youtu.be/e4VnZObiez8
              08/21/22 | Scribbles                     | https://youtu.be/q0twJUzef9U

              The reason why I recorded it on my [smartphone] in the [second video], is
              because I know that people will say something like:
              'You photoshopped those pictures.'
              ...if I were to [take screenshots].

              I have literally thousands of these [screenshots].
              The [video removes all aspects] of the [notion] that I am [using photoshop].

              That's why it's [important] to [show other people] that it [exists], and I can
              [scroll around], and the [exploit remains on the screen].

              That's the [magic] of [not being a dumb motherfucker], like my mother is.

135   MCCS  16:00:01 Hey
136   MCCS  16:00:01 *Knocks on door*
137   FSKC  16:00:03 What...?

150   MCCS  16:00:36 I'm about to show you that the [Saratoga County], fuckin' cobbled together [illegal charges].
151   TXT   16:00:47 ===============================================================================================

    That is primarily because [a lot of people] in [Saratoga County] are [highly skilled], 
    at [doing stupid illegal shit] that is [really obvious] and [blatant].
    
    They are [experts] at [doing this], over and over again, [unimpeded].
    
    There's [nothing] that [anybody can do], because of how [extremely skilled they are]...
    ...at [doing stupid illegal shit].
    
    Not at all.
    
    I'm specifically referencing [Honorable Justice Paul Pelagalli], [Michael Depresso],
    [Michael Zurlo], [James Leonard], and many others.

167   MCCS  16:01:27 See how it's [different]...?

168   FSKC  16:01:29 Yeah...?

169   MCCS  16:01:30 That's because somebody's trying to [communicate] with me.

170   MCCS  16:01:33 [This ticket] right here...
                     
    SCSO-2020-003173 1212
    https://github.com/mcc85s/FightingEntropy/tree/main/Records/SCSO-2020-003173
                     
                     ...is the, it says 'Suspect of an earlier complaint made by Zachary Karel'
                     
                     The [earlier] complaint they made was at [1414].
                     
    SCSO-2020-003177 1414
    https://github.com/mcc85s/FightingEntropy/tree/main/Records/SCSO-2020-003177
                     
                     So, they're literally writing in a fuckin' document that they arrested me
                     for, that an [earlier] complaint was made... [after], 1212.

                     Oh yeah, no, this is an earlier <complaint>
                     
                     That's what fuckin' [Saratoga County Sheriffs Office] did to me.
                     
                     An [earlier] complaint was made at 1414,
                     [that's not earlier, that's later].

171   FSKC  16:02:13 Why are you fuckin' yellin' at me...?

172   MCCS  16:02:14 Because I spent the last (2) years telling you this, and you keep thinkin' I'm INSANE~!

175   FSKC  16:02:30 You're [acting] like you're insane.

176   MCCS  16:02:32 I'm [acting] that way, because I spent the last (2) years trying to-

177   FSKC  16:02:34 Alright~! Whatever~!

178   MCCS  16:02:36 It's so important.

179   FSKC  16:02:37 Get the fuck outta my face.

181   MCCS  16:02:40 YOU don't understand-

182   FSKC  16:02:41 YOU need to get the fuck outta my face~!

183   MCCS  16:02:44 I'm not IN your face.
                     I'm asking you for help.

188   FSKC  16:02:53 Get the fuck

                     of your friends.

                     [commit murder] against my [father].

217   FSKC  16:04:14 *Tries to slam the kitchen door in my face*

218   MCCS  16:04:16 No, [I think you conspired to murder my father], now.

$Doc.Add("Conclusion",@'
That is the point at which I realized that my smartphone had recorded everything
between the audio recording that I made the night before, to that very second.

At which point, I then and there, [uploaded the audio recording].

I realize that some of MY language is pretty bad, but so are some of the things
my mother said.

Here's the startling reality.

My mother's statement that she made to [Sara Derusso], whereby allowing me to be 
[arrested], and [tased] by the [New York State Police], as well as having my name
dragged through the mud, [among various other fucking serious problems] that I now
have with the local [law enforcement] and [justice system].

My name is [Fabienne S. Cook] and I am speaking with [Trooper DeRusso] of my own free will[1].
I was in my bedroom with my door locked because my son [Michael C. Cook] was yelling at me
earlier today, that I did not understand the evidence he had that multiple people in the
trailer park were conspiring to kill him[2]. (I never indicated that at all.)

While I was laying in my room [Michael] called me into his room to show me something on his
computer[3]. [Michael] stated that the computer showed proof of the people conspiring to kill
him[4]. 

(Nah, I didn't actually. She made that part up, because she's stupid. I accused her of
conspiring my father, and she makes no mention of that in this statement.)

I told [Michael] that I did not understand and I walked out of his room because he was
starting to yell again[5].

As I tried to leave the house through the front door he slammed the door shut so I could
not get out and wrapped his right arm around my throat, putting me in a headlock[6].
(I put my hands around her wrists because she was trying to assault me.)

While he had his arm around my throat I tried to keep my chin down[7].
I began to struggle and he stated the more I fought him the tighter he would make it[8].
As I struggled, he tightened his trip, and then tried to put his leg around my leg and
bring me to the floor[9].

I continued to struggle because I knew if he got me to the floor it was going to be bad[10]. 
I told [Michael] he was hurting me and I was going to call 911[11].
(She makes no mention of wanting to call 911)

He tried to get my cell phone away from me but I kept a tight grip[12].
(Michael Depresso is pretty stupid, I don't have a third arm.)

I begged [Michael] to let me go and told him I would stop trying to get away[13].
(No she didn't.)

[Michael] loosened his grip and I was able to get out of the room[14].
As I was leaving he continued to yell at me[15].
I walked over to my neighbors house as fast as I could and called 911[16].

My neck and hip are sore from the struggle but I do not need medical assistance[17].
I would like to press charges against my son Michael for hurting me and would like an
order of protection[18].

And there ya have it.
There's a bunch of people at the Town of Halfmoon that are about as crooked as
[Bruce Tanski] and [Melinda Wormuth], and I'd like my case to be transferred to
another judge as well as to be reevaluated by [psychiatrists] that aren't going to
ignore the mountain of evidence that I have. Because, the only other alternative, would mean
resorting to the [second amendment of the constitution].

So far, a lot of people are making assumptions...
"Maybe your mother is just old and didn't really know what to say when she made her statement"
Which supports my case that she's going senile.

"Maybe you're just a scumbag and that's why she treats you the way she does."
Maybe anyone who thinks that is just fucking lazy and can't read.

"Maybe the police thought you were lying about the audio recording."
Nope, they didn't, because they arrested me as soon as I told them I uploaded it.
