# Synopsis
| Summary |
|:--------|
| I walked to [**Stratton Air National Guard**] because I had recorded multiple audio recordings of something that [**sounded**] a lot like [**an actual bird**].<br>
<br>
<br>When I was at the base, I suggested to (3) guards that I had an [**audio recording**] of something that I believed was a [**drone**].
<br>
<br>The soldiers that came to the gate were rather dubious that what I recorded was something rather advanced.
<br>They never collected the audio recording, but they did ask me for my identification, and then they told me to go to [**Washington D.C.**]
<br>
<br>I then said "Thanks a lot you guys, you're doing the country a wonderful service. Go get those bad guys. Take care."
<br>
<br>In response, [**Stratton Air National Guard**] contacted the [**Rotterdam Police Department**] because they didn't feel like contacting the [Glenville] police, nor the [Schenectady] police, which was the jurisdiction that I was actually in, at the time that this event took place. |
