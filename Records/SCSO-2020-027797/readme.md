          I walked to [<b>Stratton Air National Guard</b>] because I had [<b>recorded multiple audio recordings</b>]

        <p>
          Because they're [<b>professionals</b>].

          They would know, if the [<b>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</b>] would have a [<b>drone</b>] that
          flies around, and [<b>mimics the sound of an actual bird, or a mockingbird</b>].

          When I was at the base, I suggested to (3) guards that I had an [<b>audio recording</b>] of something 
          that I believed was a [<b>drone</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          The [<b>soldiers</b>] that [<b>came</b>] to the [<b>gate</b>] were rather [<b>dubious</b>] that what
          I [<b>recorded</b>] was [<b>something rather advanced</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          They [<b>never collected</b>] the [<b>audio recording</b>], but they [<b>did</b>] ask me for my [<b>identification</b>],
          and then they told me to go to [<b>Washington D.C.</b>]
        </p>
        <p>
          I then said:
          <i>"Thanks a lot you guys, you're doing the country a wonderful service. Go get those bad guys, and make sure you stay hydrated. Take care."</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          In response, [<b>Stratton Air National Guard</b>] contacted the [<b>Glenville Police Department</b>], who was like
          "Hey guys, let's check the area. By the way, have Saratoga County check the home for whatever reason."
          And then that is what they did.

          They couldn't find me even though I walked there on foot... Maybe it is extremely difficult to check the (1) road that they could've found me on,
          that leads to the base. About a half hour later I recorded these (2) exhibits...

          Maybe when you're a [<b>police department</b>], and you have to find ways to appear busy at 1AM, you find ways
          to [<b>pass the buck around</b>] rather than to [<b>review the evidence</b>], and so, [<b>each police station</b>]
          acts as the [<b>bumpers</b>] in a [<b>pinball machine</b>], and hopefully the ball makes its way over to a guy
          like [<b>Scott Schelling</b>], where he can perform a [<b>welfare check</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          It probably sounds fuckin' stupid, but- that is [<b>exactly</b>] how they think.

# Narrative
Here's what I actually went to [**Stratton Air National Guard**] for.

They took the [**reason**] I went there, **[out of context**].

I'm making a big deal about all of this, because [**they're making decisions**] that they believe are [**informed**].

As in, [**they would know ahead of time**], that what I'm [**attempting**] to [**show them**], is fucking [**stupid**].

And, that is the reason why things like this [**can't be prevented**]:
[2020 Federal Data Breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach)

I mean, theoretically, they probably could prevent stuff like that from happening in the future...?
But, in reality, that would require them to have to stop acting like [**careless fucking morons**].

From what I can tell, they love to do that.
They'll say it a lot too, like "Nah, I'm not a careless fucking moron."

But- [**actions speak louder than words**].
And that is [**exactly**] what this [**whole entire incident**] revolves around.

The best case I can make, is this.

[**IF**]... someone from [**another country**] like [**CHINA**] or [**RUSSIA**] is using a [**very advanced drone**] to spy on [**US Citizens**], they will only accept leads if you're [**important enough**].

If you're [**not important enough**](https://youtu.be/dU_5rdVkCD8), they're gonna do [**exactly**] what [**Stratton Air National Guard**] did in this incident.

So will [**every other police agency**](https://youtu.be/tW80Zj_H6Fw).

If you're [**not important enough**], [**Vladimir Putin**] or [**Xi Xinping**] could [**literally**] send a video of themselves writing a letter to a [**US citizen**], that says the 1) date, 2) time, and 3) location where they are going to invade the United States of America...? And, oh my god.

[**Stratton Air National Guard**] would be the [**first ones to blame**] if that [**did**] indeed happen, and they ignored the video or audio recording or whatever evidence existed.

They may think that it's a matter of [**importance**], or that I'm just some [**fuckboy**] that doesn't know what the hell I'm talking about when I say stuff, or whatever, but then check these out...

| Date       | Name            | Link                                                         |
|:-----------|:----------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `10/04/22` | God Mode Cursor | [https://youtu.be/dU_5rdVkCD8](https://youtu.be/dU_5rdVkCD8) |
| `09/26/22` | God Mode Cursor | [https://youtu.be/tW80Zj_H6Fw](https://youtu.be/tW80Zj_H6Fw) |

I mean, [**allow me to use the stupid fallacious logic that they use**], to illustrate how it's [**pretty dangerous**] to write stuff off [**immediately**], without [**investigating**] a fucking claim.

I may be the most intelligent person that ever lived, because I gotta be, in order to have (2) video links of a thing that shows up called the "god mode cursor".

Gotta be.
It couldn't possibly be the case, that I'm NOT the most intelligent person that ever
lived, otherwise, why would I have (2) of these videos as well as other videos that
show other various glitches and exploits on operating systems that have been made
by the [Microsoft Corporation]...?

You see...?
I'm using [the same sort of logic that these people use], in order to [justify my claim].

The claim is...
I GOTTA be the most intelligent person that has ever lived, in order to have (2) videos
of this glitch. And because they are already aware of the fact that I'm the most intelligent
person that ever lived, that's why they don't have to [investigate] anything that I have 
on hand, because of how jealous they are, of how intelligent I am, and that's it.

Sounds fuckin' stupid, right...?
Right.

That's the [beginning] and the [end] of my claim here.
They can't investigate a god damn thing if their hands constantly go limp, when I say
"Check out this audio recording."

However, that is [exactly] what so many people do.

I can tell them:
[Me]: HEY, CHECK OUT THIS AUDIO RECORDING...

And they'll be CONFUSED, and somehow think that I said [DRONES DISGUISED AS BIRDS].

That's how ignorant many people actually are...
...when I talk to them about stuff like this...
...on a rather consistent basis.

To make matters even more compelling...?
I was able to collect ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE THAT THEY DIDN'T REALLY TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT,
after I made it to [Schenectady].

It truly is such a RECURRING THEME...

"Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups." -George Carlin

How many dozens of ways should I slice this...? I'm not insane...
I'm just a lot more intelligent than most people. That's ALL it is.
Am I the SMARTEST DUDE THAT EVER LIVED...? Nah.
Do I go around saying "HEY, SMARTEST DUDE YOU'LL EVER MEET IN YOUR LIFE, BRO~!"
Nope. I don't do that at all.
I just say "HEY, CHECK OUT THIS EVIDENCE I HAVE OF SOMETHING REALLY STRANGE~!"
And people immediately CONFUSE what the fuck I just said, like on a constant, every-day basis.
