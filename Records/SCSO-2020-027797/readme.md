# Synopsis
| Summary |
|:--------|
| I walked to [Stratton Air National Guard] because I had recorded multiple audio recordings of something that [sounded] a lot like an actual bird. In response, [Stratton Air National Guard] contacted the [Rotterdam Police Department] because they didn't feel like contacting the [Glenville] police, nor the [Schenectady] police, which was the jurisdiction that I was actually in, at the time that this event took place. |
