          I walked to [<b>Stratton Air National Guard</b>] because I had [<b>recorded multiple audio recordings</b>] 
          of [<b>something</b>] that [<b>sounded</b>] a lot like [<b>an actual bird</b>]. They [<b>misinterpreted</b>] 
          what I [<b>said</b>], and [<b>assumed</b>] that I said [<b>drones disguised as birds</b>]. 
          Because they're [<b>professionals</b>].
          They would know, if the [<b>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</b>] would have a [<b>drone</b>] that
          flies around, and [<b>mimics the sound of an actual bird, or a mockingbird</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was at the base, I suggested to (3) guards that I had an [<b>audio recording</b>] of something
          that I believed was a [<b>drone</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          The [<b>soldiers</b>] that [<b>came</b>] to the [<b>gate</b>] were rather [<b>dubious</b>] that what 
          I [<b>recorded</b>] was [<b>something rather advanced</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          They [<b>never collected</b>] the [<b>audio recording</b>], but they [<b>did</b>] ask me for my
          [<b>identification</b>], and then they told me to go to [<b>Washington D.C.</b>]
        </p>
        <p>
          I then said:<br>
          <i>"Thanks a lot you guys, you're doing the country a wonderful service. Go get those bad guys. Take care."</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          In response, [<b>Stratton Air National Guard</b>] contacted the [<b>Rotterdam Police Department</b>]
          because they didn't feel like contacting the [<b>Glenville</b>] police, nor the [<b>Schenectady</b>] police,
          which was the [<b>jurisdiction</b>] that I was actually in, at the time that this event took place.
