# Synopsis
| Summary |
|:--------|
| <p>
  I walked to [<b>Stratton Air National Guard</b>] because I had recorded multiple audio recordings of something that [<b>sounded</b>] a lot like [<b>an actual bird</b>].
</p>
<p>
  When I was at the base, I suggested to (3) guards that I had an [<b>audio recording</b>] of something that I believed was a [<b>drone</b>].
</p>
<p>
  The soldiers that came to the gate were rather dubious that what I recorded was something rather advanced.
</p>
<p>
  They never collected the audio recording, but they did ask me for my [<b>identification</b>], and then they told me to go to [<b>Washington D.C.</b>]
</p>
<p>
  I then said:<br>
  "Thanks a lot you guys, you're doing the country a wonderful service.<br>
  Go get those bad guys.<br>
  Take care."
</p>
<p>
  In response, [<b>Stratton Air National Guard</b>] contacted the [<b>Rotterdam Police Department</b>] because they didn't feel like contacting the [<b>Glenville</b>] police, nor the [<b>Schenectady</b>] police, which was the [<b>jurisdiction</b>] that I was actually in, at the time that this event took place. |
