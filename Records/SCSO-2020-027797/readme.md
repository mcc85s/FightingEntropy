          I walked to [<b>Stratton Air National Guard</b>] because I had [<b>recorded multiple audio recordings</b>] 
          of [<b>something</b>] that [<b>sounded</b>] a lot like [<b>an actual bird</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          (1) https://drive.google.com/file/d/13NPoJyRENfdy7_kwMVCjfrJccoU3MxUU
        </p>
        <p>
          They [<b>misinterpreted</b>] what I [<b>said</b>], and [<b>assumed</b>] that I said [<b>drones disguised as birds</b>].
          Because they're [<b>professionals</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          They would know, if the [<b>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</b>] would have a [<b>drone</b>] that
          flies around, and [<b>mimics the sound of an actual bird, or a mockingbird</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was at the base, I suggested to (3) guards that I had an [<b>audio recording</b>] of something
          that I believed was a [<b>drone</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          The [<b>soldiers</b>] that [<b>came</b>] to the [<b>gate</b>] were rather [<b>dubious</b>] that what 
          I [<b>recorded</b>] was [<b>something rather advanced</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          They [<b>never collected</b>] the [<b>audio recording</b>], but they [<b>did</b>] ask me for my
          [<b>identification</b>], and then they told me to go to [<b>Washington D.C.</b>]
        </p>
        <p>
          I then said:<br>
          <i>"Thanks a lot you guys, you're doing the country a wonderful service. Go get those bad guys. Take care."</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          In response, [<b>Stratton Air National Guard</b>] contacted the [<b>Rotterdam Police Department</b>] because
          they didn't feel like contacting the [<b>Glenville Police Department</b>], which was the [<b>jurisdiction</b>]
          that I was actually in, at the time that this event took place... nor did they contact the [<b>Schenectady Police
          Department</b>], which was the jurisdiction I was in about a half hour later when I recorded these (2) exhibits...
        </p>

          (2) https://youtu.be/V-_YqedKZb8
        </p>
        <p>
          When they contacted the [<b>Rotterdam Police Department</b>], they made an [<b>executive decision</b>] to 
          contact the [<b>Saratoga County Sheriffs Office</b>], because who the hell knows...?
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe when you're a [<b>police department</b>], and you have to pretend to be constantly busy, you find ways
          to [<b>pass the buck around</b>] rather than to [<b>review the evidence</b>], and so, [<b>each police station</b>]
          acts as the [<b>bumpers</b>] in a [<b>pinball machine</b>], and hopefully the ball makes its way over to a guy
          like [<b>Scott Schelling</b>], where he can perform a [<b>welfare check</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          It probably sounds fuckin' stupid, but- that is [<b>exactly</b>] how they think.

# Narrative

Here's what I actually went to [Stratton Air National Guard] for.

They took the [reason] I went there, [out of context].

I'm making a big deal about all of this, because [they're making decisions] that they
believe are [informed], as in, [they would know ahead of time], that what I'm [attempting]
to [show them], is fucking stupid.

And that is the reason why things like this wind up happening:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach

So, if someone from another country like [CHINA] or [RUSSIA] is using this thing to spy
on US Citizens, they're [too fucking ignorant] to [investigate that].

They may think that it's a matter of importance, or that I'm just some fuckboy that
doesn't know what the hell I'm talking about when I say stuff, or whatever, but then
check these out...

10/04/22 | God Mode Cursor | https://youtu.be/dU_5rdVkCD8
09/26/22 | God Mode Cursor | https://youtu.be/tW80Zj_H6Fw

I mean, allow me to use the stupid fallacious logic that they use, to illustrate
how it's pretty dangerous to write stuff off immediately, without investigating a
fucking claim.

I may be the most intelligent person that ever lived, because I gotta be, in order
to have (2) video links of a thing that shows up called the "god mode cursor".

Gotta be.
It couldn't possibly be the case, that I'm NOT the most intelligent person that ever
lived, otherwise, why would I have (2) of these videos as well as other videos that
show other various glitches and exploits on operating systems that have been made
by the [Microsoft Corporation]...?

You see...?
I'm using [the same sort of logic that these people use], in order to [justify my claim].

The claim is...
I GOTTA be the most intelligent person that has ever lived, in order to have (2) videos
of this glitch. And because they are already aware of the fact that I'm the most intelligent
person that ever lived, that's why they don't have to [investigate] anything that I have 
on hand, because of how jealous they are, of how intelligent I am, and that's it.

Sounds fuckin' stupid, right...?
Right.

That's the [beginning] and the [end] of my claim here.
They can't investigate a god damn thing if their hands constantly go limp, when I say
"Check out this audio recording."

However, that is [exactly] what so many people do.

I can tell them:
[Me]: HEY, CHECK OUT THIS AUDIO RECORDING...

And they'll be CONFUSED, and somehow think that I said [DRONES DISGUISED AS BIRDS].

That's how stupid people actually are, when I talk to them, on a daily fucking basis.

To make matters even more compelling...?
I was able to collect ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE THAT THEY DIDN'T REALLY TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT,
after I made it to [Schenectady].

It truly is such a RECURRING THEME...

"Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups." -George Carlin

How many dozens of ways should I slice this...? I'm not insane...
I'm just a lot more intelligent than most people. That's ALL it is.
Am I the SMARTEST DUDE THAT EVER LIVED...? Nah.
Do I go around saying "HEY, SMARTEST DUDE YOU'LL EVER MEET IN YOUR LIFE, BRO~!"
Nope. I don't do that at all.
I just say "HEY, CHECK OUT THIS EVIDENCE I HAVE OF SOMETHING REALLY STRANGE~!"
And people immediately CONFUSE what the fuck I just said, like on a constant, every-day basis.

| Them : OoooOoOoHhHHhhhHHh Michael Cook said "Check out this audio recording of a bird."                    |

| Me   : I'm pretty sure it's not a real bird at all, because it sounds like it's ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.   |
| Them : YEA RIGHT BRO, IT'S NOT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, GO EAT A DICK~!                                    |
| Me   : Whatever you fuckin' moron.                                                                         |
|        I'd be willing to bet money on it, that DARPA made a project that does that.                        |
|        And, that they were interested in my activities because of these (3) audio logs...                  |
