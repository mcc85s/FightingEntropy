          I walked to [<b>Stratton Air National Guard</b>] because I had [<b>recorded multiple audio recordings</b>]
          of [<b>something</b>] that [<b>sounded</b>] a lot like [<b>an actual bird</b>].

          They [<b>misinterpreted</b>] what I [<b>said</b>], and [<b>assumed</b>] that I said [<b>drones disguised as birds</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          Because they're [<b>professionals</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          They would know, if the [<b>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</b>] would have a [<b>drone</b>] that
          flies around, and [<b>mimics the sound of an actual bird, or a mockingbird</b>].

          When I was at the base, I suggested to (3) guards that I had an [<b>audio recording</b>] of something 
          that I believed was a [<b>drone</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          The [<b>soldiers</b>] that [<b>came</b>] to the [<b>gate</b>] were rather [<b>dubious</b>] that what
          I [<b>recorded</b>] was [<b>something rather advanced</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          They [<b>never collected</b>] the [<b>audio recording</b>], but they [<b>did</b>] ask me for my [<b>identification</b>],
          and then they told me to go to [<b>Washington D.C.</b>]
        </p>
        <p>
          I then said:
          <i>"Thanks a lot you guys, you're doing the country a wonderful service. Go get those bad guys, and make sure you stay hydrated. Take care."</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          In response, [<b>Stratton Air National Guard</b>] contacted the [<b>Glenville Police Department</b>], who was like
          "Hey guys, let's check the area. By the way, have Saratoga County check the home for whatever reason."
          And then that is what they did.

          They couldn't find me even though I walked there on foot... Maybe it is extremely difficult to check the (1) road that they could've found me on,
          that leads to the base. About a half hour later I recorded these (2) exhibits...

          Maybe when you're a [<b>police department</b>], and you have to find ways to appear busy at 1AM, you find ways
          to [<b>pass the buck around</b>] rather than to [<b>review the evidence</b>], and so, [<b>each police station</b>]
          acts as the [<b>bumpers</b>] in a [<b>pinball machine</b>], and hopefully the ball makes its way over to a guy
          like [<b>Scott Schelling</b>], where he can perform a [<b>welfare check</b>].
        </p>
        <p>
          It probably sounds fuckin' stupid, but- that is [<b>exactly</b>] how they think.

They took the [**reason**] I went there, **[out of context**].
