:[June 27th, 2022]. [Michael Cook] speaking.

I have a uh- [confession] to make regarding my [mother].
My mother's goin' fuckin' senile.

And uh- I realize I'm surrounded by people that don't really care about the truth.

I think the people that do care about the truth...?
Piloting this drone the other night.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:01:20","00:01:50",@'
:I'm gonna fuckin' walk up to-
[Formal extension].
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:01:50","00:02:10",@'
:I don't know why the hell I'm recording this, because it's pointless to say what's on my mind.
I know this fuckin' robot drone exists, because I fuckin'...
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:02:10","00:02:34",@'
:I fuckin' miss my dad.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:02:34","00:03:19",@'
:Ya know, some people ask me some uh- questions about fuckin' [Bruce Tanski], and uh- [John Hoffman], right...?

Well, first off, nobody's gonna ask me a fuckin' god damn thing.
So I have to confront them.
Fuckin' ask THEM questions.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:03:19","00:03:45",@'
:Ya know, I think the reason why I have to like, insult people and fuckin' call em out, is because,
I'm smarter than their asses, and, I have to really roast people. To get their attention.

And then, make fun of em.
So I- like, I think about it this dude, [Tim Krom].

Ya know, who fuckin' flat out said to me OOooOoOhHhHh yeah, my dad got involved with the wrong people,
and that he owed people money for drugs, and that's why he got killed.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:03:45","00:04:15",@'
:But no, that dude is a dumbass son of a bitch to say that.
He's a fuckin' retard, actually.

He's a retard just like my mother is.
My mother's not a retard, but she's got brain damage.
I'm certain of it.

And so does uh- so do a lot of other people from that age group.

I'm startin' to notice it.
So like...
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:04:15","00:04:52",@'
:I think people just like to be respected, but they don't realize that uh-
A lot of people seem to think that respect is a two-way street. Er, a one-way street.

And uh... 
I really don't wanna end up in uh- jail or prison.
Nor have to like, fuckin' uh- have a-

...somebody's uh- pain and suffering on my conscience or me, ya know, getting hurt or killed.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:04:52","00:05:31",@'
:I think that's the thing, heh.
I think Fred just uh- earned my respect, because...

I know what he's thinkin', he's thinkin' a lot like so many other people.
People don't actually give a shit about how intelligent someone is.

They don't care if I can actually uh- ya know, make (175) dollars an hour.
They don't care if my mother's gonna inter- interrupt me right in the middle of a sentence where
I say "Oh yeah, I can make (175) dollars an hour, if not more."
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:05:31","00:06:06",@'
:The reason I'm not doing that is because my reputation has been damaged to the point where
someone has made it next to impossible for me to succeed at anything, and they've done such
a convincingly well job, that I am stuck in this position because a billionaire put me in this.

That billionaire, is [Mark Zuckerberg].
And probably, [John Pickett].
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:06:06","00:07:00",@'
:All these people, they're gettin' mad at me, but-
Ya know, I know for a fuckin' fact that [Bruce Tanski]'s doin' uh- committing [bank fraud].

And then, ya know, people are like:
[People]: Oh well, if he's gonna fuckin' commit [bank fraud], then what can ya do, or whatever...?

I'm like tryin' to tell them what I can do.

And they're like:
[People]: Nah, you can't do anything, dude.
          
          Because, you're a fuckin' degenerate, low life, piece of shit, and ya know, your own
          god damn mother's too fuckin' stupid to agree with anything that you say.
          
          And that, you have to respect your mother no matter how many times she insults you,
          and makes you feel totally useless.

          By the way, your father...?
          He like, scored perfectly on his ASVABS, and your father was a genius.
          And your father told a bunch of people, that he was worried about being killed.

And everybody fuckin' laughed at this genius, because...
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:07:00","00:07:58",@'
:That is how fucked up this world is.
Is that- someone that knows what the hell they're talking about, that they can fuckin' prove
that they know what they're talking about.

But-
People don't care.
People don't give a flying fuck.

Nope, they want you to shut the fuck up, and do what you're told.
And be obedient, because that's what everybody else does.

Sure, so like, what I need to do is, uh-
Do the same thing that I've done like dozens of times before, where I start a new job,
and then I just fuckin' haul ass, and I start fuckin' working harder than everybody,
and then I notice that like, someone else is gettin' paid a lot more money than I am...

But- I'm doing more work.
That's what these people don't seem to understand, is that they think I'm bullshitting them...
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:07:58","00:08:40",@'
:And that's- I think that's the part where they're fuckin' brain dead, or something.

It's like, I can go work with this dude, like I did back in fuckin' whatever.
I'm not afraid to work.

People seem to think that's what it is.
No.

And I have lost my fuckin' cool because, people really are fuckin' stupid, man.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:08:40","00:09:31",@'
:Yeah, I'm not goin' over there.
Yeah, I have a- 

I really should, just- jump into traffic.
Cause no one gives a shit.

And everyone is uh- I feel like uh-
Everyone thinks I'm insane, but I'm just a hell of a lot smarter than they are.

And that is consistently the case.
I can fuckin' walk around, for fuckin' hours recording my train of thought, tell em that (4) corners
of a rhomubus, as long as they're all (90) degrees, then that ALSO equals a square.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:09:31","00:09:59",@'
:Yeah, a rhombus and a square are only- are the same thing in that (1) single condition.
And then- people don't realize I walk around with that exact sense of logic, where, it is fuckin'
on point. It's so on point that just- people think that I'm insane.

They don't realize, I'm not insane at all.

It's so fuckin' stupid, it really is.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:09:59","00:10:37",@'
:Everybody on this fuckin' planet, probably doesn't realize that an extinction level event is
basically unavoidable.

The reason why it's unavoidable, is because- nobody gives a shit.
Well, some people give a shit, but-  not enough.

I've talked in circles trying to figure this out, and find a way out of this predicament, 
but- I really don't think that...

I really don't think that there's anything I can do.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:10:37","00:11:08",@'
:There's plenty I can do, to like uh- fuckin' go uh- do some bitch work, and then uh-
ya know, at some point, I'll have to fuckin' express the fact that- well, I happen to
be the [most efficient person that works here], why don't I get [paid the most]...?

And then someone'll be like:
[Someone]: Well, you fuckin', fucked up with this thing here...
           Da da da da da...

Yeah, no- what happened at uh- [Computer Answers], was that uh-
I was so fucking god damn skilled at the job that I outperformed people, like on the
first or second time that I went to go do jobs.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:11:08","00:11:51",@'
:And then, like, the owner got fuckin' jealous.
And uh- my mom says:
[Mom]: Hey, you need to fuckin' follow orders and do what you're told, that's it.

It's like, wow. You're a fuckin' idiot.
Yeah.

I'm not gonna fuckin' say "Hey ma, you're fuckin' correct about that, maybe what I need
to do, is be an obedient little bitch like everybody else. And then fuckin' bust my ass
for minimum wage, just like a bunch of other people..."

When I've already gone to fuckin' school, and spent money out the ass for my education,
yeah, I have the capability of making thousands of dollars an hour...

She doesn't give a shit.
She finds that hard to believe.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:11:51","00:12:19",@'
:The reason why she finds that hard to believe, is because my mother is an evil...
fucking...
cunt.

And she always will be, and I probably will be, very, very sad when I want to talk to her, 
after she passes away, but I can't. But- I've already gotten myself to the point where...

It is futile to have any conversation with her, at all.
Because she doesn't give a shit about what's accurate, and what isn't.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:12:19","00:13:07",@'
:So now, uh- I'm just this fuckin' supposedly, people think I'm this unhinged lunatic, right...?
No, all the things I say make plenty of sense, to someone who actually pays attention, and is
intelligent, and ya know cares about facts...?

Facts don't care about your feelings.
But- the fuckin' generation that my mother is from...
...they certainly think that feelings matter more than facts.

I swear, that is exactly what it is.
They don't care, if they have brain damage or not.

They will say- they don't have brain damage.

How are you suppos- how are you able to know, if you have brain damage...?
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:13:07","00:13:47",@'
:...if you immediately say there's no way that you've got it...?
That's a serious problem right there.

You have to be open to the idea that something is possible.
Something sounds... hard to believe, you can say that.
But you can't say something's impossible when it's just hard to believe.
Cause they're (2) totally different terms.

They're not the same thing.
And I'm stuck in this fuckin' position because I'm surrounded by people that
don't give a shit.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:13:47","00:14:38",@'
:Yeah, they- they're gonna fuckin' say that I'm like, ya know, up my own ass.

I don't know how to fuckin' uh- best apply my fuckin' talents and uh- focus, but-
What I can say, is that it's fuckin' pointless to try and fuckin' argue with people.

I just have to tell em "Listen, you're wrong, and shut the fuck up."
And then, they'll try to get in a fight with me, and then-

Like, look dude, facts don't care about your feelings...
And then they'll try to tell me:
[Them]: Dude, I'll fuckin'- I'll give you some feelings to fuckin' fact up.

Uh- they don't care.
What THEY think, is that their feelings matter more than the facts.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:14:38","00:15:30",@'
:That's why this fuckin' planet is fucked.
And nobody gives a flying fuck.
There are plenty of people that do, but- I'm fighting a futile. Fucking. Battle.
Over, and over.

Just, running right into a fuckin' brick wall.
Ya know, I could tell my mother that the judge ordered me to see (2) doctors that
don't even work a the fuckin' place he ordered me to go to.

And when I tell him that...?
He's gonna fuckin' disconnect me from the phone call, and sentence me to (20) fuckin'
days in jail.

So- ya know, uh- this dipshit at the fuckin' court, [Dennis Bruce].
He can suck a fuckin' dick for all I care, and uh- heh.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:15:30","00:16:10",@'
:These people can indiscriminately just throw me back in jail for any fuckin' reason
they want to, they don't HAVE to follow the law. They can break the law as often as 
they fuckin' feel like it, because they don't give a shit.

That's what I think about the whole entire system here, in uh- [America].
People are fuckin' stupid.

And when I try to tell them, how things really are, they will argue with me, to the point
where, it is pointless.

So, that's why I started writing this fuckin' book because, I know god damn full well,
more than a lot of other people, and, they will try to argue with me, just like my fuckin'
mother does.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:16:10","00:17:12",@'
:So I've realized that the ol', the entire point, of me existing, was to be born, and then...
try to be- be correct all the time...? But- be told by people that I'm NOT correct.
Even though I am.
Yeah, a lot of people do that.

Like, a square and a rhombus are the same thing in (1) condition.
In no other condition are they the same fuckin' thing.

But my mother will fuckin' argue with that.
She'll say:
[Mom]: No, a fuckin' square and a rhombus are never the same thing.

Even though, she never fuckin' went to college or got her degree,
or this, that and the other thing, eh- people...

Wanna be re- they tell me to respect my mother, when she fuckin' insults me
every fuckin' day. She also got my father fuckin' killed.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:17:12","00:18:00",@'
:And then people give me useless suggestions, whether it's the
[Saratoga County Sheriffs Office], ya know, people from [Saratoga County]...?

They actually don't give a shit.
They just do whatever the hell they want to.
They don't have to be fuckin' accurate.
Even if you catch them in a recording, and you put it online, well somebody's
gonna fuckin censor that fuckin' information from being heard by other people.

And that's literally what fuckin' happens to me, and then people just think
that I'm being fuckin silly, or ridiculous... but- I'm not being fucking
ridiculous at all.

I could s- I literally have a video that could bankrupt [Mark Zuckerberg] right
fuckin' now, but nobody's gonna click on it, nor care about it.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:18:00","00:18:49",@'
:I'm trying to use reverse psychology because I'm sure that some people DO care about
what was- what's in the video, but- most people aren't gonna be intelligent to see
what it is, or know what it is.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:18:49","00:19:22",@'
:Prolly never gonna fuckin' see that thing again...
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:19:22","00:20:08",@'
:I'm basically lost.
I may as well already fuckin' be dead.
That's how it feels.

And uh- these cocksuckers are aware of that.

Nobody actually cares about the truth.
Try to tell em, someone like [Mark Zuckerberg]'s gonna prevent them from knowing.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:20:08","00:21:00",@'
:Eh, nobody gives a shit, dude.

My life was a fuckin' lost cause.
I don't know why I fuckin' tried to believe in the truth.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:21:00","00:23:51",@'
:How's it goin'...?
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:23:51","00:24:26",@'
:What the fuck...?
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:24:26","00:24:41",@'

$T.X(2,"00:24:48","00:24:50",@'

$T.X(2,"00:24:54","00:24:56",@'

$T.X(3,"00:24:56","00:24:58",@'

$T.X(1,"00:25:01","00:25:06",@'
:Well, watch.
Just push it, because the thing- the knob on the bottom still doesn't work right.

$T.X(1,"00:25:11","00:25:13",@'
:No I don't, that's why I said, it's not locked.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:25:13","00:25:15",@'
:I just checked it, it IS locked.
'@)

$T.X(1,"00:25:15","00:25:20",@'
:Alright...
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:25:20","00:25:30",@'
:My whole entire life, you do that.

$T.X(2,"00:25:30","00:25:31",@'
:It's the stupid bottom handle.

:Nah I understand that, but you know that she does that, right...?
Mike...
She's done that to me my fuckin' whole life.

She did that to me when I was a little kid.
She still does it to me.
