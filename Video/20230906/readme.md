# Game Design (Series) [09/17/2023]

| Description |
|:------------|
| This section will be the temporary location for the (**Game Design**) series. <br><br>[**(0) Game Design (Part I) (08/30/2023)**] The first video is called (**Game Design Part I**), and the original video with its' markdown file and documents can be found **[here](https://github.com/mcc85s/FightingEntropy/tree/main/Video/20230830)**. <br><br>[**(1) Rapha vs Evil (09/06/2023**] is mostly commentary about the full grand finals matchup between Shane Hendrixson (**Rapha**) and Sergey Orehkov (**Evil**) at [**QuakeCon 2016**], and includes commentary that relates to game design. <br><br>[**(2) 09/11/2023**] covers the map that I have been drawing out since I created the first video, as well as playtesting various levels. <br><br>[**(3) 09/17/2023**] is a collection of Q3A maps that I've considered using to exhibit their gameplay, and high build quality level design. In order to continue building the level, I decided to play a slew of levels from **[..::LvL]**, which is a website where many of my maps, as well as many others from the community may be found. I also cover to some small degree, some [PowerShell]. I've been slowly updating the (**.docx**) and (**.pdf**) files that are located in this folder. |
