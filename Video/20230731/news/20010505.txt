[BFGDM2A] is kind of one of those projects I don\u0027t really want to finish but I\r\nknow I have to...\r\n\r\nI\u0027ll probably finish that sometime soon. [HELL-RA3MAP1-BETA5] will be released next month... and\r\n[HELL-RA3MAP2-BETA1] will be released sometime this weekend. Note that this map will only have two\r\narenas, [Suspended Animation], and [Space Station 1138].\r\n\r\nThe multi-arena as I\u0027m thinking it should be, will probably be [Q3DM17]...\r\nGo figure =)\r\n\r\n\u003c|3FG20K\u003e"
