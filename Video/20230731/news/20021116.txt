I will soon add more features to the page, particularly ones that are user\r\nfriendly and expand their functionality.\r\n\r\nLast Update: Due to increasing demand, I will revive the [Return to Castle: Quake] map, as soon as I\r\nget a chance. I am deciding whether or not to expand the map, or leave it as is and push for a final.\r\n\r\nYou decide folks, drop me a line: [bfg20k@nycap.rr.com]\r\n\r\n\u003c|3FG20K\u003e"
