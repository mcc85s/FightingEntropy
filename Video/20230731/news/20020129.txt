Back in October, I planned to release a map for [Urban Terror] for the UT contest.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as I upgraded my [hard drive], I made the stupid mistake of shorting the [old one] that\r\nhad all of my stuff on it, as well as the [new hard drive]. So I waited for a while to get a\r\nreplacement, and I\u0027ve just been trying to get my computer up and running like it used to be.\r\n\r\nAt that point, I just didn\u0027t feel like mapping for a little while.\r\nNow I am definitely up and running, so I would like to spread the good news that I have a few maps\r\nthat I plan to push out the door. The first is a map called [Return to Castle: Quake]. It is a simple\r\nlevel with basic solid architecture (this is the map I intended on releasing for the UT contest) and\r\nsolid tournament gameplay, with the [Evil 7] Texture set.\r\n\r\nSecondly, is a map called [Tower of Oblivion] that I\u0027ve finished making plans for and only started\r\nmapping. Lastly, I don\u0027t know if I will make it, but I did pump out a beta on LvL called [The Level],\r\nif all goes well with the former maps, then I\u0027ll consider finishing that one.\r\n\r\nAlso, my friend Zer0_Co0l is making maps now, and I hope to add his maps to my page...\r\nIf you play HELLRA3MAP1 and play [Tranquil Equilibrium], you\u0027ll probably notice a separate style from\r\nthe other four, that\u0027s because he is the one that originally made the stairwell areas.\r\n\r\nFinally, my favorite map, [20KDM1] was reviewed on [..::LvL] a little while ago, and it got a pretty\r\ndecent review =).\r\n\r\nHere\u0027s the little extra work I put in during that long wait [Return To Castle: Quake].\r\nSo until the next update, so long chums.\r\n\r\n\u003c|3FG20K\u003e"
