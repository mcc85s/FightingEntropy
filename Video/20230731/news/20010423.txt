Where should I begin?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I\u0027d like to introduce myself.\r\nMy name is Mike Cook, I\u0027m 15, and I map a lot.\r\n\r\nI don\u0027t just map a lot, but I like to keep in particular, [Quake III Arena].\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve done several projects over the last (11) months, with my first few completely sucking...\r\nI\u0027ll try to pump out some remakes of them or something.\r\n\r\nLately, I have been trying to complete a clan arena for a gothic themed [RA3] map that I might\r\njust throw out of the window because who wants another gothic map...?\r\n\r\nI have began to think that maybe I could catch the eye of a few with a space [RA3] map...\r\nYeah, that\u0027s the ticket...\r\n\r\nImagine playing a [Space RA3] map - Yeah, I know what you\u0027re thinking though... \r\n\"That\u0027s going to be mad gay because people will fall off of the edges easily, and the guys\r\nthat are wicked good with the Railgun will own.\"\r\n\r\nDon\u0027t worry about it, I\u0027ve got it covered.\r\nSo far, the past two DM levels I\u0027ve been working on:\r\n[+] [Space Station 1138]\r\n[+] [Suspended Animation] \r\n...will be included, and I\u0027m *probably* going to stick in [Q3DM17 - The Longest Yard], \r\nwith credits to [ID Software] that is =)\r\n\r\nI\u0027m going to keep my [Counter-Strike] mapping to a minimum because my friend [Malakili]\r\nwhom I\u0027ve helped learned how to map is probably going to take over all of the projects we\u0027ve\r\nworked on together, 100%.\r\n\r\nIf you\u0027ve got any questions for me, you [Quake Community] you, go ahead and e-mail me at:\r\n[bfg20k@nycap.rr.com]. \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\u003c|3FG20K\u003e"
