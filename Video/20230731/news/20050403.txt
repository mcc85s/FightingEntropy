    "Content":  "Wow. I have not updated my site for a very long time!\r\n\r\nMy apologies, I have been going to school and working full time with no time to spend on making maps.\r\nWith that said, I would like to inform everybody, that I, Michael \u003c|3FG20K\u003e, have devised a plan that\r\nextrudes into [Quake 4].\r\n\r\nUpon the release of [Quake 4], I will unleash upon the [Quake Community], this new map which has been\r\npretty much complete for some time - I have not released it due to this lame error which prevents the\r\nbots from being able to navigate and provide any fun for playing against.\r\n\r\nSO, like I said, I have a brand new map waiting to be released as soon as [Quake 4] is complete.\r\n[Doom 3] is a good game,- which is at your local [Walmart] or [Target].\r\n\r\nI played it and beat it on [nightmare] which was a bitch and a half, your life drains to (25) all the\r\ntime but at least you get to use the [Soul Cube] from the very beginning of the game.\r\n\r\nI suggest that if anyone who is reading this has [Doom 3] and hasn\u0027t beaten it on [Nightmare], you\r\nshould invest at least (20) minutes a day in trying to do just that because [Nightmare] is definitely\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, not that this is in any way related to [Quake], but I bought my cousin who is (8)\r\nmonths older than me a copy of [Halo 2] for Christmas. He beat it on [regular], than [heroic], and I\r\nfinally talked him into playing it on [legendary].\r\n\r\nWell, he beat the game on [legendary] and I don\u0027t know many people who had the time to do that so if\r\nyou have, drop me a note at [BFG20K@HOTMAIL.COM] and I will congratulate you.\r\n\r\nTo spoil his fun, I have become so competent at [Halo 2] that my cousin cannot beat me when we play\r\nagainst each other - go figure.\r\n\r\nOk. I\u0027ve said a bunch of stuff, I have more to say, but not right now.\r\nLike I said, i\u0027m sorry for the lack of updates but I have schooling to complete then you can all see\r\nwhat it is I\u0027m going to school for.... Muhahaha! =)\r\n\r\nOk, have fun.\r\nStay in school, don\u0027t be a fool... and don\u0027t get caught playing pocket pool.\r\n\r\n\u003c|3FG20K\u003e"
