    "Content":  "So, it is currently [07/29/23 @ 2113 EST], and I\u0027ve been working to build a Xaml based application\r\nthat shows off my mapping portfolio from [Quake III Arena]. I have been accumulating a bunch of\r\nmapping related content as well as general [Q3A] play over the last couple weeks.\r\n\r\nToday, I said to myself... \"I could totally make an application that hosts all of the map information\r\nas well as videos and stuff, couldn\u0027t I...?\"\r\n\r\nNobody was in eyesight or earshot to respond \"Yeh man. You totally could. So, why don\u0027t you...?\"\r\n\r\nAnyway, yeh. Sometimes... people have stuff to do.\r\nOther times, stuff gets done after it\u0027s conceptualized and made.\r\nIn rare instances, stuff does itself... and people just sit around watching stuff happen.\r\n\r\nIf that sounds vague...?\r\nThat\u0027s because it\u0027s meant to sound pretty vague, and comedic.\r\nIf [you can\u0027t just blow a hole in Mars]...?\r\n\r\nThen you can\u0027t just talk about stuff in a [non-descript manner] whereby causing people to wonder what\r\nthe hell is really going on, or what is really being said.\r\n\r\nNah. Gotta keep people in [suspense] and stuff, that\u0027s why being [vague] is pretty important.\r\n\r\nYou don\u0027t wanna just [let the cat out of the bag], whereby allowing everybody to see what the cat\r\nlooks like.\r\n\r\n...you have to talk about the [shape] of the cat...\r\n...the [personality] of the cat...\r\n...what color fur the cat has...\r\n...what the cat sounds like...\r\n...what the cat doesn\u0027t like...\r\n...and whether or not the cat in question, has an air of [sassiness] or [snarkiness] about it.\r\n\r\nOnce all is said and done...?\r\nThe cat will eventually come out of the bag in entirety for all to see.\r\n\r\nUntil then...?\r\nThe cool cat is going to take it\u0027s time waiting for the perfect moment, to come out of the bag.\r\n\r\n\u003c|3FG20K\u003e"
