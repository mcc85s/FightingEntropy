[Return to Castle: Quake (Test)]\r\nAs it is, you can play [Free-For-All] with up to (4) players, or you could play in Tourney mode.\r\nI\u0027ve had to rebuild the entire map, with help from [q3map.exe] of course, so I haven\u0027t gotten to\r\nplacing any detail outside of the castle.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it\u0027s promising as it is - It\u0027s not [ZTN], or [Charon], but maybe the next best thing.\r\nHave fun fraggers!\r\n\r\nAlternate download site: [Return to Castle: Quake (Test)]\r\n\r\n\u003c|3FG20K\u003e"
