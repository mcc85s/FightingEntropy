    "Content":  "With the summer of (2005) ending, and a decade halfway gone, I want to take a look back and reflect\r\nupon the time that has passed ever so diligently. In doing so, I can remember being (15) years old\r\njust drawing out maps on pieces of paper for [q2] and [q3], hoping that some of them may see the\r\nlight of day.\r\n\r\nIndeed some of them have, where many of them have fallen through the cracks of reality unable to reach\r\nout to players halfway around the world which make them say \"this map rocks\".\r\nThat should be the aim of any game developer.\r\n\r\nIt seems that people who make games these days just take advantage of hype, sell (200K) copies, and\r\nthen go home and buy a [Ferrari]. What happened to the jam packed games like [Super Mario Brothers],\r\n[Road Rash], and [Warcraft 2]?\r\n\r\nI\u0027ll tell you what happened, developers sold out.\r\nI\u0027ll be the first to admit, I know people who play [MMORPG]\u0027s, [Counterstrike], and I know people who\r\nplay Gamecube, Xbox, and PS2. When they say they play this or that, I think, how much fun are you\r\nhaving overall?\r\n\r\nI realized one day when I was playing [Counterstrike] that I didn\u0027t like the fact that I was playing\r\nthe friggen game over, and over, and over again. Sure the game is great, the maps and content are\r\ngreat, but it\u0027s just a game that becomes addicting - smokers smoke cigarettes because they put it\r\ninto their brain that they should have a cigarette when they want to have a little fun.\r\n\r\nHowever, when they smoke that cigarette, they feel empty like nothing is actually happening... even\r\nthough they\u0027re taking a drag and spitting out mucous.\r\n\r\nWhy can\u0027t games be great and not be addicting? Like, I if I want to be able to play Quake for (10)\r\nminutes, and actually get somewhere and have fun in that period of time, I don\u0027t want to have to be\r\nreeled in to play for another few hours and skip out on the rest of my life.\r\n\r\nThat\u0027s where the glory of [Quake 3] comes around.\r\n\r\nThe single player game wasn\u0027t all that and a bag of chips, but at least if you knew that you had\r\nsomething to do, you could just say \u0027Ok, I\u0027m playing this level and that\u0027s it\u0027. \r\n\r\nIn [Counterstrike] and [WoW], you have to get into the game, get yourself set up, and then when you\r\ndie or something, you end up getting pissed off because you\u0027re waiting for other people to allow you\r\nto continue your fun experience.\r\n\r\n[Quake] is so unlike any other game or shooter out there.\r\nYou load a map up, you pick up weapons, and you shoot people.\r\n\r\nIf you die, you spawn somewhere else and you don\u0027t have to wait on anybody else.\r\nThe game happens so fast.\r\n\r\nThe greatest thing about it is that you can play this game over and over and in the game there are\r\nalways new strategies you can use, AND even though [Quake 3] is (6) years old, it still looks more\r\nbeautiful to me than [Half Life 2].\r\n\r\nI\u0027m serious here, when you play [Half Life 2], you are addicted to the game, and that\u0027s the only real\r\nimpact it has. Just like [Doom 3], I got to a point in [HL2] where I just wanted to beat the game and\r\nI wasn\u0027t having any fun playing it.\r\n\r\nIn [Quake], your objective has always been to have the most frags while the game\u0027s colors just jump\r\nout at you and say \u0027I\u0027m just as good looking as [Carmen Electra] naked.\u0027 It all happens in the midst\r\nof rockets flying in and out of your face.\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s turning into these days that a lot of people are computer leeches, stuck to the computer, unable\r\nto get off their ass and do something productive. These games act upon sour self indulgence, and it\u0027s\r\nsickening.\r\n\r\n[Quake] has always been a game where you could play and not necessarily be addicted.\r\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, this is all a matter of opinion.\r\nMy opinion.\r\n\r\nI\u0027ve seen [Counterstrike] turn into such an overwhelming success ever since I started playing beta 3.\r\nI had a lot more fun back then than I do playing the game now, even though it is still quite good to\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nI remember playing [Quake 2] on my old [Packard Bell] back on the [Christmas of 1997], saying to\r\nmyself, this game rocks. I ended up beating the game and didn\u0027t touch it for almost a whole year\r\nwhere some of my friends at school were like \u0027Oh hell yeah, we play this game online.\u0027\r\n\r\nI started playing it online, one match, each night.\r\nEventually I got good at the game and I started playing it more, but anytime I wanted to stop,\r\nor start again, it was all instantaneous, it wasn\u0027t like I had to set this up, then set that up and\r\nmake sure that my upkeep was all complicated or anything. Just clean, simple, fun.\r\n\r\nThis should be a challenge for game developers;\r\nThere needs to be [very simple goals], not [one goal] that is elongated by a series of imps jumping\r\nout of doors clawing at your face, or driving a dune buggy along the coast of the ocean for 15 hours\r\nat a time, something simple.\r\n\r\nMy idea of a game is one where you can have fun at any given time - be it through fragging some\r\npeople, or making a shitload of ogres and sending them over to your enemies\u0027 town, instead of solving\r\npuzzles and running through hallways, then running all the way back through the level again, that\u0027s\r\njust not fun in my opinion...\r\n\r\nGames that are fast, and furious, are the ones that people enjoy the most, even if they\u0027re not\r\nplaying them all the time.\r\n\r\n[Quake 4] is going to be the answer.\r\n[Quake 4] is going to be the best game ever made for a long time, I swear to god it will be.\r\n(^ It wasn\u0027t...)\r\n\r\n\u003c|3FG20K\u003e"
