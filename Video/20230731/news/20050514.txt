    "Content":  "The long awaited game, [Doom 3] has come to store shelves and rocked the world with:\r\n[+] [stunning lighting]\r\n[+] [stellar shadows]\r\n[+] [obscene graphics]\r\n[+] [wicked sound]\r\n\r\nWith that having been said, is has left a [deep impression] in the gaming community, leaving disputes\r\nto be made about whether it really does hold true that it is the best rendering engine ever released\r\nby anyone.\r\n\r\nWell, it is. It\u0027s not a matter of opinion, [Valve]\u0027s [Half Life 2] has a very cool engine as well,\r\nbut it comes down to the actual rendering, not little tricks behind the rendering scene.\r\n\r\n[Half Life 2] DOES contain more interactive features and realistic details, however, when reverting\r\nback to [Doom 3], please remember, these graphics have been taken above and beyond what people can\r\ncall [realistic].\r\n\r\nWith the release of [Doom 3] in [August 2004], millions of gamers have witnessed the energy it\r\nharnesses. Some people playing the game lack the machinery to maintain a \u0027fun\u0027 experience from this\r\ngame, while others have no complaints...\r\n\r\nIn either scenario, the impression the game has left upon it\u0027s gamers is very deep - this game is\r\nobscenely revolutionary.\r\n         \r\nThe storyline of the original [Doom] was simple - you are the only marine left alive and you want to\r\nknow why, so you start running around picking up weapons and destroying demons.\r\n\r\nThe storyline of [Doom 3] is that you are able to see what happens behind the scenes before anything\r\nhappens. Released as an addition to [Doom 3], is [Resurrection of Evil], the first expansion for this\r\nkiller thriller.\r\n\r\nWhile [RoE] makes an overall improvement over [Doom 3], it still leaves the gamer wanting more.\r\nNow lets not jump to conclusions and call this a bad thing, usually when a game is made very well,\r\npeople want to have \u0027stuff\u0027 to venture through for the next few decades and very few people realize\r\nthe limitations of making a game.\r\n\r\nWell all I\u0027m saying is that I was thoroughly impressed with [Doom 3].\r\nI thought the game flowed rather nicely and the only thing really \u0027wrong\u0027 with the game was that\r\nthere were definitely too many imps jumping at me through the door...\r\n\r\nThere\u0027s nothing you can friggen do about it at some doors and that becomes a [nightmare] in... \r\n[Nightmare] skill. Alright, back to [RoE]. The reason I felt that [RoE] made an overall improvement\r\nover [Doom 3] was because it added so much more to the game.\r\n\r\nI found that the new little grabber gun gave me a one up on all those friggen imps and flying skulls,\r\nand it gives you an advantage because you don\u0027t have to waste all that necessary ammo.\r\n\r\nThe double barreled shotgun was also a nice touch - except I kept getting angry when I wanted to use\r\nthe single shotgun and it kept going to my double.\r\n\r\nThe new enemies are definitely a cool element, the new imps are alot smarter and for some reason they\r\nhave a bigger scratching distance... If you get to a certain point in the expansion, you will not see\r\none single original imp for the several next levels.\r\n\r\n(Do not read this paragraph if you have not played the game yet)\r\nThe artifact is definitely the coolest addition to the game. While it is not an actual weapon itself,\r\nthe features it gives you are priceless in many points in this game. There are three features that the\r\nartifact gives the player once you eliminate each of the special demons from hell.\r\n\r\nThe first one slows down time so slow that everything sounds and looks very slow but your speed\r\nremains the same. \r\n\r\nThe second feature is berserk, you can kill almost everything with one fist punch and it acts like\r\nthe quad damage from Quake.\r\n\r\nThe third and most-definitely-the-biggest-bitch-to-get is invulnerability... \r\n\r\nOnce you ascertain all (3) of these seals you can use the [human souls] scattered through all of the\r\nlevels to bring these features to your demand. Let me get this straight, you cannot beat this game\r\nwithout the artifact, it IS impossible.\r\n\r\nThere is no way you can beat this game without it and if anyone tells you, they are lying.\r\n(^ Well, maybe there\u0027s a glitch or something that\u0027ll allow a speedrunner to bypass via any%...)\r\n\r\n(You can start reading again)\r\nNow, onto the game depiction. One of the main reasons I found this more exciting than the original\r\n[Doom 3] was that there were so many things that were streamlined. I wasn\u0027t wasting any time trying\r\nto figure things out, they were all right there and I didn\u0027t really have to backtrack like we all did\r\nin [Doom 3].\r\n\r\nA lot of the flow is generally built with the same direction in mind, there\u0027s no \u0027oh I gotta find\r\nthe [PDA] then get the code, then go back through the whole level to activate the switch to then go\r\nback all the way through the level and then be able to activate another switch to go back to the\r\nbeginning of the map...\u0027\r\n\r\nNo, none of that, it\u0027s actually logical.\r\nMaybe I\u0027m pointing out the flaws of [Doom 3], but that\u0027s ok because I felt that [RoE] really picked\r\nup where [Doom 3] left off. Another cool thing is that [RoE] actually uses alot of the old materials\r\nfrom the original [Doom 3], like the airlocks, elevators, bits and pieces of the levels, etc.\r\n\r\nI found that the maps looked and played a lot better than they did on the original [Doom 3].\r\nIf you get to the end of [RoE], you\u0027ll see how extreme they really went in making this...\r\n\r\nThe last level is just insane...\r\nThe ending boss is modelled so exponentially better than in any game I\u0027ve ever seen, and I was\r\nhonored to see the [ending cinematic] and actually understand what had happened.\r\n\r\nTo sum it all up, I think that the actual ending should have been extruded quite a bit, at least show\r\nwhat happened had happened instead of leaving me the ability to fill in the blank. It\u0027s cool though,\r\nand I suggest to any gamer who is a fan of doom and didn\u0027t really like [Doom 3], that even though you\r\nmay not have liked it, [RoE] definitely picks up where [Doom 3] left off on so many tangents.\r\n\r\nA lot of people feel that the game has been extruded all in the same, but there are alot more\r\nelements to deal with, and alot more weapon switching. In fact, you\u0027ll find that the actual gunning\r\ndown of the enemies is useless with just one weapon, because you have so many different tactics at\r\nyour disposal, and plenty of ammo at several points in the game.\r\n\r\nYou don\u0027t have to worry about \u0027oh my god, I have to use the assault rifle because I\u0027m out of shotgun\r\nshells and this and that and .....\u0027 blah. [RoE] definitely fed my appetite for more [Doom 3] and it\r\ndid more than make me full, it made me want seconds.\r\n \r\nHopefully [Quake 4] will pick up where [RoE] AND [Quake 2] left off...\r\nI will explode from all of the [1337n3ss]!!!\r\n\r\n\u003c|3FG20K\u003e"
