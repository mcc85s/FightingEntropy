[Existentialism] (noun): a philosophical theory or approach which emphasizes the existence of the individual
person as a free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of the will. 

[Optimistic] (adj): hopeful and confident about the future

On [September 26, 2023], I responded to a post on [Facebook] written by a friend of mine, [Corey Betz] who I
used to play [Quake] with many, many years ago. For many years, I hadn't kept in touch with him, through no
fault of my own, or his.

I believe that is because, in life, many of the friends a person meets along the way in life, they may wind up
becoming more and more distant, taking separate paths along this labyrinth of obstacles we call our lives.

In summary, I suppose that is because life is rather [unpredictable].

That said, I'm going to [unpack] and [examine] the post he wrote, because I fear younger generations are having
more and more difficulty in asking basic questions about their existence, but it also applies to my generation
and even older.

I consider many [philosophical implications] that require an understanding of these many various components I've
described thus far, which is essentially the core component of [existentialism].
"@)

$Doc.Add("Premise",@"
There were a lot of takeaways in his post, much like the subject I had learned in school.

But before I post what was stated, I'm going to continue to talk about the premise of this document, as I
believe that our society is [riddled] with [problems] that are [resultant] to a [clear lack of empathy and
communication], and this stuff isn't likely to be covered at great [breadth], [scope], and [length] by the
education system...

Unless of course, you're talking about clinical psychologist professors like [Jordan Petersen],
neurological scientists like [Robert Sopolsky], linguistic master [Noam Chomsky], a socioeconomic
advisor like [Jeremy Rifkin], and even famous comedian and storyteller, the late and great [George Carlin].

But even then- when [professors] such as these have taken the [initiative] to [capitalize] on their fields
of expertise, the [retention of information] they have to [teach] and [share] comes down to the [individual].

Whether or not the [individual] is able to [apply the principles] they have chosen to share, [application]
of these [concepts] to [life] and [philosophy] in general... [is a difficult task in the modern era].

I believe that is because ... I don't know. In some way, I want to apply some of the blame to [technology],
but that alone isn't the root cause of these many issues. The root cause is [the human condition].

As I've aged, I've become [more] and [more] in tune with asking myself the very questions that [life] causes
ANY intellectual person to think about, and this process is [practically impossible] for an [individual] to
do on their own, unless they have been given the [proper guidance].

It is even more difficult when someone such as myself, has endured the traumatic experience of my father
[Michael Edward Cook]'s murder in 1995, and the [emotional abandonment] of my mother...
[Fabienne Silvie Kivlen Cook].

Simply put, there are so many people born into this world, who are expected to figure it out on their own,
without some sort of [mentor], or (parental/guardian) figure... and in this process, people are churned
out in droves, who have [no clear foundation] on how to manage their [lives], [feelings], or [relationships]
with other people.

That said, I'm going to cover the many things my friend [Corey Betz] had said, as well as his original
post, and coalesce many of the points made by [Corey], and myself, as well as the aforementioned professors,
into a [series of concepts] that may be [fundamentally useful] and [productive] in the field of [philosophy].

[Philosophy] (love of wisdom in ancient Greek) is a [systematic study] of general and fundamental
[questions] concerning topics like [existence], [reason], [knowledge], [value], [mind], and [language].

It is a [rational] and [critical inquiry] that reflects on its own [methods] and [assumptions].

In my own words, [philosophy] comes down to the [individual], asking [basic questions] about [life] and
[existence]. These [questions] range from "How much of something do I have to (be/do), in order for what
I'm doing to make any sense.", to "how much bullshit do I have to put up with before what I do makes
any difference in this world, or the next."

Those last (3) words there should indicate that I've met a lot of resistance from society in general,
and that I have come to consider that no matter how much focus and attention I provide to my writing...
...maybe it won't be received in THIS lifetime.

Perhaps the next.

In the [Third Industrial Revolution], professor [Jeremy Rifkin] talks about how the world is full of
problems that have to be resolved at some point, otherwise humanity will be forced to gracefully welcome
its' own [extinction level event]. I'm not exaggerating there, I believe that... 

...at this rate...
...it is [inevitable]...
...unless of course...
...I can make sense of all of this, or someone else does.
"@)

$Doc.Add("Professors",@"
[Jeremy Rifkin] describes himself as an optimist, perhaps being on the verge of [utopian], though
having a sense of being [grounded] in [realistic expectations], knowing that his beliefs are shrouded
in [nuances] and [obstacles] that come down to [the human condition].

[George Carlin] gets up on stage and talks about his [observations] and even [frustrations] in many
cases, and explains with his [flawless logic], how things can be [predicted] and [expected]. 

In SOME cases he says things that are [outright ridiculous] in order to [create] an incredibly powerful
[punchline] at the tail end, one that causes the [audience] to realize his [masterful application] of 
[reverse psychology].

[Jordan Petersen], though relatively new in the grand scheme of these guys, typically talks about
how the young man has to overcome [so much adversity] in the modern world, and puts a lot of effort
into describing many of the same things as [George Carlin], albeit with a radically different
delivery that is [more understanding and direct], and uses less [reverse psychology].

[Noam Chomsky], the [grandmaster] in the scheme of things I've mentioned, really drives home many
points about how [the entire system is rigged in varying degrees], and that the people at the apex
of leadership often fail to acknowledge their own shortcomings, in exchange for [publicity and/or power].

[Robert Sopolsky], the neuroscientist, covers various elements of psychology and underlying disorders
that are difficult to diagnose without [proper experience], which requires [years] and [years] of study
and [mastery] to [understand] and [communicate].

Many of these [professors] (...as I consider [George Carlin] to be a professor...) I've rattled off, 
have shared their experiences in the [scientific model] and found ways to [communicate] their
[revelations] with audiences ranging from the (young + naive), to the (old + inexorable).

That said, this [rhetoric] of mine is just a [series of observations] I've made by watching them all
talk at length about [the human condition], but it very well applies to [existentialism].

\ Optimistic Existentialism | Reddit discussion \
/___________________________|___________________/

I've seen many people say they have a tough time coping with an [existentialist world view].
However, this is something I [fail] to understand.

What could be more enjoyable than knowing you're in [control] of your [personal life]...? 

Personally, I think it's the most freeing and happy [philosophy].

It would be [depressing] if instead, I lived in a world where I wasn't responsible, and couldn't have a
true impact on my [life] and [future] and have it instead, decided by a [deity]. (...sorta happening...)

There is no happier philosophy to me than [existentialism], so why is it some feel [depressed] about it...?

/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯/
\ OVDose \
/________/

The [depression] and [negative thoughts] arise, when people realize the [full extent of their responsibility].
(...Or, they do enough research into financial institutions and the central banks managing $20T of assets...)

You can no longer excuse [your actions] by alluding to some [twisted fate] or [lack of control]. 
(...sometimes you can...)

Some people would be [happier] giving their life up entirely to [fate], rather than being forced to take
responsibility for finding their own meaning in the chaos.

/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯/
\ Corey \
/_______/

So I came to the conclusion after basically a long term ego death, that I was in fact a optimistic
existentialist.

Then I ALSO realized how many people could not handle that perspective. 

So, during my readings I found that a while back and found it to be [very insightful] towards why others
seem to not understand the glory of [taking full accountability].

/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯/
\ Michael \
/_________/

Alright, so...

I wrote an essay to chime in here, considering I've put a shitload of thought into this, for many years.

That's the same sort of philosophy I once had, until I started scripting and programming.

With a computer, you enter input, and you get a predictable output.

With people, if you give them input, you're really at a loss when it comes to [consistently] and
[accurately predicting] the [output].

[Psychology] comes into mind, particularly state of mind.
[Everybody's state of mind constantly fluctuates], and while some may APPEAR to be more stable than others...
...that's typically just a measurement of their [quality of life], not necessarily their [mentality],
[intelligence], or [sociability].

What does any of this have to do with being an [optimistic existentialist],
or just [existentialism] in general...?

Think about [testing] whether something [exists], or [doesn't exist], this process is called [validation].

With a computer, [validation] can be pretty simple, but it [ranges] to being [rather complicated], depending
on how much data needs to be [processed] to [achieve the result].

With people, [validation] requires so many more variables, and no matter who it is, a lot of [assumptions]
or [speculations] need to be made, in order to ask even the most simple [philosophical questions], to get a
reliable [answer].

[Economics], [market analysis], and [data analytics] make people out to be pretty [predictable…] but it really
is difficult to reliably predict [everything] about peoples personal lives, whereas with computers, they do not
have to balance a [personal life] and [professional life] at all… so, it is [far easier] to [predict] what a
[computer] will do.

That's because every single person falls into a [spectrum] where they believe they have [free will] to make
decisions, or if everything comes down to a [divine plan] and [everything] is [destined] and [preordained].

In other words, [nobody has total control over their own life], and trying to attain [THAT] much control
[displaces problems elsewhere] that are difficult to [detect] or [see]... and it comes down to [empathy].

Our society teaches people to [shut off their empathy], in exchange for modern amenities (materialism), but
in this process, [everyone trades away their innocence to some extent] (naivety).

So, that's why people constantly ask themselves "What's the lesser of two evils...?" (justification)

The answer...?

Well, not to make this entirely religious... but they say that [God] is either [all-knowing], or all-good
(superposition).

If that is [true], then whichever one it may be, [Satan/the devil] is the [polar opposite] (entanglement).

In my opinion, [God] is NOT all good, he is [all-knowing], because you'll never catch him off guard not
knowing what [Satan] knows. (In other words, [God]'s gonna know what's comin'... it's in his plan.)

Once you apply all this to [existentialism], you might realize that being [optimistic ALONE] is a lot
like [saying your prayers], or having [faith], or [trust] in others. (hard to do, sometimes)

Whereas being [optimistic] AND [taking action] produces [very different results].

Whereas being [pessimistic] AND [taking action] ALSO produces [very different results].

All of these things apply to [existentialism], and [psychology] in general.

The point being, being [optimistic] AND [taking action] is pretty important… but don't take action EXPECTING
certain results, because [Satan] is gonna come along and derail your plans, as that's [exactly] what a photon
does in the [double slit experiment]… the act of [observation] changes the result
(Heisenberg uncertainty principle).

/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯/
\ Corey \
/_______/

[Michael C. Cook Sr.], I think almost [everything you do produces different results].

And, your ability to [absorb information] also produces different results. (retention)

A conversation you have with anyone you can always learn SOMETHING.
And, it's always YOU that controls your actions.

It's taking [full accountability] for all of YOUR actions. (Agreed)

The thing is, however in a [social construct] such as [law] or [government], we still in some manner,
need to [obey rules] set down by our [peers]. (Agreed)

Which is respectable, because without [laws], [chaos] can generate some [dark corners]. (Agreed)

Even within [law] there are [criminal activities] that destroy lives that make living almost pointless. 
(Agreed)

Extreme examples, though. (...but it also occurs in many NOT so extreme cases, as well...)

You do [will] things into [existence]. (...for the most part, but that's debatable)

The problem is always [time]. (There are many other problems, but [time] IS a core component.)

How much [time] something takes, is the [key to success], in anything... and [time] is always against you.
([People] are ALSO against each other, but I'll capitalize on that later.)

It's the key to almost everything you do, and all options change each day or month that passes.

People say that you always have time. (Not necessarily.)

But, the [truth] is, you can die at any moment for any reason with reason. (Agreed)

So, the [optimism] for me, comes from the fact that [I believe in myself] to make the [best decisions],
and I accept that I will fail along the way. (Agreed)

There is no reason NOT to fail also, since most of almost all we do as individuals is blind.
(Failure is a key component of success, being willing to fail over and over until success.
"I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work." -Thomas Edison)

You can [Batman] anything, and study the shit out of something that is within reason, since you can't
study something that [newly discovered] unless you yourself are fielding an expertise in it.
(More on that later, I intend to apply that to the professors listed above.)

So, being an [optimistic existentialist] to me, means that life is clearly about your choices.
And you can, in fact, make both [good] and [bad] choices. (Everybody makes mistakes.) 

You DO control the choices you make (to some extent), but it's not without the understanding that
you are influenced by your environment. And, you will be mostly making choices in naievity. 

But- you make choices. (Sometimes there is just the ILLUSION of choice.)

I believe in the [nature] vs [nurture] debate, that it's ALWAYS going to be a mix of both.

Humans are not born with survival skills.
We just die as an infant, without care.
(Hence why I brought up mentorship.)

So, as we are taught, we are [influenced]... and ONLY when we are capable of being more than that,
can we truly make a decision freely. (Perhaps, but that depends.)

So, we DO have free will... (Supposedly, [Robert Sopolsky] makes a great case that we don't.)
We can rebel to [ALL] systems applied to us. ([Noam Chomsky] makes this case as well.)

But ultimately, our choices are influenced within a [spectrum] of what we ourselves claim as [individuality].

We are in fact, a [tribal species]. (Falls under [the human condition])

We do [better] in groups, and the loners that claim self made are always lying. 
We are no one without [guidance] and [help] from others...including any corporate structure. (Not necessarily.)

That's why when OTHERS stand on [mounds of gold], they usually tend to hopefully thank those who got them there.

([Jeremy Rifkin] makes this case as well, perhaps in a utopian society that would be fun and well... but the
reality is that there's no consistency in that outlook. Look at how much profit many companies are making
versus the average cost of living, [Walmart] is a perfect example of a company that is raking in billions in
profits, and the workforce is one of the largest dependents on wellfare, SNAP, and other state-issued benefits.
[John Stewart] talks about this with [Jane Yellen]. https://youtu.be/3r76KkcJaTE)

The deepest of thoughts usually come from the fact that people think they're [inherently good], and that evil
is some sort of choice. (People are in denial to think that they're [inherently good].)

But if you study [criminal psychology], you'll clearly see how crazy some of their environments (are/were),
and how easily human beings can be [influenced] to do horrible things to each other.
(Falls under [the human condition], [lack of empathy], [societal expecations], [general psychology])

We DO control, and have [free will]... but it's also a double-edged sword, because we are not gods.
([Robert Sopolsky] makes the case that we don't have [free will]...)

We are [flawed], like all life.
Nothing is absolutely perfect.

But no matter what has happened, you can take [full accountability] for [your actions],
once you are fully aware.

I call it ascension of the mind. ([Corey], capitalize on what this means.)

[Purpose] is given to us by [knowledge]. (Much less [knowledge], much more [wisdom])

Seeking to become more than our animalistic selves, is what allows us to become free. (Consciousness) 

We can be savage, no doubt.
But- we can be much more also. (We CAN be, but observations of people contradict that to a large degree.)

And only in that path, can you truly have an understanding of why it's best to always own your actions.

It sucks when you realize you're the bad guy in your story. (<- explain)
It's a hard swallow. But it's also the most important part in growing.

You have to become more than those who came before you.
(I think that may be a flaw in [the human condition] to think that is [possible]... but- if that's what
motivates us, sure.) But within human limits.

I guess you could discover forever youth, or some sort of crazy eternal thinking.
But- the (1) absolute we ALL know is, we die. 

So like [Gandalf] said:

=================================================================================
| All we have to decide, is what to do with the time that is given us. -Gandalf |
=================================================================================

/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯/
\ Michael \
/_________/

[Corey E Betz], it's clear that you're definitely a [critical thinker], which is [really good].

Too many people lack the (ability/desire) to [express] their (train of thought/line of reasoning) at great
detail like you just did, and THAT is the reason why so many things are devolving into chaos.
(And I think the [hesitation] to do so, or the [disposition] people have, or the [general taboo] of doing
so, is pushed down onto people in order to eradicate their ability to freely express themselves without
fear of [persection] or [retaliation].)

I think that comes down to the way (the education system/society in general) sort of causes people to feel
[compelled] to (keep their commentary to a minimum/be concise), or to think that it's bad to talk about these
concepts at great length, for fear of (peer discouragement/alienation/exclusion).

That said, at some point I'm gonna unpack everything you said, because many statements you made,
I couldn't agree more.

Problem is, many statements you made could use a little clarification.
Not necessarily on your end, but society's end. (I'll capitalize on this, shortly)

"Why are things the way they are...?"
Or,
"Why are things society accepts as normal, normal...?"

Society can be [reprogrammed], but it requires individuals to [stop accepting the way things have always
been done], and to [start having a discussion] about what's [fair], or how things SHOULD be done...

...and this process continues to be [institutionalized] through [government], [religion], and et cetera,
but the [scientific method] constantly causes these areas to require an [update].

[Society makes a lot of assumptions]. (That's due to [the human condition].)

You're right about how some people truly believe they are [inherently good] 
(...as well as many other things that I'd like to quote...).

That's (naivety), though that ranges in a [spectrum], because in some cases, that's (malice).

I will expand on this at some point when I can sort of [document] what you wrote, and compare it to some of my
[statements] and [research].

My point being, you're [quite aware] and [on point] with your [rhetoric]. But- it's worth asking WHY many of
your points are on point. (Philosophy and existentialism.)

Most important point you made...
[Taking action], that is [critical].

/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯/
\ Corey \
/_______/

[Michael C. Cook Sr.], I been in debates my whole life against all sorts of stances, because I actually wanted
to [understand meaning]. (Good, because a lot of people don't even bother.)

Not just meaning in life, but meaning behind almost ALL actions. Which... in the grand scheme of things,
is crazy.
(Life is crazy...? I can agree with that.)

That's so much.
So, when people sit around being [lazy] (sloth, (1) of the seven deadly sins) not believing there is anything
new to learn in the world... I'm over in my corner always [reading], [discussing] and [debating] things.

However, as I've gotten older, I've learned the art of getting to the point without being [conflictive] or
[disrespectful] towards others. (Sometimes you HAVE to be... and the instution thoroughly discourages that.)

But, that doesn't matter, people will take offense to [anything] and if I [alienate] some ignorant individuals
along the way, so be it. (Capitalize on this, because treating people as if they're [disposable] allows the
cycle to persist, and causes society to be unable to heal itself, which is covered in [The Social Dilemma].)

/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯/
\ Michael \
/_________/

[Corey E Betz] Yeah, that's good.

Part of what you just said relates to the [(7) deadly sins], particularly [sloth].

[Sloth] is [laziness].

You're right, there is [always something to learn] about something, but the [education system] causes people
to think [critically] about [SUBJECTS] that pertain to [wealth], [fame], and [success]... it does NOT cause
people to think critically about [CONCEPTS] or [principles], such as [morality], [ethics], [right] and [wrong],
and et cetera. (Which is the point of [existentialism] and [philosophy] in general.)

The [education system] teaches people about 1) people, 2) places, and 3) things, and it often fails to teach
people about [principles] or [concepts]. (I'll capitalize on this later.)

Like, does the [education system] teach kids at school that if you have a lot of [money] and you throw it at a
[politician], that's called a [bribe].

But- if it is a [significant enough amount of money], it becomes [lobbying].
(I.E. [Blackrock], [Vanguard], [Central Bank Public-Private Partnership], etc.)

No, the [education system] does not teach little kids about [THAT], if anything, it causes kids to think
that sounds [very ridiculous], and if it were happening, then the police would've arrested them by now for
doing that.

Yeah right. (LOL)

The [education system] spams the shit out of kids with [subjects] that aren't [sophisticated enough] to staple
together a [reasonable argument] about [corruption]...

That's what I've noticed anyway, the [dichotomy] of so many things, treating [common themes] or [overlapping
subjects] as if they're [completely separate].

That's why [analogies] and [metaphors] are [pretty powerful tools] to [teach people stuff].
In the end, the [education system] teaches people to worry about [money first], and [people later].
"@)

$Doc.Add("Discernment",@"
So, now that I've covered the post, some prerequisites for some of my arguments and counterpoints, as well
as where I've agreed...

I'm going to cover some additional concepts that aren't in the document so far.

I've stated multiple times that there are other factors that lead to people in society acting and feeling
the way that they do, and a lot of this comes down to lack of general, all-around care regarding individuals,
and that there is a very clear and observable level of control that people are expected to abide by, which
circumvents every citizens constitutional rights, liberties and freedoms, and a lot of that comes from...

[The British Monarchy].

I've written about how the [British Monarchy] still has a lot of influence and control over our society
many, many times before, because they just couldn't let [America] win after the [American Revolutionary War].

Some people will flat out argue with me till they're blue in the face, but I'll make this argument right
here and now. There are a lot of laws that limit people's first amendment constitutional right to freely
express themselves, particularly regarding [decency], [libel], [defamation], [obscenity], and things
of that nature.

But also, I like to use the analogy of how a canine can smell a drug or substance even if it is packed
tightly or whatever... The police use drug canines to sniff the presence of drugs, and even if the
substance is unable to be detected by a human nose, the canine's nose is able to detect the smell of
drugs through many materials, like metal, glass, or et cetera.

The analogy is this.

Sometimes, people can detect when someone is bullshitting them, not unlike when the dogs smell the
drugs. [John Stewart] and even [Russell Brand] talk a lot about how the taxpayers paid for things like
the [COVID] vaccine, which the pharmaceutical companies were given, and they made the vaccine, and
then they made record profits off of that taxpayer money.

The [F-35] program is another candid example of how taxpayer money is being... for lack of a better
term, WASTED, and... all (50) states have been making parts for the god damn plane which is billions
of dollars over budget, years behind schedule, and provides less than satisfactory returns on the
investment.

Then you also have the amount of weapons, ammunition, goods, bombs, ordinances, tanks, helicopters,
vehicles, construction, armaments, and other military objects that were commandeered by the Taliban
after the evacuation of [Afghanistan], to which the taxpayers shelled out over $1T in the (20) years
that we were in the country fighting the terrorists there.

There's a lot of cases to be made that the government is intentionally wasting people's money, AND,
they come up with the most brilliant excuses to continue to do so, sometimes using [Barack Obama]'s
rhetoric [Too Big To Fail].

Here's the idea I'm attempting to capitalize on.

Our government wastes taxpayer money intentionally, in many cases.

The banks use fractional reserve lending to provide themselves with interest that the normal, regular
average citizen doesn't have access to, and it in turn, causes people in society to feel stressed out,
and to feel as if their life lacks meaning...

...leading to my argument of them questioning their existence... and [existentialism].

What is the point of the average citizen going to work, paying their bills that are already outrageous
to begin with, so that some rich dude somewhere can splurge the profits they make on whatever amentities
they desire, meanwhile... most people are struggling to make ends meet, they're getting denied benefits,
some of the benefits people currently get are being written off or even outright refused, and even
[John Stewart] AND [John Oliver] have capitalized on how disgraceful some government spending truly is.

We live in a dystopia. We are supposed to have this idea of democracy, but from my vantage point, too
many people are getting screwed over because they're not even ALLOWED to know about many of these 
programs, and really... I don't blame every politician for things being the way that they are...

I blame the lobbyists and central bank to a large extent, because a lot of that has been institutionalized
by the [British Monarchy].

Here's how that works.

Someone wants to buy (10K) shares of [Microsoft].

When they submit the request to buy (10K) shares of [Microsoft] at a certain price, the traders
go ahead and they purchase the (10K) shares of [Microsoft], and they then scrape a certain percentage
of those trades off of the top, and then they resell them in [microseconds]. This in turn causes
the (10K) worth of shares to inflate up to a higher price, which could result in (7K) shares being
bought by the customer.

It sounds stupid, right...?
Well, that's what they do.

They buy the shares since they're handling the purchasers money, and then they do the same sort of
thing that [Sam Bankman-Fried] did when he ran the [FTX] cryptocurrency exchange, in some cases
making illegal trades and things of that nature…

But- the amount of time that this happens is [microseconds].
There's no way to regulate what's going on there, because it is so complicated and happening at such a
high rate of speed, nobody knows what the hell is going on except the traders.

Now, compound that issue across the board, government, Wall Street, corporations, industries...

[Microsoft] wouldn't be the victim there, they're getting paid one way or another.

The traders get their cut in such a small window of time, it's essentially like when the [British]
made the [American colonists] pay for the bullshit tea, leading to the [Boston Tea Party].

If this is happening all across the board, and the [World Bank Public Private Partnership] 
[https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/], [Blackrock], [Vanguard], and others are
involved in lobbying government officials, getting them into office and stuff...

You have a system in place that is protecting [thievery] at the highest levels.

Now, that's going to cause problems everywhere in society, and some of those problems manifest themselves
as a digital frankenstein terraforming the world in it's image, like what was stated in [The Social Dilemma].

The education system does not teach little kids about how this system commits systematic extortion,
and the entire system is rigged to a large extent to the point where it is REALLY COMPLICATED to try and
tackle any singular aspect of this problem.

The problem is likely to worsen.
The problem ALSO applies to [global warming].
The problem ALSO applies to people's mental health, and well being.
The problem ALSO applies to people's actions in life, as well as their opportunities.

$Doc.Add("Conclusion",@"
SOME of these problems are addressed by the [professors] I had mentioned, albeit in their own ways.

I don't think that any (1) person out there is able to get a grasp on the [full scope and severity] of
how it directly affects every living person in the United States, as well as other countries, but it
ALSO affects [wildlife], [biosphere], [environment], [water cycles], [business], [trade], [industry],
IDK.

Saying that [everybody is responsible for their own decisions] is a bit of a naive outlook, because
the system institutionalizes what I call [modern slavery], which (indirectly + directly) influences
their [available decisions], or their [illusion of choice].

This [modern slavery] takes opportunities away from the [average citizen], and even though we DO have
[control] over our own decisions to [some extent]...?

There are people out there sort of establishing a level of control that ... I don't really know how
else to explain, without covering several novels worth of information and topics that I don't have a
PhD in.

Luckily, I’ve already specified some of the [professors] who have.
