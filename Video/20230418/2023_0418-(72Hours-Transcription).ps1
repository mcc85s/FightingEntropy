:Audio log Monday, [April 17th, 2023].
Michael Cook speaking, it is currently [11:05pm].

I'm making this audio recording to talk about the uh court appearance on [April 19th],
that uh- it's comin' up quick.

And the reason why I wanna talk about it is because, I have strong objections 
to the entire process at the court, since uh- [June 28th, 2022].

Right, and so, my [strong objections], they [indicate] that I can have an [audio recording]
that [directly contradicts my mother's statement], and [the police don't care about that], 
the [lawyers don't care about that].
The [judge doesn't care about that].

Nah, if anything- including the uh- psychiatrists that the- the judge ordered me to go see...?
[Dr. Gurbek] and [Dr. Glosman]...?

They don't care about the [audio recording], and how it [incriminates my mother].
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:01:17","00:01:59",@'
:Right...?

What it does, is it [proves that I'm innocent] because uh-
half of the things that my mother stated in her statement...?

They are [proven false], with the [audio recording] and the [transcription] that I made.

Unfortunately, the people that I rattled off, they don't care about that.

They don't care that my mother committed- [knowingly made false statements]
in order to have me [arrested].

[Do you wanna know why they don't care]...?
Is because, uh- this is how the [system] is [designed].
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:01:59","00:02:41",@'
:If they had to care about [every bit] of [evidence] that [proves someone's innocence]...?
Then that means they would have to [work harder].

[They don't wanna work that hard].
They wanna do the [bare minimum], and that's why they're saying that I'm [incompetent] to
[stand trial]. That's what I think about judge Joe Fedora. Or, Fodera.

Is that uh- [I'm not incompetent to stand trial], what I think is that
[someone is committing obstruction of justice].

And I think that it's [the judge].
In addition to [Michael Depresso].
(In addition to [Andrew C. Blumenberg])

In addition to the [(2) doctors] that the [judge] sent me to go see.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:02:41","00:03:29",@'
:Now, suppose that I'm [wrong], and they're NOT committing [obstruction of justice], why
is it that [every single time] that I [bring up] the [existence] of the [audio recording], 
and how my [constitutional rights] were, uh- [violated]...?

[During] the [arrest]...?
And [afterward]...?

Why does the [judge] continue to uh- like, uh- [in each court transcription], uh- he's
made it [very clear to me] that he [doesn't] want to [hear anything] about the [case]...?

Because, ya know, like uh- [he's made it very clear to me] that the- the details of the
case DON'T have to be [discussed] at the [courtroom].

What [CAN] be [discussed], is the [punishments] that I'm gonna [undergo].
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:03:29","00:04:37",@'
:Because that's what the ju- that's what the system [FEELS] like doing.
It doesn't [FEEL] like [reviewing the audio recording].
It doesn't [FEEL] like uh- [charging my mother with perjury].

It doesn't [FEEL] like [upholding the law].
It [FEELS] like [breaking the law], in order to [incriminate me], and to cause my 
[reputation] to be [tanked considerably]... because they- they only care about how
things [LOOK].

They don't really give a shit about how things [are], unless it's really
[obvious] for [OTHER PEOPLE].

So if I have an [audio recording] that s- that like, uh- very specifically uh- 
reveals that my mother made a number of false statements to 
[Sara Derusso], what'll happen is that [Joe Fedora] will send me to
uh- doctors, that will uh- ignore the audio recording, which means
that they do this to other people as well.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:04:37","00:05:04",@'
:And they don't do this to EVERYBODY, because I think it reall does matter
how someone [LOOKS]. What I mean by like, how someone [LOOKS] is their
[appearance]. I think that people's [appearance], uh- directly, uh- is
able to uh- determine whether or not like, people give a shit.

[Someone's appearance].

Facts don't matter, what matters is how people [APPEAR].
So if someone's really good looking, they're never gonna face the same
level of uh- uh- resistance that I've been facing.

Do you wanna know why...?
It's because when people LOOK at me, they don't like what they see.
Nah, they don't like some dude, like me, who looks really stupid, but
isn't stupid... when I open my mouth and I talk, right...?
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:05:04","00:06:01",@'
:So what happens is uh- people that are a lot less intelligent than me,
they feel like, uh- throwing their weight around, and that's exactly
whats been happening at the [Town of Halfmoon].

So like, what I mean is this... like [Bruce Tanski] can go around and
commit bank fraud, and uh- submit fraudulent uh- bank applications and
stuff...?

Well, I dunno. But um- ya know, further to that point, what I'd like
to say is uh- ya know, like uh- I have [thought] about this from like, 
literally [every angle], and uh- it's just gonna inve- it's just gonna
require [too much of my time] to try to [fight it].

Right...?
Like, I have cond- I have uh- [very damning evidence], but, so long
as they just [mismark me] and they just [ignore it]...?

Then, the [evidence doesn't matter].
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:06:50","00:07:33",@'
:What [matters] is what they think.
And [if what they think is wrong]...?

[Oh well], I have to [deal] with [that].
[That's the way they see it].

So, like I said, [it doesn't matter what the facts are],
what matters is how they [FEEL].

What matters is what they [PERCEIVE]...
And if they [FEEL] like saying that the [evidence] that I have is not
important...?

[Then, that's what they're gonna do].

[They've made that very clear to me], that that is what they [FEEL] like doing,
so like if I go into the courtroom, and like I uh- vent my frustrations with the
judge, about how I think that maybe HE'S the one that's [incompetent] to 
[stand trial], or to [PROVIDE] a trial...

$T.X(0,"00:07:33","00:08:31",@'
:Well, then I'm gonna be- I'm gonna be [sent to jail], for [contempt].
Right...? 

So, if I do [ANYTHING] that [upsets the judge], like if I [LOOK] at the
[judge] the [wrong way]... that's gonna be, that's gonna be [contempt]
right there.

So, [it doesn't matter what the facts are], what matters is, some dude 
that's in charge, uh- he can just [do whatever the hell he wants to].

So [if he looks pretty fuckin' ridiculous], like when uh- I uh- allow
[other people] to [review] the [audio recording] and the [transcription],
and then like, at some point...?

Like, someone [WILL] be able to [read the transcription] [line by line],
and then they'll be able to [read the court transcriptions] with uh- me
being at the [Halfmoon Town Court], and then like, maybe I AM [delusional]
to think that someone's ever gonna give a shit about like, [reading all of
those transcriptions].
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:08:31","00:09:16",@'
:And being able to [determine] that like, ya know, [all of my predictions]
about the [court process] at the [Town of Halfmoon] have come to pass...

Well, I think what it really all comes down to is, like...
[who gives a shit]...?
Right...?

So, like, they wanna [determine] that like, I'm not gonna be a- that 
[I'm not gonna hurt anybody], right...? 

(^ They're [forcing me] to be a [pacifist] that just [rolls over], 
and [allows them] to [have their fucking way]. Nah, [I don't fuckin' think so].)

So what they want- they want me to [say something] along the lines of like uh-
so like, [if someone attacks me], I'm just supposed to [take that]...?

And then they're gonna say:
[Them]: Yes, [you are supposed to take that].
        You're [not] supposed to like, [defend yourself].
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:09:16","00:09:50",@'
:That is like, how these people have been [thinking] and [reacting].
[It's NOT ok to defend yourself].
[It's not ok to tell the truth]...
[It's not ok to like, provide evidence to the courtroom]...

[All of these things are gonna sound really fuckin' stupid] to like,
[anybody] who like uh- [believes] that they have [rights] and stuff...?

But, [these are the things that've been happening to me] at the 
[Town of Halfmoon] court, since [June 28th, 2022].

as well as my [testimony], but they [chose] to [be pretty gay] and [arrested]
me [after] I told them about the [recording (which proves my innocence)]

That's the part where I think that [Joe Fodera] is making a [concious choice]

04/05/22 | Dr. Reilly | https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aNBYW3iBKJ9SkdfnCeL2aTp5oHCXtnqu

A conversation that I recorded speaking to [Dr. Reilly] from
[Saratoga County Mental Health] about a year before the last
appearance I had with [Joe Fodera] on [04/05/2023].

It's interesting, right...?
I continue to make these [multiple statements] about how some people at
[Saratoga County] are fuckin' morons... and [they do absolutely nothing] 
to [change their behaviors].

Essentially what that is, is me, telling some dude name [Dr. Reilly],
that I intend to file a fucking lawsuit against [Saratoga County].

Much in the same manner to how the people at [Saratoga Hospital] act, uh-
the dude doesn't seem to be all that convinced nor really worried about a
god damn thing. 
Why...?

Uh- because apparently you need to have [money] to file a [successful lawsuit].

Not only are [they are aware of this], but- [they like to exploit it], too.

They know that [someone] can have [thousands] of [very convincing exhibits], but so
long as they [act really retarded] in [unison]...? [None of those exhibits matter].

[This conversation] is the [typical conversation] that [mental health professionals]
tend to have with me, where I never once had [schizophrenia] for the first (36) years
of my life, but oh my god...

Shockingly, [once I started my company] and started [doing research] into national
security programs, and [corruption in the government] and [everywhere else]
[breaking laws], and [committing crimes], and [lying to people] unimpeded...?

Oh, NOW I [must] have [schizophrenia]. Yeah.
That's the [actual thought process] of this [stupid cunt]
at [Saratoga County Mental Health], [Dr. Gurbek].

I just apparently masked it incredibly fucking well that whole time.
Or, [some people are fucking stupid], and they [deserve] to be [shot to death]
by a [deranged lunatic] like [Stephen Paddock].

I'm going to make this perfectly clear, like I did at the fucking interview that
I had with these fucking morons at [Saratoga County Mental Health], I think about
hurting people quite often because they ignore the shit that I say, but that
doesn't mean that I have those [intentions]. I explicitly stated that I do not
have those intentions. But [they're stupid].

When I talk to them about the AUDIO RECORINGS that I've recorded...?

It's strange, this useless cunt [Dr. Gurbek] asked me if I [recorded] the [conversation]
that I had with [her] and [Dr. Glosman], and when I said "No.", that's when they made
the decision to [do something fucking stupid].

If it's a [COURT] that's [recording the audio]...?
That's [literally important], and it is [top of the line], [most official].

If it's an [INDIVIDUAL] that's [recording the audio]...?
That's [literally fucking stupid], and it's [practically illegal to do].

That is the attitude that [Dr. Gurbek] had when she asked me if I recorded
the conversation that I had with her and [Dr. Glosman] on [02/23/2023 1300].

[That's what mental health professionals do].
Sometimes.
At least when they're far less skilled than [Samuel Bastian], who works at
that fucking clinic, and gave me an evaluation in the past.

I WAS scheduled to see HIM and some other doctor, but the cool thing is
that [the people at the court] and [the people at the clinic]...
...[they play games with people].

What do I mean...?

Well, at the court interaction on [01/18/22] with [George Conway], the judge
made a [sly joke] where he poked fun at [George Conway].

Basically, [George Conway] said "I'm gonna need a mental health evaluation."
He was saying that in respect to me, needing the evaluation.

And then the judge, with a stupid fuckin' look on his face, he's like:
[Fodera]: Oh I thought you meant YOU needed a mental health evaluation~!

And then everybody in the courtroom laughed in a similar manner to how
sitcoms would force the audience to laugh at something fuckin' stupid,
and this process is called 'canned laughter'. It's called 'canned laughter'
because it's literally [fake laughter] that is [recorded] and [saved for later].

They were calling for my [mental health evaluation], and then the judge
jokingly applied the need for a mental health evaluation at [George Conway]...

It was meant to be a light hearted, jokey mcfuntime at court...
being [cool guy 5000 Fodera], wearin' his fuckin' sunglasses indoors.
Sounds stupid, right...?
Yeh, that's cause it is.

But I have news for ya, everything about this whole court interaction has been a
bit of a fuckin' joke. Same goes with the arrest, same goes with the bullshit
[730 hearing], same goes with the [treatment] I've been getting from people in
the community, particularly [Joe Cannistracci], [Neil Golub] and [Michael Philipsak]. 

Yeah, all of these things are more fuckin' stupid than that dumbass joke [Joe Fodera]
made about [George Conway] needing a mental health evaluation.

Oh, by the way, when the judge cracked that joke, [George Conway] looked at the order, 
and then he said to the judge:
[Conway]: Hey, you filled this out incorrectly...

Then that's when [Joe Fodera] had to use the white out strip, and then write
the [correct date] on the form. 

By the way, the form that [Joe Fodera] gave me and filled out was the
[incorrect form]. Yeah.

It's almost like they can all do everything wrong, over and over again, make stupid
fucking jokes, ignore evidence, and just treat me however they fucking feel like, 
and they get paid to do this.

That's what I call "incompetence".

[Joe Fodera] wrote the order on the [incorrect fucking form] after he joked about
[George Conway] needing the evaluation. 

That's what the woman at [Saratoga County Mental Health] said to me when I rode
my bike up there to schedule the appointment, on [Friday 01/20/23].

I know that's the [correct date], because when I went there, the woman said:
[SCMH]: Hey, they filled out the wrong form...
[Me]  : Oh yeh...?
[SCMH]: Yeh, we don't do these a lot.
        Anyway, I contacted the court, apparently they left for the day.
        They're gonna get back to me with the [correct form].
[Me]  : *checks watch* It's only like [2 o'clock]...?
[SCMH]: Oh I know, trust me.
        They probably do not work very hard at the court.
        If [Bruce Tanski] can get away with bank fraud...?
        Then, I dunno dude.
        Maybe that's why they just leave before [2 o'clock].
        We'll wait to hear back from them.
        Your lawyer will be in touch with you.
[Me]  : Ok.

Then I left...
Then, I contacted them on [01/25/23], and apparently the same woman I spoke to
in person, she was able to get on the phone and told me:
[SCMH]: Yeah, so, we've gotten in touch with the court.
        Don't you worry about it, everything is being hashed out.
        When the appointment is scheduled, your lawyer will let you know.
        Take care.

And then, my lawyer did NOT get in touch with me...
And then I called [George Conway], from [5184068569] at [Market 32] in 
[Shoppers World Plaza] on [02/01/2023 1358] and left him a [voicemail]...

And then I waited until [02/10/23] to call [George Conway] again...
And then he said that I missed my appointment.
Shucks.

He stated that I [must've] gotten an [email] that had the [appointment time].
I can't remember if he said that he got my [voicemail].

But he definitely said that I [should've gotten the email] that had the
appointment time. Except... nah. This is not the first time that the public
defenders office has miscommunicated with me. I'm not blaming [George Conway].

I used this thing called "the same fucking [Google] account that I uploaded
the audio recording that I recorded on 06/28/22 of my mother and I having the
altercation that proves my innocence" to access my "email"...

And what I found after using this other thing called the "search box"...
...was that [at no point whatsoever], did [anybody] from the public defenders
office make [any attempt] to [inform me] of the [appointment].

This is after [Saratoga County Mental Health] told me on (2) separate
occasions that [the lawyer would be in touch with me].

Nah, I'm pretty sure that they dropped the ball.

Further to that point, [Samuel Bastian], the guy that I met with BEFORE, who 
evaluated me for about (3) hours, he was assigned to the appointment that neither
[Saratoga County Mental Health], nor  [Saratoga County Public Defenders] office 
made a single effort to inform me about...

...because I didn't have any [voicemails] or [emails] about the [appointment].

[This is a running theme with the court system] as well as various "experts" 
or "professionals" that I have to constantly put up with.

I'm using "air quotes" because sometimes people have a job to do,
and they're fucking lousy at it.

[Did someone fail to do their job correctly]...?
[Yes]...?
Oh, ok.

[Who pays the consequences for that]...?
[Not them]...?
[Someone else]...?
Oh, ok.

So, that's effectively a form of [tyranny] and [oppression] right there.

[That's probably why mass shootings are pretty common in the United States], 
believe it or not. 

In many cases, these "mistakes" aren't "mistakes"... it's called [corruption].
And, it's fucking [rampant].

Right, I'd like, to have the [opportunity], to [show the evidence] to 
[another courtroom], and uh- you know, like uh- what'll happen is this...

Right, if I- if I invest a lot of [energy] into doing that...?

What'll happen is that, like, [some people], they get to [ride around] on their
uh- [reputation]. They get to [rest on their laurels].

So, uhm- [a lot of people will find my story hard to believe],
even though like, I have evidence of it...

And then, like, what'll happen is uh- ya know, anybody that [does] believe me, 
they're gonna like, [make up excuses for the whole entire process].

So like, in the [beginning] and the [end], like, it's fucking- it's [futile].

...and that's it. 

Ya know...?

[I could be wrong about this to some degree]...?
But- as long as I say it [very boldly] and [loudly], right...?

Like, [at some point], some people are gonna [see the sense] in like, uh-
the number of things that I've [said], and like how uh- all the things that
I recorded back in (2020) until now...?

Like, it [painted this picture] that like, our country...?
[Has a lot of stupid fuckin'- people in it].
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:16:18","00:16:47",@'
:And, uh- ya know, whether it's like a [robot drone/bird] that I recorded in
an [audio recording], or [multiple]...? Or, maybe it IS a [mockingbird].

What I can say with [god damn certainty], is that [not a single god damn person]
has had a fuckin' [discussion] about [that-] those [audio recordings] that I
[recorded] at length, right...? (only [arguments] from [morons] who [don't listen]
to  it, but still, they'll [insist] that their [argument] is [correct].)

Because they're [making an assumption] that I'm fuckin' [stupid], and that like,
the things that I [recorded]...? They're [nonsense].
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:16:47","00:17:33",@'
:Right...?
[And these are the things that cause me to think violent thoughts].
About people.

It's like, well... you know, uh- there probably is something MORE to what I
recorded, than it JUST being a fucking bird...? But- sometimes people PROVE
that they're really fuckin' stupid when uh- they uh- they try to [argue] with
[someone like me].

When I make a much more [valiant effort] to [sound more educated] and like,
[more thought out] than [most people]...?

But- [people will still argue with me]...

And the [reason] they do it, is because like, they think that- eh, the 
[better looking] you are, the be- the [more important] of a [person] you are. 

Or, the [more money] you [make], the [more important] of a [person] you are.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:17:33","00:18:09",@'
:I mean, that's- that's the [beginning] and the [end] of it.

Like, when it comes to [intelligence], p- [some people are pretty stupid], and 
they think that that's a [matter of opinion].

And uh- they don't have the [ability] to [pull their heads out of their asshole],
to like, experience like, the [definition] of the [word].

Like, [intelligence].
It's when, you can [compare things], and you can [accurately determine] the 
[difference] between [one thing] and [another].

So, a lot of people...?

They didn't get to be [rich] because they're [intelligent]...
They got to be [pretty rich] because of [who] they [know].
And [that's it].
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:18:09","00:18:53",@'
:And there's [a lot of people in our society] that are like [that].
They got to where they are because of [WHO] they are, not because of [WHAT]
they know.

Because what they know, it- it's not like, [difficult], to know what they know...
...in terms of [a lot of people in society], I'm not sayin' that [everybody] is
like that.

Right...?
These are [reasons] why I don't like, try to have a [conversation] with [people], 
like really anymore.

Because like, uh- I dunno. Heh.

Because like, people fuckin' argue with me.
[CONSTANTLY].

Ya know...?
It seems like uh- 
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:18:53","00:19:33",@'
:I have a [better relationship] with this fuckin' uh- dude that shows up at the
library, he just like sits next to me, where- where like I sit...?

And, uh- he- he's like:
[Fred]: Hey, how's it goin'...?

I'm like:
[Me]  : Hey, how's it goin'...?

And then, like, [we don't talk to each other all that much].

But like, ya know, like, we have a [mutual understanding] where like, ya know, 
uh- sometimes I'll be like:
[Me]: Hey, sorry I didn't say hello when you showed up the other day.

He's like:
[Fred]: Nah nah nah, it's fine.
        I don't care.
        Ah- it's- ya know...?
        It's whatever.

Right...?
And like, having like uh- a relationship with uh- somebody that fuckin'
like doesn't like to talk to people...
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:19:33","00:20:03",@'
:Uh- uh- all that- all that mu- well...
I don't wanna say-

He probably does talk with people, and he does enjoy talking with people,
but like- the [very bare minimum], is that like, ya know [he's not gonna bother me].

And I like that.

Because most people in society, they're pr- [fucking pretty annoying].

And like, when I say that [most people in society are pretty fuckin' annoying],
what I mean is like, a lot of people believe in uh- the [cliches], or like uh-
the [way] that like, [society] is [supposed to be].
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:20:03","00:21:17",@'
:The way that [society] is [SUPPOSED to be].
You're [supposed] to have a [job]...?
You're [supposed] to like, [pay your bills]...
You're [supposed] to like, [not argue with the bills] that you're [supposed to pay]...

So [if you get screwed over and scammed]...?
[Oh well].

[That's what you're supposed to do], to [take part of society].

So like, if fuckin' uh- [Spectrum] and [Verizon] have a- a [monopoly] in the
town of [Clifton Park], right...? And then like, if I go around like, saying
that for a while...?

And like, I explain what the [monopoly] [IS]...?

Some people who are really stupid, they'll assume that like, I'm [psychotic].

For thinking that like, [Verizon] and [Spectrum] have like a working relationship,
where like, [Spectrum] can corner the market, and they could like be the only
broadband provider in the town of [Clifton Park], and then like, what'll happen
is that ALL the people in [Clifton Park], that think that like, I'm crazy...

Like, uh, [they're payin' a lot of money for their internet]...
And their [internet provider] is [stomping on the fucking speed and quality], and
the [spread of information] in the area.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:21:17","00:21:55",@'
:Meanwhile, fuckin' [Verizon] is making a lot more money off the lines.
So like, that's what I mean by like, people are just really fuckin' stupid...
And like, ya know...?

[I'm the one that's incompetent to stand trial].
And like, my mother...?
She can lie to the [State Police] to have me arrested...
Like she did on [June 28th, 2022]...?

And nobody's gonna do a god damn thing about it~!

Do you wanna know why...?
It's because people like [Dr. Grosman], er- [Dr. Glosman] and [Dr. Gurbek]
are fuckin' stupid, too.

Yeah.
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:21:55","00:22:56",@'
:Nah, it's like, at some point, some people are gonna hear like, my rhetoric,
right...? And they're gonna realize that like, I have a lot of strong points,
and [I'm not fuckin' stupid].

Right...?
Oh.

Maybe like, uh- by making these [audio recordings], I'm making it pretty clear,
that uh- [I think that some people are fuckin' stupid], and [I'm not one of em].

Right...?
Do I think [everybody] is [stupid]...?
No...?

But- like, [I judge people] based on their [actions]. 
Much less their [words].

So like, if I go to the court, and I say to the judge:
[Me]: [You're committing obstruction of justice] by like, having me go to these
      fuckin' quacks that you sent me to... to prevent the [audio recording] from
      making it into the courtroom.
      Right...?

And he's gonna say something along the lines of like:
[Fodera]: I would never do that~!

And like, "Well, [actions speak louder than words]."

And then like, he'll be like:
[Fodera]: Oh- well, now that's basically [contempt] right there,
          you're sayin' that [actions speak louder than words]...?
          You're tryin' to [speak up] for your [constitutional rights]...?
          Nah nah nah, that's [contempt].
          You're gettin' [(20) days in jail], just like judge [Paul Pelagalli]
          sentenced you to...
'@)

$T.X(0,"00:22:56","00:23:37",@'
:For like, you know, [indicating], for [indicating] that like, the [court order]
that [HE wrote], was [IMPOSSIBLE to follow].

That's what judge [Paul Pelagalli] ordered me to fuckin' [(20) days] in the
county jail for.
Right...?

And then like [Lisa Mentes]...?
Like, she submitted the fuckin' like uh- [Facebook] post that I wrote, like,
to the courtroom to get me in trouble.

Do you wanna know why she did that...?
It's because she's a fuckin' cunt.

Yeah.
So like, it's not just my [mother], it's also [Lisa Mentes],
it's also her daughter, right...?

It's also like [a bunch of other people] that are [fuckin' stupid].
Right...?
Right.
