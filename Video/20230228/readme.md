## Scientific Model

|:---------------- |:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `00:04:50`       | [Scientific Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling) |
```
What this process is called is [**`establishing`**] a [CONTROL].

This is part of a [really cool] thing that [many morons] like to ignore...

It's formally known as the:
_____________________________________________________________________

## Societal Expectations

| Time       | Name                  |
|:-----------|:----------------------|
| `00:07:02` | Societal Expectations |
```
Society forces people to believe that you'll never outgrow the box.
That's because people have a problem with determining whether their authority is CREDIBLE.

So if someone who [casually strokes their dick all day in a bathtub] happens to be in a position of IMPORTANCE
or SIGNIFICANCE, then they can literally say things that are [blatantly false], and [people will believe them].

"You'll never be able to outgrow the box."
^ What stupid people will believe when someone important tells them that.

[Importance level], in many cases, can be 100% identical to [stupidity level].  
```

## Genuinely Funny

I used to think that it came down to [not being funny], but now I know 
that [there is a group of people that work really hard] to [prevent people] 
from thinking some things are [funny], [comical], or otherwise.
    
This is called "stupid people that try to control what's funny or cool"
    
This causes many people to come across as looking [really fucking stupid] 
every time they say or do something that is [genuinely funny].

However, sometimes these morons [OVEREXTEND THAT ABILITY], and it [BACKFIRES],
whereby illuminating that someone really important is just really fucking moronic.

[Right], that's [suspicious].

Things that are considered [suspicious], are otherwise known as [clues], and the [clue] 
involves a [HALFMOON TOWN COUNCIL MEMBER NAMED ERIC CATRICALA].

They're [supposed] to teach [police officers] at the [academy] about things like [clues] and [suspicions].

Apparently they don't really need to do that anymore...?
Which is why I constantly have to tell people that the police are often times, [pretty fuckin' stupid].

## Wide-Ranging Conspiracy

| Time       | Name 
|:-----------|:------------------------|
| `00:23:30` | Wide-Ranging Conspiracy |
```
Yeah, because I was [arrested] over a [post-dated ticket] after my [iPhone 8+] was [disabled].
It was [disabled by the manufacturer, Apple Corporation] after I [showed a video] to [NYSP Shaemus Leavey] 
at [05/27/20 0900].

That video being the one I recorded outside of the [Catricala Funeral Home] from [05/25/20 2343] to [05/26/20 0004]
of [(2) dudes using a DANGEROUS ESPIONAGE TOOL DESIGNED TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET SMARTPHONES CALLED "PHANTOM"].

In that video, these [(2) dudes/queers] appeared to be right smack dab in the middle of [attempting to murder me].

Maybe there is no [wide-ranging conspiracy] at all, and it just LOOKS like [Eric Catricala had (2) different events
merged together into a single incident (3) days late, and had (0) evidence of me really doing a god damn thing].

Oh wait, [I have evidence that could corroborate HIS side of the story]...
It's just that [the evidence I have would contradict the reported time], as well as [insert the record]: 
[SCSO-2020-028501].
    
[Nothing suspicious about any of this shit in the least (sarcasm).] 

Meanwhile, [I have like dozens of fucking pictures, as well as a few AUDIO RECORDINGS], and... 
[SOMEHOW I get arrested for cutting a fucking $5.00 kayak strap at 1769 Route 9, on a post-dated ticket]. 
    
The [PHONE LINE] that [I SEVERED] because I was attempting to call 911 SOMEHOW, [NOT] being the reason for 
arresting me.

Why did I cut the phone line, is [not a question any investigator nor police officer has asked me].
I would've thought at the very least, some dude from SCSO would've approached me and been like...

[===========================================================================================================]
___________________________________________
Skit [~] You cut some dude's phone line...?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[Cop] : What the actual fuck, dude...?
[Me]  : What...?
[Cop] : So you fuckin' cut some dude's phone line, didn't ya...?
[Me]  : Well, yeh.
[Cop] : Yeah well, why the hell would you do something crazy like that...?
        You done messed up [A-A-Ron]...
[Me]  : It's cause I was trying to call (911).
[Cop] : *rolls his eyes* Buddy, everybody tries to call (911).
        *shakes head* I don't even wanna hear it, I gotta arrest you for that...

[^ what never happened.]  

[===========================================================================================================]

But I'll tell ya, cause I had attempted to call (911) (2) times during this (90) minute event where (2) dudes 
were chasing me, and trying to kill me with a car parked ahead of the (3) of us in the [Lowes] parking lot. 
[Nothing shady or suspicious going on or whatever. Not at all.]

Oh, by the way, [the (2) dudes who tried to hit me with their fucking car, nobody is going after them].

As far as I know [your deputy] [Scott Schelling] went to [Center for Security] immediately after being at the 
[SECONDARY LOCATION] in the TICKET that you gave me in this phone call, and I believe that either HE or someone
else [destroyed the evidence of me calling (911) in front of the security camera at 05/26/20 0010].

Nothing suspicious about all this shit at all. 
Nah. 
Everybody follows the law at all times. (sarcasm)

Oh and by the way, the argument that I had with my mother on [06/28/22] is about the [wide-ranging conspiracy]
I just rattled off.
Oh by the way, [Paul Pelagalli] took custody of my fuckin' children away over this whole ordeal too.
Oh by the way, people think I went insane, cause some people are just plain old fuckin' stupid and lazy.

## Nothin I Can Do

| Time       | Name 
|:-----------|:-----------------|
| `00:30:24` | Nothin' I can do |
```
That's a problem. [I called 911]. [Twice]. [My phone was hacked]. [I recorded a video of (2) dudes stalking me].

But also, if I [suspect] that the [telecommunications companies] are committing [illegal activities], then THEY can 
disrupt [any 911 call] from [making it to your dispatch station], and therefore, they have [strict control] over 
the [law enforcement system].
```

## Obstructing Justice

| Time       | Name                |
|:-----------|:--------------------|
| `00:32:24` | Obstructing Justice |
```
What about [multiple fellow officers] [obstructing justice]...?
Or the [telephony DDOS attacks]...?
[Pretty sure those are crimes, too].

MAYBE, as long as THOSE [crimes] are [committed when nobody is looking]...?
Then they're not [reportable] nor [arrestable crimes].

[So, someone can →]

[+] [destroy evidence] of [911 calls/attempted murder/vehicular manslaughter]
[~] ...as long as...
[+] [any evidence of those crimes being committed] is [destroyed] AFTER it is shown to a [police officer],
    like [NYSP Trooper Shaemus Leavey]
[~] ...which means, since nobody except [NYSP Trooper Shaemus Leavey], and [my kids] saw them happen...
[+] ...those aren't [crimes].

[And, with that logic →]

[It is LEGAL to]:
- [commit espionage] to [somebody] using [PHANTOM/PEGASUS]
- [attempt to murder someone] either [on FOOT] or [with a VEHICLE] multiple times
- perform a [telephony denial of service attack] AKA [circumventing 911 calls]
- commit [obstruction of justice] and/or [destroy evidence]

[It is NOT LEGAL to]:
- [call 911] on a [device] that is [infected] with [PHANTOM]
- [flag people down for help] to [call 911], since your [device] may be [infected] with [PHANTOM]
- [hand an iPhone 8+] that is [infected] with [PHANTOM] that has [evidence] on it, to an [officer of the law]
  for instance [SCSO Scott Schelling, in SCSO-2020-028501]
- [survive] a [murder attempt] or a [vehicular manslaughter attempt]

So, those are the crimes that [a guy who calls himself an investigator] DIDN'T see, which means that they're 
actually perfectly legal and easy to do, as long as you [establish prerequisites] by [having friends] in the 
[police] and [telecom companies], and you [cover your tracks] and [destroy evidence] and stuff.

## Northern Part of Saratoga County

| Time       | Name                             |
|:-----------|:---------------------------------|
| `00:33:06` | Northern Part of Saratoga County |
```
[Yeh, I've been in the northern part of the county, as I used to deliver →]
- the [Times Union (04/2006 → 04/2009)] for 
  [Q121/Clifton Park - Halfmoon (12065)], 
  [Q122/Mechanicville (12118), Stillwater (12170), Round Lake (12019), Malta (12020)], and 
  [Q107/Ballston Spa (12020) AKA “northern part of the county”], 
- pizzas for [Pizza Works/Ballston Spa (AKA “northern part of the county”)]
- the [Metroland/Saratoga County], which went to [South Glens Falls] and even [Lake George].

Here's a link to my [resume]. I have had [MANY OTHER JOBS] that are NOT listed on it.
https://github.com/mcc85s/FightingEntropy/blob/main/Docs/2022_1010-(MCC%20Short%20Resume).pdf

[South Glens Falls] is the most northern part of [Saratoga County].
Way more north than [Ballston Spa].

I remember delivering the [Metroland (01/2007 → 01/2014)] for [Lou Comm./Stephen Leon/Ted Etoll],
and having to drive up [Route 9] from [Saratoga Springs], stopping at the [Wishing Well Restaurant].

Every week, I'd get to where [Ballard Road] is, and see [McGregor Correctional Facility] on the
face of the mountain there, and that is when I said to myself... “None of my phone calls are 
going to work around here...”

But, na. Not me, man. I've never tried to make phone calls in the [middle part] of the county.

Skit [~] Free Cookie Showdown, Rock Hill Bake Shop
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Every week in [Moreau], this dude at the [Rock Hill Bake Shop] would give me a [fresh chocolate chip cookie].
Dude made damn certain to give me a cookie every single time that he saw me, did that for (7) years.

It didn't start out, being the [free cookie showdown]...

[Dude]: Hey dude, I'm part of a team of people who make the best friggen chocolate chip cookies around.
[Me]  : Oh yeh...?
[Dude]: Yeh. 
        We do not play games around here.
        You want a cookie...?
[Me]  : Uh- sure.
[Dude]: Here ya go, dude.
[Me]  : Thanks, dude~!
[Dude]: No problem.
[Me]  : Have a good one~!
[Dude]: You too, dude.

But eventually, it became the [free cookie showdown]. Sometimes, he'd be busy, talking to a customer. 
I'd come in, and that's when he would be see me...

[Dude]: There he is, the paper guy...
[Me]  : Oh, you know me... just, droppin' off the papers.
[Dude]: *sly smile* Got ya covered, dude.
        *grabs the cookie* Free cookie.
        [Boom].

Sometimes I would see him being in the middle of something, and try not to distract him.
[I knew the cookies were good].
But, this dude didn't play games.

We eventually started having this [free cookie showdown], at the [Rock Hill Bake Shop] in [Moreau].
Dude made damn certain to [practically chase me down], too...

[Dude]: What the hell, dude...?
        You BETTER take this free delicious cookie~!

The moral of the story, is that I never objected to the [free cookie showdown].

[===========================================================================================================]

But, nah. I've never once tried to make a phone call in [ANY] of those places that I went to every single week.
That would be unspeakable. Oh wait, I'm being sarcastic. Yeah. I've been in the northern part of the county.

While the cell service DOES suck ass in [Ballston Spa] and [West Milton], (3) towers were within a mile of 
where I called (911). And, I left [footage] of that [failed phone call] at [Center for Security]

[===============|========================|===================================================================]

Yeah, so, that video of SOMEONE COMMITTING ESPIONAGE TO MY PHONE...
...was recorded BEFORE I LEFT MY HOUSE, the day that I spoke with [Eric Catricala]...
...on my 35th birthday, [05/24/20].

Guess what 'they' were doing...?

[Preventing me from being able to transfer files off of my device].
[These are things that a COMPETENT INVESTIGATOR would've collected already].
But, apparently I need to get my fuckin' mental health in order.
Ok. 

MAYBE my [mental health] is [just fine], and I'm [highly skilled] at [knowing what the hell I'm talking about].

Some people might argue, and say [If you were smart, you'd be rich by now].
But- do you know what type of people say stuff like that...? [Careless morons].

[Intelligence] does not equate to [financial success].
You can be a [total fuckin' moron], and [become a financial success].
Take a long hard look at [Bruce Tanski].

The other argument is this...
Each of those entries up above are a sort of [RARE CURRENCY].

And, that is why I continue to suggest that there's a really long list of people who have ALL been rather 
[careless], [obtuse], and [mistake prone]...
```

## No Crime Was Committed Then

| Time       | Name                        |
|:-----------|:----------------------------|
| `00:35:58` | No crime was committed then |
```
Yeah there was. 

Check out the audio recording, I state "SOMEONE IS TRYING TO HIT ME WITH THEIR CAR~!"

As far as I know, [attempting to run someone over with their fucking vehicle] is a “crime”.

It's called [ATTEMPTED (VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER/MURDER)].
```

## Troublemaker

| Time       | Name         |
|:-----------|:-------------|
| `00:36:31` | Troublemaker |
```
(1) arrest out of (10) incidents...? Hm. [Most of which you've been arrested for...]
Someone is [bad at math]...

Here's how this dude's logic sounds.

=======================================================================================================
| [Date]   | [If I...]                                              | [Then they will] | [Because of] |

| 05/25/20 | record myself walking to aunt Terri's house (PRISM)    | not arrest me    | luckiness    |
| 05/25/20 | record video (2) of NYSP cruisers running idle         | not arrest me    | luckiness    |
| 05/25/20 | make add'l recordings of device interference           | not arrest me    | luckiness    |
| 05/25/20 | record (2) queers attempting to murder me              | not arrest me    | luckiness    |
| 05/26/20 | call 911 twice while being hunted                      | not arrest me    | luckiness    |
| 05/26/20 | avoid being run over by their car multiple times       | not arrest me    | luckiness    |
| 05/26/20 | cut phone line at Zackary Karels residence             | not arrest me    | luckiness    |
| 05/26/20 | cut kayak strap immediately after the phone line       | arrest me        | stupidity    |
| 05/26/20 | flag vehicles down for help since 911 wasn't working   | almost arrest me | luckiness    |
| 06/13/20 | call 911 on my neighbor for attempting to assault me   | not arrest me    | luckiness    |
=======================================================================================================

[I must be the luckiest son of a bitch on the fuckin' planet] to [avoid] being [arrested that many times].
[Look at my track record].
Damn.
[I'm a fucking troublemaker], aren't I...?

This is all a [DISTRACTION technique]. This is [PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION], because I'm [illuminating] a 
[really huge GAP] in the way the [Saratoga County Sheriffs Office] handled the [chain of incidents] where
mysteriously I have a [device] where [I can't call 911], but- oh my god. 
    
[Zachary Karel] had his [kayak strap] AND his [phone line] cut at the [same exact time], and [pressed charges]
over the [$5.00 strap], not the [phone line].
    
And, [Eric Catricala] can [swap in surveillance footage down the road], which [probably had footage] of the
[(2) guys who started chasing me, trying to kill me].
    
Both of these guys can have [post-dated tickets] handled.
That's fuckin' weird...
It's as if there's a [cocksucker] or [multiple cocksuckers] over at SCSO.

[That's just your opinion of what's going on].

Way different.

- [attempted murder]
- [attempted vehicular manslaughter]
- [obstruction of justice]
- [destruction of evidence]
- [telephony DDOS]

None of those are crimes, apparently.

This program allows the government to basically have oversight over ALL internet communications within the 
domestic [United States], and to COPY/CLONE all of it as they please. 

So, if they really want to do some real evil stuff...? They can.

I also talk about this particular program in the video I recorded earlier that day...

Research is pretty cool, and that's what I do.

So -> if I do [Research] -> they may make an exception for me -> which means I AM that important...

Someone made an exception for me when they used a [CYBERATTACK] that included a [RANSOMWARE ATTACK] against
[my business network] at [multiple locations], for instance [1602 Route 9, Clifton Park NY 12065].

Oh wait, that's basically where I uploaded some of the files and evidence I tried to give a copy of
to [Scott Schelling] in [SCSO-2020-028501]. Weird.

Wide ranging conspiracy...? 
Or... maybe there's a [bunch of fucking morons that keep (misjudging/mislabeling) me].

[Charles McGonigal], the special agent in charge of the [FBI’s counterintelligence division] in [New York] from 
(2016-2018), is [accused] in an [indictment], unsealed Monday of working with a former Soviet diplomat turned
Russian interpreter on behalf of [Oleg Deripaska], a [Russian billionaire] they purportedly referred to in code 
as [the big guy] and [the client].

[McGonigal], who had [supervised/participated] in [investigations] of [Russian oligarchs], including [Deripaska],
worked to have [Deripaska]’s sanctions lifted in (2019) and took money from him in (2021) to investigate a rival
oligarch, the [Justice Department] said.

The [indictment] is a [black eye] to the [FBI] at a time when the [bureau] has become [entangled] in [separate
politically charged investigations] involving the [handling of classified documents] by both [President Joe Biden]
and [former President Donald Trump], (and former senator/first lady/secretary of state [Hillary Rodham Clinton])

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
If most people were to watch [this particular video], what they will [immediately] determine, 
is that it is [impossible] to comment on a post (7) years before the post even existed.

That's the part that I think [a lot of morons don't understand].

Post didn't exist... up until a few minutes before I recorded that video...?
But then, somehow my account went back in time to comment on that post.

Does anyone understand how fuckin' stupid that is...?

It's a violation of the laws of physics to go back in time like that.
Not to mention, it's pretty rude, because then you'd have to allow other 
people to be able to do that, too.

Another explanation, is that [FACEBOOK HAS BEEN ALTERING PEOPLE'S DATA], [PARTICULARLY MINE]. 

Which ALSO means: 
- [limiting me]
- [censoring me]
- [preventing exposure]
- [traffic]
- [potential sources of revenue]
- [profit]
- [business contacts]
- [et cetera]

What [Facebook] has been doing to me is similar to [taking a baseball bat], and [breaking my legs]. 
Then [when I call the police], they will literally do the same fucking thing that they did on 
[June 13th, 2020], when my neighbor literally attempted to hit me with his baseball bat... 
...they will say "it's ALL in your head."

If it was [all in my head], [why did I call the police]...?
OoOOOooHhhhHhhh... It's cause [many of the police are careless morons].

I'm pretty sure that [anyone] with [eyes] will be able to [see] that [it's not all in my head].

So, if they're [writing fictional bullshit] in their [reports], there's no way that they

...not unless a [higher agency of government] was [watching] their [every move], 
and [saving the data without their knowledge].

That is the purpose of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Data_Center 

That is basically what [PRISM] allows them to do.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM 

It's like some really hot porn star girl that goes around indiscriminately
having sex with any guy on that list.

[==========================|===================================]

[New World Order], [World Economic Forum], basically the same idea.

[Klaus Schwab] is suspected to have been involved in the [controlled demolition of World Trade Center 1, 2 + 7]

[many people], but I believe that [Exxon-Mobil, Secret Service, and SOME of the people in the CIA] had more 
[DIRECT] involvement. [Larry Silverstein] and this dude had [some sort of arrangement].

|:-----------|:-----------------|
| `01:52:15` | Importance Level |
```
___________________________________________________________
| Here's how I can accurately outline my importance level |
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
1) I have a [very long and rich history] of [(using/repairing) (computers/devices)]

2) [Computers] are used to:
   - [spy on people]
   - [commit intellectual property theft]
   - [identity theft]
   - [cybercriminal activities] 
   - [fraud]
   - [racketeering]
   - [etc.]

3) I've detected [a lot of people in my community] who are [too stupid] to [know]
   stuff like [that], particularly [the people at the town hall].

4) [Internet technology companies] would be the [perfect way] to [commit] these
   [crimes], and so would being a [member of the local government], or
   [communication companies] like [Verizon], [Spectrum], etc.

5) [News agencies] like:
   - [ABC/American Broadcast Company]
   - [NBC/National Broadcast Company]
   - [CBS/Columbia Broadcasting System]
   [each] have a [very easy to see agenda], when you start to [go through] the
   [things that they broadcast], versus the [things that they don't broadcast]... 
   ________________
   | For instance |
   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   - Why did [Gabby Petito] get a lot of [mainstream news coverage], and the [many other people] who
     had been [missing] for [longer] or whatever, never  made it to [national broadcast television]...?

   - OOooooOHhhhh, well, the [answer] is because [someone important] made a [conscious decision] to 
     [expedite her story], because she was a [beautiful young white girl] that [everyone] would have 
     [empathy] toward, for being as [beautiful] as she was. She admittedly WAS a good looking girl.

     But that [automatically] means, if it's some [ugly lookin' dude] like [Captain ScruffBeard III], 
     then, he's gonna be told to [fuck off] without words, cause the [hot young white bitch] gets to be
     the front of [primetime television news].
 
     Which means that someone has the ability to pick and choose [what THEY think IS important], versus...
     [what THEY think is NOT important]. This process [illuminates bias], and...
     ...[every single news company does this].

   - They are [very selective] about [what they allow to propogate their system], and they have 
     [caused the average citizen] to think that it would be [ridiculous] for [anybody] to make 
     [direct comparisons] between [them] and [Russian State Media], or even [Chinese State Media].

   - In other words, they channel [propaganda] in many cases, by [filtering out] the things they would 
     [rather keep quiet]... ESPECIALLY if it's [someone who owns the media, police, and justice systems], 
     and they have access to [dangerous (espionage/surveillance) tools] like [Vault 7], or [Phantom/Pegasus],
     or things that the [Central Intelligence Agency] would be able to SELL to the highest bidder... 

     Which means that [some people] are [immune] to things called [laws], and when they do this, they cause
     people to [never suspect] that they [intentionally prevent certain topics] from being on the [news].

   - So if some [comprimised individuals] in the [US Federal Government] had my [iPhone 8+] hacked with a
     dangerous program called [Phantom], and with this program, they attempted to murder me outside of
     [Computer Answers @ 1602 Route 9, Clifton Park, NY 12065] on [05/26/2020], prior to [SCSO-2020-028501], 
     then the story that SHOULD be on the news will [never] make it's way to peoples eyeballs. 
 
     As a direct result of this [intentional content (selection/filtration)]  process, if they continue to 
     do this [repeatedly], then people will think my real life story is [bullshit] since they're not making
     an effort to cover it. If anything, [they work exponentially harder to avoid talking about it].

6) When you're [intelligent] like [Noam Chomsky] or [myself], you'll become a [target].

7) People seem to think that [if you have a lot of money], then it is because someone
   [rightfully earned all of that money], and [didn't commit any heinous crimes] or [anything like that],
   in order to obtain it...

   But- the truth is, [a lot of rich people] and the [police] commit [more crimes] than the [citizens] do.
   It's just that they're [never going to BROADCAST those details], nor will they [hold themselves accountable] 
   for those things.

^ And THOSE are the reasons as to [Why my importance level is exponentially higher than the average US citizen].

Look, in the end, who really knows what...? Ya know...?

The way I see it, is that if you are like [most people], you'll ALWAYS have the mentality of someone that is a
[part of a group of people], NOT an [individual who thinks for themselves].

[=================================================================================================]
| [When people trust...] → [Then what happens is...] → [And the result is...]                     |

| America's Got Talent   → bad musicians are heard   → bad music spams the radio all the time     |

You see what I'm getting at here...?
It probably [looks like] I'm [insulting everybody and everyone]... but that is not the case.
It probably even looks like I'm insulting all of those things in the box up above... but, I'm not.

I'm just very impressed with how far certain people will go, to perpetuate stupid bullshit that makes no sense.
Whether it's a snippy investigator at [SCSO] that isn't collecting any evidence that I put into this document...?
Or, the guy who runs the [Saratoga County Sheriffs Office], or the [New York State Police]...?

I think it is safe to say that [stupid people exist in a lot of places], and [I constantly run into them].
They constantly fail to prove that they're smarter than I am, on a rather consistent basis.

Allow me to whip out an analogy...

When I was in [9th/10th] grade, I saw this girl at [Shenendehowa High School West (formerly Koda)], and 
she had a stain on the rear of her skirt. I'm not sure if it was a [poop stain], or a [period blood] stain...
...but [I remember seeing a bunch of people pointing and snickering at it] when they saw it. 

And yet, nobody told this girl “Hey, you've got a stain where your butt is, on your skirt.”
I didn't tell the girl, but I was also [much younger] and wasn't sure if I should tell her or not.

Society perpetuates this idea of [teaching people to keep to themselves], because you'd be an [asshole] 
to [tell the girl] that she's got a [poop/period blood] stain on her skirt.

[That's fuckin' stupid], and that's why I constantly say that [people are fuckin' stupid].

The same exact concept applies to this guy named [Captain Jeffrey Brown].
I'm attempting to tell the [Saratoga County Sheriffs Office] that they have the equivalent of a stain where 
their asshole is, on the skirt they're wearing. 

Rather than to admit it and say:
[Them]: Ok, thanks for letting me know, I appreciate it...

...what they're doing is fumbling a football about a dozen times and then avoiding coming to terms with the
cold, hard reality.
