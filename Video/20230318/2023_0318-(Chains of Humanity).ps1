Audio log, Saturday March 18th, 2023
Michael Cook speaking... It's currently 07:31AM.

I'm... not entirely sure what I'm gonna talk about in this particular 
audio recording, but I am gonna talk about the concept of money, and the
idea behind fractional reserve lending, and...

The idea behind uh- like this hive mentality that people have regarding
money, specifically...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:00:32","00:00:58",@'
And, how uh- all of these things combined, they sort of like uh- 
they commandeer people's uh- sensibilities, right...?

So I have spoken about this concept numerous times before, and uh-
It really is a daunting task, because I'm not entirely certain
how to shape this narrative, further...
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:00:58","00:01:34",@'
...without uh- causing people to, uh- I don't know, feel repulsed, 
by either what I'm saying, or the reality, or both.

So, take this into consideration, right...?

In the movie [The Matrix], starring [Keanu Reeves], [Lawrence Fishburne],
and uh- I can't remember the girl's name, uh- [Trinity].

I think it's like [Carrie Ann Moss], or somethin'...?
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:01:34","00:02:02",@'
Well, anyway uh- in the movie, [The Matrix], uh- [Morpheus] asks [Neo],
uh whether he would like to take the [red pill] or the [blue pill].

Right...? And uh- 
I forget exactly which one is which, but uh-
'@)

$Ctrl.X(0,"00:02:02","00:02:24",@'
I- I think the red pill is the one where he goes back in to Never Never land,
and then the blue pill, if he takes that one, then he wakes up. And he sees
how far down the rabbit hole goes and everything...

It's been a while since I've seen the actual movie, but- the notion that I'm
alluding to, is uh-
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:02:24","00:03:01",@'
It really is a 100% identical uh- it's an illustration for how uh- the concept
of money controls people.

It controls their actions...?
It controls their decision making process...?
It controls what they do...?

Right...? Like, I'm not impervious to this, either, like... 
I- I just think that I have a much higher resistance than most people, because
I have asked myself a number of questions as to why people make the decisions
that they do... in reference to uh- money, specifically. Right...?
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:03:01","00:03:31",@'
So... When I was 10 years old, my father was murdered, he was a cab driver 
in Albany, working for a company name OK Cab, or OK Ta- excuse me, OK Taxi.

And, uh- the office was located on uh- Second Ave.
I guess it used to be over on Essex Street.

But um...
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:03:31","00:03:58",@'
I remember my father used to bring me along with him sometimes, when he
would do his job. Right...? And uh- me and my father weren't gettin' 
along in the months leading up to his death...

I'm not gonna elaborate on that specifically in this recording, but what
I will say is this, right...? um...
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:03:58","00:04:38",@'
My father may not have been killed over the money he had in his possession...
Right...? And uh- it took me a really long time to even ask this question, 
like, is that the [main motivation] behind what happened...?

Because I know that most people in society, they're gonna say that money
is the most motivating factor for anybody.

However, um...
There are higher motivations than that.

And, uh- money is basically just a token that allows people to transfer,
um... ya know, their tokens of appreciation, or, or whatever...?
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:04:38","00:05:06",@'
Um- there are a lot of things that are enveloped within the concept of
the monetary system. So for instance, like uh- guilt and shame...?

Embarassment...?
Uhm, pride...?
Uh- worthiness...?
Uh... intelligence...?

All these things are enveloped within the monetary system, believe it
or not. Right...?
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:05:06","00:05:30",@'
And uh- ya know, um... if people think about what's right and wrong...
They have to figure out like, uh- at what point does something that
IS right become wrong... And the same question can be applied in the
reverse direction- at what point is something wr- can soomething wrong-
be considered right...?
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:05:30","00:05:51",@'
And so the concept of [philosophy], defines [when] and [where] those- those
uh things are located.

But- typically in our society, uh- people will uh- go along with other
people's personalities, or- they'll trust somebody's personality, over
like- the [facts]. Or even in some cases, the [evidence].
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:05:51","00:06:25",@'
Right...? And so, back on uh [September 12th, 2022]... uh- former uh 
[Secretary of State], [Hillary Rodham Clinton], I believe she was the
[Secretary of State]... uh, she was also like a [Senator] for [New York],
and the former [First Lady]...

She had an interview with this lady on [CNN], right...?
And uh- this lady on [CNN]'s like:
[Lady]: Ya know, I know you've been like uh- prejudged and everything...
        Right...?

And it's like...
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:06:25","00:06:53",@'
Yeh, like, the- the people in the news...?
They like to dance around the uh- the usage of the word [prejudge], or
[prejudice]...?

But their entire, like livelihoods solely depend on people having this,
in certain amounts.

So [prejudice] can be broken down into multi- multiple different aspects,
but most people associate prejudice with like uh- a negative connotation.
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:06:53","00:07:16",@'
However, [prejudice] can also be applied in the positive connotation, and
uh- being able to describe what terms define what's in the negative zone
and the positive zone, um, it requires a bit of explanation that you don't
get when you like, watch the news...

Or, you're watching anything on broadcast television...
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:07:16","00:07:48",@'
Right...? More often than not, you'll learn more from watching things on
YouTube, or doing your own research and going to like Wikipedia...

Right...? And uh- I'll even throw in uh- snopes.com
Like, because, they do a pretty decent job of trying to get it right.

It's not a consistent case where they're right, but- ya know, it's 
consistent enough, to where their reputation is still gonna get a thumbs
up by, universally uh- practically uh, universal acclaim.
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:07:48","00:08:12",@'
Right, and so, this concept of money uh- it disillusions people to the 
degree where... it causes people to disable their uh- their uh natural 
tendency to be like:
[People]: Oh, well what about ME...?
...when somebody gets something that THEY didn't get.
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:08:12","00:08:42",@'
Well, somebody else gets something that they didn't get, right...?
So like uh- let me put this into a context, right...?

Um- I went to school with a guy named [Chad Gregory].
[Chad Gregory] is the owner of [Next Generation Roofing].

[Chad Gregory] and I were in the same grade, we rode the same bus,
and uh- we went to the same school, right...?

I remember him from childhood, right...?
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:08:42","00:09:07",@'
Uh- at no point whatsoever did I think to myself, because I'm
not like most people, like when he started to succeed with his
company, "Well what about ME, or MY business or whatever...?"

Right, but most people DO think that.
Like "Well, what about ME...? Why didn't I succeed or whatever...?"

It really comes down to the fact that like, [Chad] was a pretty
likeable guy, to basically like everybody.
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:09:07","00:09:42",@'
Right...? Uh- I haven't seen him nor talked to him for a while.
But- um, the concept that I'm alluding to, there, is like, [envy]
and [jealousy].

Right, they're both- they're (2) sides to the same coin.
Right...?

Am I jealous or envious of [Chad]'s success...?
Well, I'm not envious or jealous of it, like- I think that he did
well for himself, and a lot of people seem to like his work.

But at the same time, I understand like, he's worked with shady
characters.
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:09:42","00:10:14",@'
I'm not gonna talk about that right now.
What I am gonna say is this...

Right...?
The death of my father, caused me to repulse the idea of money
being the thing that motivates me to do what I do, or think the
way that I think, but most people in our society...?

They revolve- the entire thing that they think about, or what
motivates them...? Is dollar signs. Dollar signs. Is what causes-
Is what motivates most people.
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:10:14","00:10:50",@'
Right...?
But- ya know, after like uh- suffering the loss of my father and
everything, I really spent a number of years just kind of like, 
distancing myself from the way that everybody else thinks.

And like, I've made so many observations that most people would never
pick up on, because- like, they're controlled by this concept of like,
money and like, being more important than one another.

And like, uh- ya know, uh- having things to show for their success and
everything, right...?
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:10:50","00:11:21",@'
So like, case in point. Um, there's this video of like a couple of kids,
well, they're not kids, they're like adults. And they got like uh- I 
dunno, they have like uh- like, jewelry on their teeth or whatever...

And it's... really stupid looking...?
Right...? But- they're rich.
They are stupid rich.

I don't know how much money they have, but- ya know, a lot of people in
society...? They envy them.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:11:21","00:11:40",@'
Right...? They think that like, what they do is COOL...?
And then like, that's why they're rich and everything...?
And like they can literally just uh- ya know, take piles of cash, throw
it in a dumpster, and light it on fire...?

And they'll still have plenty more, to waste.
Right...?
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:11:40","00:12:00",@'
But like, uh- most people in society, if they see somebody like,
taking a shitload of cash, and throwing it in a dumpster and lighting
it on fire...? Most people will freak the fuck out.

They'll be like:
[People]: What are you doing burning all that cash...?!?
          Oh my god~!

Right...? But-
'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:12:00","00:12:27",@'
Ya know, take a step back from what causes that cash to be made, and
then you realize that like, heh.

A lot of things are wasted and destroyed, in order to create all of those
dollars. But I mean, like, further to that point, like, a lot of what 
backs- uh, our money system, is [bullshit].

Which is why I spoke about [fractional reserve lending].
Right...? [Fractional reserve lending] is an idea that like, our monetary
system is [overprovisioned].'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:12:27","00:12:51",@'
Ya know, back in the old days, uh- people would, uh- uh- my friend Eric
told me about all this, but like- the way he that he defined it was
something that I was already talking to him about, but he wasn't like, 
paying attention to the words that I was saying, so like-

He- he kept telling me that I was like an idiot, to describe it the way
that I was describing it, or that like, I didn't describe it the way
that he understood it.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:12:51","00:13:17",@'
But basically, it's like this.
If there is, like, somebody that owns a gar- a [bar of gold]...?
And they wanna like, use it to like, trade for goods or services or 
whatever...?

They'll take the bar of gold, and they'll bring it to the blacksmith,
right...? And then, the blacksmith will just hang onto it, because,
like, the person doesn't wanna carry the gold around because of how
heavy it is.

And, because of how valuable it is.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:13:17","00:13:36",@'
Right...? The [blacksmith] is [tough]...
He can make [weapons] out of [metal]...?
And he can basically tell people to [eat a dick], if need be...?

And that's the idea of uh- like keeping uh- [security].
Ya know...? [Security] involves like [weapons], and [tough guys].'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:13:36","00:14:05",@'
Not necessarily [smart guys]...?
But [tough guys] and [weapons].
Ya know...?

Mind meaning though we're in the modern age now, where security has taken
on a totally different context, um...

But uh-
Anyway, uh- suppose that somebody uh- that uh- wants to trade some of the
gold that they gave to the blacksmith, uh- for like, I dunno, like a horse
and carriage or somethin'.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:14:05","00:14:40",@'
Um- now, compound that by like uh- hundreds or thousands of people in a
village, they all have like, a piece of that- gar- bar of gold...?

That they own...? So that they can trade it around and stuff...?
And like, what you'll find out, is basically, um...

The gold- the blacksmith got to a point where like:
[Blacksmith]: Alright, how about I just issue a note, for that piece of gold...
              Because, if- not all of these people are gonna come back, and
              take the gold out at the same time, or whatever...?
              In order to trade it around...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:14:40","00:14:54",@'
Cause basically what would happen is like, somebody would take the gold,
and then they'd tran- they'd- they'd give it to the other person, and then
the other person would give the- the goods or service or whatever, back...?

And then they would take- the person would take the gold, and bring it back
to the [blacksmith].'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:14:54","00:15:06",@'
So like, the person that originally had the gold, would keep it with the
[blacksmith], they'd take it out, from the [blacksmith], and then they would
go trade the gold for the thing, and then the other person would come back
with that same bar of gold, and then holy shit, there it is.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:15:06","00:15:29",@'
So, the blacksmith caught onto this, and started overprovisioning- excuse
me, overprovisioning the uh- amount of gold, that could be provisioned.

It's basically [bullshit].

That's what I mean, is the- that's what [overprovisioning] and 
[fractional reserve lending] is, is- it's [bullshit].

The stuff that backs money...?
Is just, like, [inflated like a balloon].'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:15:29","00:15:50",@'
Ya know, you take the original balloon, right...?
And then you blow, like, [hot air] into it, which is basically the
same thing as [bullshit], [hot air] and [bullshit]...

And then you blow it into the balloon, and then the balloon it- it
takes up a lot more volume... because it [expanded].

It [expanded].'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:15:50","00:16:39",@'
And like, uh- once you like try to take the balloon back...?

Like, [somebody owns that entire balloon], but- it's been provisioned
to a whole bunch of other people by the [blacksmith], uh- then you
pop it, and then all that hot air goes to waste.

So like, that's the idea of what our economy is backed by.
A lot of fuckin' hot air.

Right...? So...
Thinking about how uh- this applies to... like uh- my father being killed
when I was 10 years old...?

Uhm, I think that there were other motivating factors for my father being
killed, and... that those motivating factors had very little to do with
money.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:16:39","00:17:07",@'
It had more to do with the fear of death, by somebody else.
Or, I dunno. I could be wrong about some of these uh- uh- suspicions of
mine, I could be wrong...

And that is something that the police often, uh- fail to say out loud.
Right...? They hate to say this out loud, like:
[Police]: I could be wrong about this...

Because then people would be like:
[People]: Well then you ARE wrong...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:17:07","00:17:51",@'
Right...? And uh- 
It comes down to like when people know their rights...?

Uh- it's not unlike the hot air balloon...?
Or the balloon with the hot air in it...?

Right, the police will come around...?
They'll assume that somebody doesn't know their rights...?
And so like, their power is basically an inflated balloon...?

Right? And then you say like uh-
[You]: Nah, look I know what my rights are, and basically like
       you're not obeying protocol...?
    
Right, and the police- sometimes the police will say uh:
[Cop]: You're correct about like uh- what you know...
       Et cetera and so forth...
       But, I'm still gonna, ya know, just uh- just
       push ya outta the way here...?
       Just cause I have to...
       You know...?
       Standard operating procedure, is to just ignore
       your rights, and then just do whatever...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:17:51","00:18:08",@'
Right...?
That's what happened, like, with me and this guy from SCSO, 
K. Rossi... back on, [February 26th, 2023] at the [Market 32]
in [Clifton Park], right...?

I told him...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:18:08","00:18:56",@'
Uh- that uh- ya know, I'm not gonna cover the whole concept at
length here, but uh- what I am gonna say is this... right...?

Being intelligent does not equate to becoming rich or successful.
In some cases, being intelligent causes people that had mommy and
daddy, hand down their riches to their, ignorant children, to
give them more control. So if you like, embarrass them or humiliate
them, they will use mommy and daddy's money vault of doom...
...to be able to uh- force their will upon other people.
And that is what the police tend to- tend to take orders from.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:18:56","00:19:19",@'
So like, if you ARE intelligent enough to like, tell the police officers
that aren't doing their jobs correctly, that:
[You]: You're doin' your jobs incorrectly...

...what they'll do is: 
[Cop]: I can't be wrong, cause you know...
       somebody's thrown me a stack of cash, 
       or thrown me an order... 
       and I can't disobey that order...
       even if it is wrong, or illegal for me to do this...
       so, I have to do this.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:19:19","00:19:46",@'
And then so like, that is what causes so many problems in our society.
Right...? I'm not gonna go around and try to like, uh- blast individual
uh- police officers over and over again, unless...

Like, they [repeat this behavior].
By making some of these audio recordings, I can uh- detail an account
for things that have happened to me in my life, because I know that like
no matter how many recordings I make of the police, and- uh- sounding...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:19:46","00:20:05",@'
They don't understand, how to do their job as well as I do in many cases, 
right...? What- the problem is that like, most other people, they'll think
that I'm either bullshitting them, or they'll say:

[People]: Yeah but you're not a police officer, so you can't possibly be
          correct about any of that...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:20:05","00:20:23",@'
Some people WILL have this mentality. Right...?
It's because, like, this uh- idea of uh- money, it causes people to drop
their guard, and think that like, you need to have more money in order
to be more important.

Uh- sure. Ok.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:20:23","00:20:50",@'
But you know, further to that point, like, our government like, encourages this mentality, 
and uh- many of the people in the press or the news agencies...?

And many corporations...? They encourage this behavior too.

Which is problematic because then it causes this uh- this uhm, conflict of interest.
Right...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:20:50","00:21:08",@'
So, the interest is, that everybody wants to keep this hot air inside the balloon.

No- they don't- they wanna prevent anybody from poppin' that baloon open, not unlike
how like when a cell divides, like uh- when cells are reproducing they divide right
down the middle and stuff, right...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:21:08","00:21:34",@'
Well, uh- that's what this whole system is attempting to do, is to prevent the cell from dividing.
Or, from collapsing, I should say... right?

So, um, the entire world would devolve into chaos if the monetary system did fail,
however, there doesn't seem to be enough effort on uh- like uh- going around
and popping people's balloons... '@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:21:34","00:21:53",@'
Right...? Or like what'll happen is like, people will get like uh- they'll try to get like, their house
or their property evaluated...?

Right...? And then when they do, they'll find out that like, hey, the house...?

Nah, I was just thinkin' about this earlier, actually, like...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:21:53","00:22:14",@'
And people will uh- go and buy like a (400,000) dollar house or somethin', right...?
And they'll be like:
[Somebody]: Wow, wow, look at my (400,000) dollar house.
            Wow, it's such a cool house.
            Wow.

And then they'll tell all their friends, and they'll have like a house warming party, 
or like a christening party, or whatever...? Right...?

And then like...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:22:14","00:22:53",@'
Now they're all there, they're in the brand new (400,000) dollar house, right...?
And then all of a sudden...?
[Bruce Tanski] builds a (600,000) dollar house across the street, and then the
neighbors are like:

[Neighbors] Hey, hey, look at our brand new (600,000) dollar house~!

And then like, the people that bought the (400,000) dollar house, they're like:

[400K]: Yeah, you're- you- you might have a c- a house that's worth like 
        (600,000) dollars, but- ya know, it looks stupid compared to my
        (400,000) dollar house...

And then the people with the (600,000) dollar house will be like:
[600K]: Yeh, uhm, nah nah, it's just your opinion that the s- our house,
        looks, stupid, compared to yours. Ya know, your house, it- it looks
        cheaper.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:22:53","00:23:12",@'
And then they'll be like:
[400K]: Well it's just your opinion that my house looks cheaper than your...
        uh- lame-looking house.

Right...? And then so like, people will keep these things inside, right...?
Not realizing that like there's very little, visual difference between the 
(400,000) dollar house, and the (600,000) dollar house.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:23:12","00:23:34",@'
Yeah, one of em might have like an indoor pool or something, and like, I dunno.
Like, I dunno.

It is...
It might have like a couple extra bedrooms, and it might have like a third bay
in the garage or something lame like that. And they'll be like that's the 
(600,000) dollar house and the (400,000) dollar house. Right...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:23:34","00:24:19",@'
So like- what I can say for certain, is that like most houses...?
Uh- the raw materials to build, like a (400,000) or (600,000) dollar house...?

It's like, (20,000) dollars.
For the raw materials.
If not, less.

A lot of it goes into the labor, but it- also, a lot of it is uh- like uh- the
inspections, and like making sure the engineering and blueprints are on par, or
snuff or whatever...?

And that like, people aren't makin' mistakes...?
And that like, they have to go back and like level things...?
And make sure everything's like, measured correctly...?
And that it fits according to plan, and it fits like, somebody's like- uh...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:24:19","00:24:37",@'
I dunno. It- it fits every... box or requirement that is expected of it...?
And then uh- once all of that is said and done...?

Right...? Then they can start bragging about how much their house costs,
or what they could sell it for.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:24:37","00:25:20",@'
Ya know, houses typically uh- when they're resold, they maintain their value,
where like if you buy a car, most cars lose value, unless of course you buy
like a really well built car...

Or, a car that like, has been bought from a reputable company like-

Ya know, if you buy like a Chevy Malibu, 2023- I dunno if they make the
Malibu anymore, but- you buy a Chevy Malibu 2023, right...?

As soon as- for like, I dunno, (30) grand...?
As soon as you drive it off of the lot...?
It loses like (5) grand in value...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:25:20","00:26:17",@'
So even if you drive it right off the lot, and you drive it right back...?
You're only gonna get like (25,000) dollars back outta that (30) grand.

Right...?
But- lets say you buy a Lamborghini.

As soon as you drive that Lamborghini off of the lot...?
Uh- it still has, it's pretty close to the same value.

Why is that the case...?
Well it's because, a lot of cars are made to break down, they're
engineered to break down, so if you spend more money on a vehicle,
they will engineer it better.

But if you spend less money on a vehicle...?
They will give you a box of bolts and shit.
Loosely connected...?
And every single bump and, and crack in the road is gonna cause those
bolts and lags to start to like, ya know, like uh- loosen up.

Oh boy.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:26:17","00:26:53",@'
Yeah, so like, these are the things that uh- go into like keeping value.
It- it, and uh- ya know, like uh- this coffee shop that I was going to
for a while, they have like a bunch of paintings there, right...?

And uh- the paintings all have like an estimated value.
You wanna buy this painting...?
Here's the author of the painting...?
Here's how much the painting costs...?
And uh- ya know...?

The paintings aren't bad.
But- those paintings are prolly gonna stick there- stay there for a while.

Mainly because, like, it's not the proper setting to sell art.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:26:53","00:27:10",@'
Though, I might be like uh- I might not be correct about that, maybe 
some time- at- at some point in time, someone will come along, and they'll
be like:
[Someone]: I'd like to buy this painting right here...

And then the coffee shop will be like:
[Shop]: Really...?

And they'll be like:
[Someone]: Yeh yeh yeh, I wanna buy the painting, I wanna buy the painting.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:27:10","00:27:41",@'
And then uh- they buy the painting, and then they like- they brag about it.
They're like:
[Someone]: Look at this, awesome painting that I got at the coffee shop.
           You know, it's amazing...

And then, people'll be like:
[People]: Wow.
          That's a pretty cool painting.
[Someone]: It is, it is a pretty cool painting.

Because somebody put a lot of time and effort into making that painting.
And, what I can say, further to that point, is that somebody put more
time and effort into that painting, than some of these cars that like
GM makes.

Right...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:27:41","00:28:15",@'
And uh- heh. Like they got to a point where like they just slowly, make
the cars, like have these design flaws that cost a lot of money or time
to fix...? Or both...?

And then uh- same thing goes with the houses.
Though, I think the houses tend to last a lot longer, uh- in general.

It's not a consistent case.
Modular homes and even like, mobile homes, those tend to degrade pretty
quickly even if they are brand new... right, and uh-'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:28:15","00:28:57",@'
That's mainly becuase uh- ya know, the foundation does tend to matter.
But also, the materials.
Uhm, the idea behind like, uh- like- a layer of roofing is that it'll 
last a generation, right...?

So I think- I don't think, [Chad] was taking a page from [Star Trek]
when he decided to name his company [Next Generation Roofing].

Nah, I think what he was doing was trying to make it- make his- the
name of his company be the sales point.

[Chad]: You know what...?
        When you get a roofing job from US...?
        It's gonna last until the next generation.
        That's why it's [Next Generation Roofing].'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:28:57","00:29:24",@'
Right...? And uh- it's such a simple idea, to like, make a sales
point about the name of the business.

That uh- it- it- really, it's like uh- a no- practically a no brainer.
But- ya know, I wanna take away from uh- like uh- a lot of the points
that I- I wanna walk back, from many of the points I made, and talk
specifically about how uh- it- it- regardless of the facts...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:29:24","00:29:43",@'
Like, everybody in society...?
They do this uh- this thing where, every decision that they make, is 
meant to like, put more money in their pocket somehow, rather than to 
like, uh- increase the value of the things that they're doing.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:29:43","00:30:05",@'
Right...?
A lot of people- uh- they struggle to identify with, what is it that
gives- excuse me, they struggle to identify with uh- like, the reason
why the paintings, why they get the value that they do, or why, a
house gets the value that it does. Or why, uh- a vehicle will get the
value that it does. Right...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:30:05","00:30:34",@'
Uhm, each of these things that I've rattled off, their value is determined
through some means. Right...? Wi- with a house...? Uh, you'll get someone
who comes, and they give the house an appraisal. And it costs money to
have them do this, they need to spend a fair amount of time being able to
do it... and uh- typically, if you invite a house appraisal- uh- appraiser
to a house that's like, not picture perfect or whatever...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:30:34","00:31:09",@'
They won't even like, continue to appraise the house or nothin'.
Nah, they'll just see it, and they'll be like: 
[Appraiser]: This house is shit.
             I'm outta here.

So if it's not picture perfect, they will literally...
they won't say those words, but their actions will say it.

They'll be like: 
[Appraiser]: Oh, uh- ya know, I think that uh- I uh-I think that...

I dunno, I really, I'm not gonna try to like, come up with 
something on their behalf or whatever, but- uhm...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:31:09","00:31:34",@'
People in society, they do this, where uh- they judge each other based
on possessions, rather than like uh- like how intelligent they are, or
what they have to offer...?

People judge each other based on their possessions.
It's- it's plain and simple, that is what a lot of people in our society
do. So like if uh- if somebody owns property...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:31:34","00:32:26",@'
And they have a house or a bunch of stuff ont he property, and it's all
shit, but they still own the property...? Ya know, and the person could
be really, like, not very intelligent at all...? But like, then somebody
who's like, really smart...? Like uh- had their father murdered when 
they were a kid, who like continues to make a bunch of content, where he
sounds very sophisticated and he's trying to educate other people...

Well, for whatever reason, our society will still give preference to the
idiot who owns a whole bunch of property, over the person that sounds
sophisticated and is attempting to teach people everything, about like 
how flawed our society is...

And the reason that they do it, is because...
...this is what the schools teach people to do.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:32:26","00:32:59",@'
Right...?
So when people pay their taxes, they're paying the schools to educate
their children to judge each other based on their possessions. Ya know,
if somebody doesn't possess anything...?

Then that means that they're a loser.

That is what the schools teach the children.
In our country.
And in other countries.

It's what our society teaches people.
If somebody doesn't have possessions...?
Then they're a scumbag.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:32:59","00:33:40",@'
Right...?

But- at some point in the future, the concept behind money, is gonna
be replaced by, a concept that they had back in 1776. 

Like, bartering... 
Bartering and sharing stuff. 

Ya know, uh- gluttony is a [very serious problem].
[Gluttony] and uh- riches.

I don't wanna say that like, everybody that is a rich person,
or wealthy, that uh- they have a negative connotation of 
[gluttony] going on...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:33:40","00:34:14",@'
However, it is one of the seven deadly sins.
I'm not gonna really talk about the seven deadly sins so much, 
because, uhm- really what they all devolve into, is like these
ideas of like envy, jealousy, uhm, deception- uh, like murder,
and things like that.

[Basic human instincts].
Where like, [you don't wanna be killed]...? 
Then, so like, [don't kill anybody else].

The golden rule, treat other people as you would like to be treated.

However, uh- some people see that as a one-way street.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:34:14","00:35:04",@'
Right...? As soon as they have like a title...?
They forget about like, the idea behind like, uh- treating people as
equals and treating them with respect... no matter whether they have
possessions or not...?

Or, no matter whether they're an idiot or not...
Right...?

So, um, often times what'll happen is uh- people will just go along
with the whole show, because like, some people have something to show
for like, what they've worked for...?

And like, they didn't need to be like super duper intelligent to earn
like all the things that they earned in their life...? But- ya know,
what they earned took a certain amount of time for them to earn those
things, right...?

And uh...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:35:04","00:35:28",@'
There are so many scams and systems in play, that cause people to not
even realize that they've been fooled, in virtually every instance
where uh- ya know someone's signing their life away.

Typically this has a lot to do with uh- like, I dunno, mortgages.
Or uh- car payments.
Or car loans.
Or student loans.
Right...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:35:28","00:36:01",@'
So, um, president Joe Biden thinks that it would be a good idea to 
[eliminate student debt]. And [I agree].

But- do you know who doesn't think it's a good idea to 
[eliminate student debt]...?

Uh- the banks that like, issued the debt.
To all the people that took out student loans and stuff.

The reason being, is it gives them ability to uh- earn uh- interest
on the [principle balance].'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:36:01","00:36:33",@'
Right...? So like, they have all these systems set up to where like uh-
most- a lot of people that go to school...?

They wind up uh- getting a job.
But that's not a consistent case, many times, people will go to school
and they won't get a job that like furthers their, uh- I dunno, uh-
furthers their, career or whatever.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:36:33","00:37:30",@'
Right...? And uh- ya know, there's something at play here, where a lot
of people are getting bamboozled, and it allows like, certain people to
become very successful, and a lot of other people to be shafted...?

And uh- what you're left with is that like, our entire like, system has
a number of illusions at play, where... like- some people that are rich
or powerful or wealthy, they want like, obedient servants to be, uh paid
for their hard work.

They don't wanna pay people that are like willing to compete, with uh
their business model, or thier source of revenue, or their source of power...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:37:30","00:38:05",@'
Like if I go around and I expose a whole bunch of things like, uh [Joe Manchin].
Li- or uh- P- [Paul] or [Joe], I can't remember his first name, it's either
[Paul] or [Joe].

Uh- he's like:
[Manchin]: I don't want the [student loan] thing, at all...
           the [student loan forgiveness package of doom].
           Nah, I'm gonna work really hard to prevent that from making it in.
           And it doesn't matter what the number is...?
           I'm just gonna continue to go in front of the cameras, and say
           that like, uh- the number wasn't agreeable.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:38:05","00:38:31",@'
Mainly because, um, there are a number of lobbyists or whatever they call
the people that like pay the people in the government that run for office...?

Like, to shut the hell up, and vote for their agenda...?
Right...?
So a lot of the people in the government, they're like a [puppet].
They're there, because like some rich people put them into that office,
because they're gonna wind up doing their bidding.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:38:31","00:39:12",@'
Right...? So, this isn't a consistent case, but it's consistent enough
to where you can see- like there- w- whether you know who's involved in
what...? You can sort of like, uh- aggregate like, ok...

If uh, there's an investor out there, or some rich billionaire that
doesn't like the idea of student loan forgiveness...? And uh- Joe Manchin
doesn't like the idea of student loan forgiveness...?

That like, uh- maybe uh- it's worth researching whether or not that rich
person like, had anything to do with [Joe Manchin] getting into office, 
and uh whether they have any [communications] with one another.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:39:12","00:40:05",@'
So these are the sort of things you might be able to see or aggregate
at a comp- or a place like the [National Security Agency], or like
[Verizon], or like any sort of [telecommunications company].

Right...?
So like, if uh- it comes down to like, [Joe Manchin] and some rich
billionaire keeping a secret or whatever, then they have to make sure
that a whole bunch of people, in the [law enforcement system] and the
[justice system], like they're all paid their salaries, right...?

In order to like,uh- perpetuate this idea of uh- like, ya know everything
that I've described so far, ya know, should very clearly, like describe
or like outline, like uh- how devious some people are in our uh- country
and economy, right...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:40:05","00:40:47",@'
So... Now, I gotta uh- like uh- unwind this like a- a fair amount, because
I don't think that everybody with a lot of money does this...

They might do certain things to a certain extent, but I really don't think
that they all like, violate people's rights, or they like, manipulate the 
system or uh- the politics, politi- politics all that much...

Right...?
They might like, make an appearance every once in a while, they might
say somethin', like [Larry Elliston]. I think that's his name...

The guy uh- the CEO of [Oracle], [Larry Ellison].'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:40:47","00:41:13",@'
Like, uh- he's not the type of dude that I think, he's goin' around,
doin' the shit that I just described.

Ya know, he- he- uh- he did well for himself with [Oracle], and [Oracle]
does a lot of cool stuff. And uh- they basically did a lot- they have a
lot of overlapping, uh- roles with uh- [Microsoft]...

Right...? And uh-'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:41:13","00:41:33",@'
Ya know, [Oracle] is nothing to joke about.
They're uh- they're a big company, and I find it really hard to believe, 
that uh- a guy like [Larry Ellison], would go around, like paying people
to like uh- say no to the [student loan forgiveness] thing.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:41:33","00:42:01",@'
However, uhm, there are a lot of people that could never, ever, ever, come
close to like the success of [Microsoft] or [Oracle], that like, they have like
thousands of friends that are friends with governors all around the country
in each state... And like, they're sort of people that would like, be cool
with uh- the idea of uh- all (50) states making parts for the [F-35]...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:42:01","00:42:42",@'
Right...? Sort of like, uh- somebody suckin' on somebody's teat.
That's- That's- that's the idea behind money, is that somebody has to suck on
SOMEBODY's fuckin' teat somewhere... Right...?

And, uh- I'm not against the idea of money, what I'm against is like, how the
idea of money causes certain people to think of like, stupid fuckin' shit to
stay rich, or to get rich, and screw over as many people as they can, as long
as they do it without them knowing that they're screwing them over, or if they
DO know it, like uh- they have to like, they have to sign the dotted line, and
like uh- hit the checkbox or whatever.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:42:42","00:43:20",@'
Ya know, it's like:
[Somebody]: Initial here.
            Initial there...
            Initial there...
            And then read all the fine-
            Do- Ah, you don't wanna read all the fine print.
            Don't rea- eh.
            I mean, if you wanna read the fine print...?
            Go ahead, read the fine print.
            But I mean, like, you want that fuckin' nice car right there,
            or you want that nice house...?
            Right...?
            Yeh yeh yeh, alright.
            Well, read the- 
            Eh.
            You don't need to read the fine print then, ya know...?
            You're gettin' what you want~!

Right...?
And as soon as that person gets what they want...

They don't realize that like, they're taking on the responsibility of like, 
turning- like- their forseeable future...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:43:20","00:43:56",@'
...is paying off the car payments or the house payments or mortgage...

And then like, all of the unexpected things that happen in the future...?
Will likely cause them to like, uhm, derail.

There's a lot of things in life that happen that are unexpected, right...?
So, this happens to [most people] and it's why a lot of things are risky.

There's no way to really guarantee anything, that involves some level of 
risk... Right...?

This is something that [Edward Snowden] talks about, with [John Oliver].

[Snowden]: The only time that you're like, eliminating risk, is when
           you're in prison.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:43:56","00:44:39",@'
But even that, that's not even true, because you could be shanked, by
somebody in the prison.

But- um, ya know, the- the idea that I'm alluding to, is specifically,
uhm, I wanna sk- walk back to the conv- the point that I just made, again, 
but I lost it.

Uh- how like uh- so, people will insure, like uh- the student loan company,
and it wi- it will basically- they- the companies and the people that place
their bets, they place bets, right...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:44:39","00:45:04",@'
So like, they know that the odds are, that most people that get a student
loan, they're not gonna- like, be able to do a whole lot with it or whatever,
and like uh- they're gonna take on this added debt responsibility, but 
they're not gonna get like, much in the way of like uh- compensation for
all of their hard work or their trip to school or whatever, right...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:45:04","00:45:35",@'
And so like, the companies that issue these loans, they'll have predatory
lending practices even, ya know, this is something that [ITT Tech] like uh-
experienced, uhm...

And uh- what happens is uh- the people that like invest in the student loans,
they make a lot of money off of like, people not finishing to pay their
student loan debts. Basically it's like a residual, it's like residual income.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:45:35","00:46:09",@'
When they don't pay their- their loan payments.
Right...? So like, what happens is this.

Uh- they're able to uh- place bets, on whether some individual will finish
shcool and finish paying off their loans, or... whether they won't.

And uh- the way they have it set up, is that it- it's not unlike car payments
and their cars being- people's cars being repossessed, and the banks having to 
like, recoup their money somehow...? And like, the insurance comapnies also 
getting involved in this...? Right...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:46:09","00:46:49",@'
All of these industries, have like a [circle of fifths] going on, where like, 
even if the person cannot pay for the, the thing...? Or they don't have
collateral for it...?

They've posted up, like everything they need to come clean on their end.
And to get their- their money back, or their interest.

And that is the reason why, if Joe Biden, like, cancels- like, goes around
and forgives student loans and stuff...? 

A lot of people that were getting residual checks, for people not finishing
the payment of their loans and stuff...? They're not gonna get that 
interest anymore if the loans are forgiven.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:46:49","00:47:24",@'
No... so like, it basically, it violates their entire corrupt system.
And, believe it or not, but there are like a ton of industries that do this
shit.

Though like, I don't know the particulars, I just know that like, it's
happening to a lot of people. Where, people can easily get a loan- a student
loan to go to school and stuff, right...?

But if they want a business loan, for their business...?
Then, they're basically told to fuck off, because...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:47:24","00:47:47",@'
You gotta have like uh-
You gotta have (100) rings...?
From like, [Sonic the Hedgehog 2]...?
You gotta have the [(7) Chaos Emeralds]...?
You gotta like, jump, after you collect at least (50) rings...?
And then you gotta turn into [Super Sonic], and you got the
blonde hair, you're not the blue hedgehog anymore...
You're the fuckin', you're the- uh, [Super Saiyan] lookin' hedgehog...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:47:47","00:48:12",@'
Your hair's all blonde, or whitish...?
You look like a meaner version of yourself...?
And uh- you're not even, your feet aren't even touchin' the ground 
anymore, you're just gliding above the ground, and you're flyin' 
around like [Superman], basically.

And uh- then like at that point...?
Then uh- you have to go through the whole game...?
And beat Dr. Robotnik about (8)- (12) times...?

(12) times...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:48:12","00:49:23",@'
Uh- you have to beat, [Dr. Robotnik]'s stupid fuckin', uh-
boss...? Uh- the first level boss...? And then like, the-
then you get to fight [Dr. Robotnik] himself, in one of his
stupid fuckin' machines and stuff... 

And then, uh- then you go onto the next stage, then you do this
for like, ya know, (12) stages, and then on like the last few
stages...? You have like uh- like a THIRD stage... So like, 
the second stage becomes like another stupid robot...? Maybe
the same stupid robot that you beat in the first stage, again...?

And then, uh- the third...? Uh- the third one, then you finally
fight [Dr. Robotnik], and he'll be like:
[Dr. Robotnik]: Ha ha ha, you're fucked now, [Sonic]...

But, you're [Super Sonic], so like, you can literally just fuckin'
jump around like a fuckin' nutcase...? And nobody can really do
anything about it...? Not even him...?

And then like, you destroy like, after you hit him (8) times...?
You destroy his stupid fuckin' lame ass robot, again...?

And, then his robot falls apart, and then, like, he might like, run
off like an idiot, or he might like uh- get into uh- his uh- doom ship.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:49:23","00:50:09",@'
And then you gotta fly through the sky...? With Tails...?
And then you gotta like, uhm, you gotta like fl- jump from platform to
platform...

I'm basically describing [Sonic the Hedgehog 2], but like, ya know...

Then, uhm, then you have to meet up with [Mario], and then uh- then uh-
you gotta tell [Mario]...

Hey [Mario], you need to collect all 125 stars...?
Then you gotta kick the shit out of [Bowser]...?

And then Mario does that...
And then, when Mario does that...?

Then [Super Mar-], [Super Sonic], and [Mario], they- they do the fist
bump of doom, and then it causes like an explosion, and then uh- an
explosion of coolness, and then what happens is uh- then you get like, uh'@)

What the hell's his name...? (Crash Bandicoot)
The Echidna...
I can't even remember his name.
From [Sony Playstation]. 

I can't remember the fuckin' name of the stupid thing...
He's not stupid, uh-

Anyway, uhm, the idea that I'm alluding to here, is this...
Is like, they really set up a lot of complicated things, that most
people are gonna fail to be able to do, because they didn't read
the fine print.

And reading the fine print is really important, because, ya know...?

If the fine print includes the description of everything that I just
fuckin' said...? You might be better off just playin' the fuckin'
game [Sonic the Hedgehog 2]...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:50:55","00:51:11",@'
And then like, beating [Dr. Robotnik], and collecting all the fuckin'
Chaos Emeralds, and then, eh- ya know, I'm making it- sound very long
winded and like complicated for a reason, right...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:51:11","00:51:44",@'
It's basically like uh- the- the level of uh- treachery that some wealthy
people have established with the banking system, and the blacksmith of
doom on the other side of the planet that has an unlimited amount of 
gold that it can provision to people.

So basically, what causes some people to become more rich, is uh- other
people's misfortunes.

And, those misfortunes are basically like, ya know, preventing certain
people from like, having a- a- a modicum of success.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:51:44","00:52:25",@'
Right...? And uh- everybody has a different definition of what success
means. Does success mean that you're gonna have [billions of dollars]
like [Bill Gates], or [Elon Musk]...?

Well, a lot of people seem to think that.
But- ya know, that doesn't necessarily mean that, uh-

That doesn't necessarily mean that you cant find success in other ways,
so like, if you get to a point in your life where you've made all of 
the observations that I have, you can avoid going through the fuckin'
uh- number of uh- pitfalls that I found myself being uh- consumed by, 
as well as like many other people my generation...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:52:25","00:52:50",@'
Right...? And then you can start to focus on like what things people
will need in the future, when the entire system that we have now...?
It collapses.

Because like, there's a level of unsustainability with uh- our society
right now, there's a lot of things that are thrown away every day, 
there's a lot of people that like uh- they build the house and then
the house gets like, uh- repossessed...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:52:50","00:53:08",@'
And then, in many cases like a house that like they- someone, like- if
someone gets a mortgage on a house, and they pay half of the mortgage, 
they don't get half of that money back, they don't get that money back
if they can't continue to pay it off...? No, they lose it all.

They forfeit it all.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:53:08","00:53:57",@'
Oh boy. They forfeit it all. Smae thing occurs with the cars. Right...?

And so, the idea behind like, collateral, is pretty important, because
like, you need to have enough collateral, in order to like, convince
somebody to like, place a bet, and see the odds as like, in their favor.

Because if the odds are in their favor, and then they win out big time,
you can bet your ass that they're gonna go ahead and bet, very easily.

But if the odds are AGAINST them...?
You can bet your ass that they'll spend money, to like, find some way to
fuck you over.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:53:57","00:54:25",@'
Ohhhhhh... so that's what our society is like, uh- heh. That's what it
devolves to, is... finding ways to screw people over without having to
openly admit that that's what they're doing.

It's what a lot of people do...?
But- ya know, like- screwing other people over, ya know, to what level,
do they do this...?

Do they send a team of hitmen with rifles and knives to like, come gut
you like a fish...? Well, in some cases that'll be the military that
does that.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:54:25","00:55:05",@'
But- ya know, they're not gonna send the military after a fuckin' citizen
that's not payin' his student loans, no. If anything, what they'll do is, 
they'll try to send like a bunch of police officers to like, smear somebody's
record a thousand times, instead of like uh- doing their job correctly.

And what they'll do, is they'll drag their feet, and, it'd basically be like
uh- ya know, uh- like a full-grown man, going to the island with a bunch of
kids in uh what was it, uh- what was the name of that book...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:55:05","00:55:33",@'
Uh, [Lord of the Flies]...?
Right...? You go to the island [Lord of the Flies], and you're a full grown
adult, and all these kids on the island are tryin' to tell you what to do,
or whatever, and you're like:
[You]: Nah, dude...
       Uhm, ya- just shut the hell up...?
       Heh. You do what I tell ya to.

And it's like, they're like:
[Kids]: Nope, that's not how we do things on the island [Lord of the Flies].
        You're in trouble now...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:55:33","00:55:52",@'
That's basically a metaphor for like, how our government gets down.
Right...?

It's not a consistent case where like, everybody uh- they have smart people
in the government, and they have honest people in the government, too.

They also have some incredibly uh- douchebaggish people in the government.
They also have some very dangerous people in the government.
Right...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:55:52","00:56:24",@'
And, they don't wanna openly admit these things...?
Uh, the poeople in the government, they know that they have like, some 
fuckin' shady trollmeisters amongst them, and they also know that they
have more integrity than like, a lot of people in society...? So like...

They have to like, get along with each other like, I dunno.
I really don't know how to describe it, but- you know, like uh-

Our entire society is full of people that uh- they- they mix and match
like uh- what their values are.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:56:24","00:56:42",@'
So, what I can say is this, what gives the paintings their value, is
not just the amount of time that uh- a person put into painting the 
painting, but also like, how much time they put into developing the
skills to be able to envision the idea within the painting.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:56:42","00:57:02",@'
Right, and so like, uh- I was looking at this one painting, and it had
a reflection, and in a- it was basically a picture, of a pond within the
woods, and on the surface of the water you could see a reflection of 
like uh- uh- a- the sky, or the trees and stuff...? And I thought that
was pretty cool.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:57:02","00:57:33",@'
Right...? But- um, when it comes to an appraisal of a car, it really just
comes down to like, reading up a god damn blue book, and just determining
whether the car is screwed up... Right...?

Uhm, and then also, uh- when it comes to appraising a house, the quickest
way that they can appraise a house, is bylike, taking a look at it, and
seeing if its like perfect from the outside.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:57:33","00:57:49",@'
If it's not perfect from the outside, they're gonna tell ya "Bye."
If it is perfect from the outside, then they'll take a look inside, and
then they'll look to see if the aesthetics match up, and the measurements
are level, and this that and the other thing...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:57:49","00:58:17",@'
And they'll get very, uh- into the nitty gritty of like, how uh- everything
appears, [appearances]. How things [appear].

And that's what they will work with.
How things [appear].

Because, underneath everything that appears before their very eyes, they'll
be able to determine whether or not things are structurally sound.

In many cases there could be problems hiding in plain sight, but- as long
as everything looks perfect, then it doesn't matter.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:58:17","00:59:19",@'
And, then they can, like evaluate this (400,000) dollar house, to be worth 
(400,000) dollars. Right...? And uh- ya know, owning a house costs money,
so it's not just paying for the house itself, but like it also uh- can- it 
also uh- requires like maintaining the house, and keeping it in order, and
uh- there's a lot of money that goes into being a homeowner.

But- ya know, once somebody is stuck within a home, and then you like try 
to uh- do the same thing that [Morpheus] does to [Neo] in [The Matrix], ya
know some people will realize "Holy fucking shit."

...when they're knee deep in the middle of a car payment, or a student loan,
or a mortgage, or a having some level of repair or whatever done...?

And like, they just write it off, they're just like:
"Well, whatever dude. There's nothing I can do about it, I'm stuck."'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:59:19","00:59:52",@'
Right, and someone else basically owns that person.
They don't see it that way, because they see themselves as the owner of the
house, or the car, or uh- the student loan...? 
Or the education or whatever...?

But- someone else owns that person, and until they pay off the house,
they're stuck right in the middle of a fuckin', like, they're basically
turning their life into uh- someone elses' wealth.

And the amount of time they spend doing whatever the hell they do, and
our society is full of this, ya know...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"00:59:52","01:00:37",@'
It's like, unless you get to- you could make it (29) years and (6) months 
into a mortgage payment, but like if you break both your legs in the last
(6) months, and you've got no way to pay the- the remaining balance of the 
mortgage or whatever, and you can't get it like, uhm, you can't get the 
balance like uh- refinanced or whatever...?

They will come and repossess the house, and the (29) and a half years that
someone spent, dutifully paying their mortgage...?

They lose out like over like, less than like (2) percent, of like, eh-
maybe like less than a fraction of a percent, of uh- the remaining balance 
that they had left to pay.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:00:37","01:01:24",@'
Which is a tragedy, because heh. 
Ya know, it's all or nothing.

It's basically a game, and uh- there are so many uh layers of deception 
involved in uh- ya know, whether it's owning a car, or whether it's owning
a house, or whether it's owning- really, even property.

Eh, because owning property, you have to pay the taxes on the property.
You have to pay the taxes to the schools...?
And the schools teach the kids how to like, ya know, uh- basically
everything I've explained in this whole audio log.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:01:24","01:02:04",@'
That is what they teach the kids at the school.

Ya know, they do teach them a lotof helpful things in life, I'm not
discounting that. But they also like teach them things to where they
have to make certain assumptions as to what they're being educated about.

So like, if somebody's who's good looking, and uh- ya know, liked by
a lot of other kids in their class...? 

They're gonna be, like, uh- they're gonna be, respected by the other kids.
And the other kids are gonna be like:

[Kids]: Hey, uh- you know, uh- we think you're cool...? 
        And we want you to be the leader of the debate club and everything...?

And then the leader of the debate club goes around, tellin' everybody:
[Leader]: Hey, I'm gonna be like uh- uh- the mayor of the town.
          I'm gonna clean this town up.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:02:04","01:02:43",@'
And then what they do, is they wind up, doin' uhm, they wind up like uh-
backpedaling on thier campaign promises, because someone came along and
they were like:

[Someone]: Hey.
           How would you like to, ya know, be freed of the chains of
           humanity...?

And they'll be like:
[Leader] : Well, what the hell do you mean freed of the [chains of humanity]...?
[Someone]: Freed of the [chains of humanity] means that like, I'm gonna throw
           you such a large stack of cash, that you'll never ever ever have to
           worry about paying a mortgage, or a car loan, or uh- a student loan...
           ...ever again.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:02:43","01:03:10",@'
And then they'll be like:
[Leader] : Well... uhm, hell yeah< I would like that a lot~!

And then they'll be like:
[Someone]: Alright, so, go ahead and sign your soul away, right now.

And then, that's what they do.
They sign their fucking soul away.

And then, they basically become a puppet, of somebody with a lot
of cash that told em what to do, and how to do it, how high to jump,
and then they become that person's property.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:03:10","01:03:45",@'
Believe it or not.
The coolest kid in class, becomes another person's property, and then
like the coolest kid in class, like he drives around in this really
cool car all the time...?

He's got a (400,000) dollar house, or a (600,000) dollar house, and like
uh- ya know, like, he has to keep up appearances, and like if he ever
comes across somebody as intelligent as like [Michael Cook], he's 
gonna run his fuckin' mouth and say:
[Leader]: That dude's a fuckin' douchebag.
          Ya know...?
          He always has been...?
          Always will be...?
          His father was a douchebag too...?
          Fuck that guy, that dude's a fuckin' douchebag.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:03:45","01:04:03",@'
Right, and the reason that they do it is because, like, they
have [no control over it]. They really don't.

Ya know...? They'll say "No, I definitely have control over it..."
But- ya know, like, [actions speak louder than words].

Ya know...?
And that is how our entire society works.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:04:03","01:04:38",@'
Ya know, I'm goin' all the way back down to like, the primal roots of
how humans evolve and everything, right...?

At the end of the day, this entire system is gonna collapse, mainly
because, like at some point, uh, the power- uh- grid, as well as the
telecommunications grid, at some point in the future, these things
are gonna be free again.

They're go- there's no way around it.
It WILL be free, power will be free, you'll be able to heat your home
and power your home, with [solar energy].'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:04:38","01:05:02",@'
And then they'll have to like send people to go around and sabotage
people's solar panels, be like:
[People]: How dare you use renewable energy, you stupid son of a bitch...
          Nah, now your solar panels aren't workin'...
          How do you like that...?

Ya know, someone's gonna catch on really fuckin' quickly, and be like,
why the hell isn't my power lasting an entire day...? Or an entire week,
or an entire month...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:05:02","01:06:07",@'
Ya know...? Not unlike when there's a hole in somebody's gas tank...?
They're not gonna get very far, when their car, uh- tank- their gas tank
has a hole in it, no way dude.

You're not- you're gonna be like, you're gonna be like
"Well, what the fuck...? I smell gas..."

Ya know, then you're gonna keep drivin, and then like, and you'll be like:
"Well dude, I fuckin' smell gas, and I didn't even like, open the gas can."

1:05:31
And then like, they're gonna get like, half the distance they normally
would, and be like "What the fuck is goin' on, dude...? I'm only gettin'
like (150) miles a tank...? This is bullshit..."

And basically, they won't know whether or not like, GM just sold them
another shit car...? That just suddenly stopped getting the mileage that
it was supposed to get...? Or, what was advertised...?

Or, some shady trollmeister somewhere, like, they turned a knob in the
engine compartment, so that the engine runs a little more rich, and then
it burns through the gasoline a lot faster.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:06:07","01:07:01",@'
And this might be something that a warranty uh- uh- someone like
[Northstar Chevrolet] would do, when you pay for a warranty.
The full bumper-to-bumper warranty 5000, and then you go to bring the car
in to get service, and then they say:
"Oh yeh, the car had all these problems, right...?"

And then they fixed all those problems, but-
The problem that you brought it there for, it still has that problem.

This is what [Northstar Chevrolet] did to me when I had my
[2004 Pontiac Grand Prix], ya know...?

Paid through the nose for that fuckin' vehicle, and I was upside down
in the car loan, when uh- the fuckin' engine, uh- died on me. I- I had
a year and a half worth of payments left, and my engine, it just died.

And then, uh- that was at like, (105,000) miles.
Or maybe it was the transmission that died first...
I can't remember.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:07:01","01:07:37",@'
But I know that the engine and transmission died in that vehicle, and
I had to get them both replaced, separately. Ya know the car made it
about (280,000) miles, would've been able to drive the car to the moon,
with that fuckin' thing.

But, you know uh- General Motors designs their vehicles to break down,
and uh- ya know, there are so mny things in our society that are designed
to break down and produce waste, because... waste puts money into certain
people's pockets, and it takes opportunities away from other people.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:07:37","01:08:35",@'
And then they're told that like uh- ya- ya know, I'm not gonna get into
the nitty gritty of like uh- how uh- how deep the layers of deception
truly are...?

But what I can say is this, they do say that hindsight is 20/20.
Right...? Hindsight is 20/20.

So like, what- what they're basically saying, is like, you have to like,
be quick-witted enough to know what the hell's goin' on right in front of
you...?

And in order to do that, you have to know things ahead of time.
So, in order to know things ahead of time, you have to know what
someone else has done beforehand, and uh- their experience and their
education, and their life...? Right...? And, uh- 

They will work really hard to disillusion everybody from payin' attention
to somebody that's been around the fuckin' block...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:08:35","01:09:20",@'
And has had all these fuckin' stupid scams happen to them...
Right...?

So, here's an analogy, uhm...
I've been puttin' like slices of pizza in a bag, right...?
And uh- this uh- my backpack has like I'll- I have- I'll occasionally
put like a can of uh- like uh cologne or whatever the hell it's called,
like body spray...

And uh, sometimes what'll happen is the top of it will like, break off,
and then it will like, spray out all over the inside of my backpack,
which- ya know, makes me smell- makes my backpack smell like uh- cologne
or body spray for a while, right...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:09:20","01:10:01",@'
But- ya know, like, uh- the slices of pizza, when I go to heat them up,
they'll taste like the fuckin' the cologne, or the body spray. And I'm
sittin' there thinkin' "What the fuck...? Ya know...? How the hell did
it get through the bag...?"

Ya know, here's the best case that I can make.

When uh- dogs or canines that work for the police, they- they smell drugs
and stuff...? It works the same way as like, detecting bullshit that people
say. Right...? Uhm, like the smell permeates other substances, and it
carries forward like osmosis through a membrane.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:10:01","01:10:33",@'
So osmosis is sort of like how water will pass through a membrane, right...?
And uh- the way that it does it is because the molecules are able to pass
through, like, the thing in the middle. Typically it'll be like glass or 
it'll be like uh- what the hell, uhm, [plastic]...?

Glass or plastic...?
Right...?

It can also go through like uh- varying other membranes and stuff too, right?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:10:33","01:11:09",@'
But- ya know uh- the thick and thin of it is this...
Well, some people ar epretty stupid, and uh- they think that other people
are idiots. And like, when someone isn't an idiot, they'll actually single
that person out, if they're not playing along with the, the game that
everybody else is playing.

Right...? And then, like, everybody will work against this one person, 
that isn't like tied to the chains of humanity at all.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:11:09","01:11:39",@'
You know, the chains of humanity, is probably gonna be the name of this
audio log. [Chains of Humanity]... I like that idea.

The [Chains of Humanity], um- 
Is basically like this...
Possess-

Jesus Christ like, often prophesized about this, like uh-
possessions are chains. Ya know, having some possessions isn't like, bad
or evil or whatever...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:11:39","01:12:18",@'
But- I think, that a lot of people put a lot of emphasis on like, having stuff...
and like, if you don't have stuff...?
Then you're a loser.

And you wanna know why people do that...?
It's because people are stuck inside of like, a (30) year mortgage, where...
they have to make it an entire (30) years so they can own their house for like
(10) years while they're retired.

Yeh. So like, that's how it is, it's like...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:12:18","01:12:41",@'
Somebody who's a first time house buyer...? 
They buy the house...?
They spend the (30) years paying off the mortgage, and owning the house and everything...?
And then like, Oh, at some point, Oh.
They- they can't work anymore, so they gotta retire...?
So, did they save up for retirement too...?
Oh, they saved up for retirement too, oh, good. Ok. Good. So like...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:12:41","01:13:06",@'
Their retirement accounted for them to be able to uh-
Ya know, uh- be able to- ya know, buy breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next 
fuckin' (15) years...? And uh- you know uh-, maybe the maximum like, amount of 
like, leisure they have when they're that old...?

...is uh- going to the library.
Yeh.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:13:06","01:15:19",@'
So they go to the library and they study up on all the things that like,
[Michael Cook] was attempting to teach them, like (30) years before they retired...

And then they found out:
[Them]: Holy shit.
        That dude [Michael Cook] was onto something, why the hell didn't I 
        listen to him...?

Nah, here- here's the reality.
Some people um, they're gonna head ahead of all these things, and the way they're
gonna do it is by listening to guys like [Jeremy Rifken] FIRST, ya know...?

People aren't gonna wanna listen to a lot of the things I say FIRST, I understand
that. But, ya know, in order for me to be taken seriously from now until the 
future...?

Um, people have to understand that at some point, our system is gonna collapse.

It's not unlike how uh- uh, Rome collapsed, or uh Greece collapsed. 
The Roman Empire...? The Byzantine Empire...?
They collapsed...?

1:14:02
Why did these great empires collapse...?
Well, it's because like, humanity has a very [serious flaw].

And the flaw is, appearances- it's- eh, humanity operates on this notion,
[seeing is believing], and then like, but- they don't tell each other, often
enough, [but appearances can be deceiving].

So what I mean specifically, is like this...
You know, behind door number (1)...
Behind every door, there's gonna be a [hot girl], where you can have sex with her,
and have a bunch of kids.

But- they all have a [varying alternate attribute]. Right...?

Behind door number (1)...? Is the hot-dumb bitch.
The hot-dumb bitch...? She likes to lie a lot.
Every time that she opens her mouth, you never really know whether you can trust
what the hell she's saying...? But, she is fuckin' hot, dude.

Then uh- you don't know if you're gonna wind up getting divorced...?
Or, if your mortgage is gonna fall apart halfway through...?
Or if she's gonna like, try to stab you to death...?
Ya know, these are things that you're not gonna fuckin' know about...
...um, other than the fact that she is fuckin' dumb.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:15:19","01:15:57",@'
Right...? And then behind door number (2)...?
There is a smart girl. Smart girl...? 
Likes to be honest...?
Likes to tell the truth...?
She's very loyal, very obedient, and uh- she's got a lot goin' on for her
other than her looks, and uh- she isn't- thing is, is like, she's not
gonna tolerate being lied to.

You need to consistently tell her the truth at all times...?
And uh, in exchange for that, she is gonna be yours.

And you can have a LOT of kids with this girl, too...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:15:57","01:16:36",@'
Right...?
So, door number (1)...? 
Door number (2)...?
And, door number (3)...?
You've got the mixed bag.

You've got the hot-crazy wife matrix of doom, shit...
It's basically, a random, a randomly fuckin' generated value...
Nobody knows what the hell is behind door number (3)... 

You just know that it could be some hot, really dumb bitch...?
Or it could be some hot really smart bitch...
It could be, uhm, hot-dumb-loyal...?
Or, hot-smart-loyal...?

Or, hot-dumb and NOT loyal...
Or, hot-smart and NOT loyal...

Because all these properties matter.
Right...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:16:36","01:17:12",@'
And, in order to understand like the true value of all these things, of all
these particular girls...? You have to have a [courting session] with them, 
so if like, most people in society, they just like, fuckin' uh- hook up with
the first girl that they see all the time...?

They're not gonna be able to understand whether that like, decision that they
make in one day...? Is gonna alter their future in (15-30) years.

Ya know, like um- '@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:17:12","01:17:38",@'
The idea behind marriage, is like:
"Oh, as soon as you get married to somebody, you're like TIED to somebody."

And uh- another thing behind marriage is like, how much money goes into like,
a relationship or whatever. Right...?

So, all these things that I've said, they don't account for the regrets
people have later in life.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:17:38","01:18:33",@'
Right, some people, they're gonna be like, uh- reluctant to- to say, whether
they regret something or not...? Because like, they might make it like (20) 
years through their mortgage and pay off their house and everything, but- 

You know what...?
They're like, upset with themselves, because they realized that if they made
a couple of other choices that weren't so risky, they could've uh- had a plan
for success that didn't involve screwing over other people or lying to them, 
but it involved just manufacturing something that was uh- gonna produce a lot
less waste, that was gonna be renewable...?

And it offered some smart ways to improve their quality of life...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:18:33","01:19:09",@'
So these things are very important, because, like...

We have this technology now, it's the first time in human civilization, where
we can really fine tune the amount of things that are being wasted, and- 
that's what the future holds.

The future holds, the idea that uh- humans have to be more resourceful, less
wasteful, and uh- to uh- to start to filter out the properties that they believe
and don't believe. And what- from what I can tell, like there's a lot of people
in the government that like, continue to be lobbied by some rich bastard who's

And like, they act like [Joe Manchin], and [Joe Manchin], or [Paul Manchin], 
he's gonna continue to say:

[Manchin]: I don't like the student loan forgiveness package of doom...
           Nah, I don't like the way it looks.

Nah, there's a reason why he's sayin' he doesn't like the way it looks.
It's because a lot of people all around the country, that have been giving,
that have been sucking off of like, somebody's fuckin' teat...?

Ohhhh, they don't like the idea of the teat being taken away forcibly, and
so what they're gonna do, is they're gonna use every fuckin' tool at their
disposal, to continue being like the slave masters back in the 1800's.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:19:45","01:20:08",@'
Yeah.
That is, effectively what uh- our society does right now.
Right...? A lot of people in our society, they don't realize that like, 
they operate exactly, in a nearly identical way to how the slaves used to
operate, except, the way that it's different now, is like, instead of slaves
workin' for free, they're getting like, paid, and they get housing and 
everything... well, um...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:20:08","01:21:31",@'
Now, like everybody is like forced to like, live around the poverty line or 
below or above, or whatever. They do a really good job of makin' it seem like
they give a shit about the every-day ordinary citizen...?

But- I'm pretty sure that they don't, because, you know, situations like Richard
Sackler... Richard Sackler can like, uh- make this drug that is very addictive,
and it got a lot of people addicted, it got a whole industry like, screwed up...

And uh...

1:20:47
Ya know, the legacy of Richard Sackler is not a good one...
But there are a lot of people that will basically chortle on his nutsack, and
like, do whatever the hell he tells them to. There's a lot of people in the
government that do that shit.

For Richard Sackler.
They'll jump in front of a bullet for Richard Sackler.
Or, maybe they won't.

Ya know, they'll be like:
[Them]: Well, I wouldn't jump in front of a bullet for Richard Sackler, but...
        Ya know, if he's gonna throw me a stack of (50,000) dollars...?
        I'll fuckin' take it...
        And then uh- I'll just tell like, everybody that tries to attack Richard
        Sackler to fuck off... And then, I'll shoot them...
        

$Ctrl.X(0,"01:21:31","01:22:14",@'
Yeh, so like, what I'm- so- alluding to, is like, Richard Sackler has his own
security team. Ah- uh, more than likely. Ya know, he's got enough money to
fuckin' pay for... enough weapons, and uh- ammunition, to like, keep himself
like protected...?

Ya know, he's not gonna be- people aren't gonna think well of Richard Sackler
for the forseeable future, but ya know, his life, uh- it's protected.

Right...?
A lot of people work to protect him, and uh- ya know, a lot of people in
the government, have worked to uh- effectively what I'm alluding to is this,
like money causes people to act pretty fuckin' stupid sometimes.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:22:14","01:22:45",@'
Ya know, I don't wanna say it's a consistent case where like, money causes
thi- think or do stupid shit... But, it's often enough to where like, sometimes
you can ask somebody, "Would you suck some dude's dick for a million dollars...?"

And then like, ya know somebody might say:
[Somebody]: Yeah, I'll do that.

And it's like:
[You]     : Well, what if I record it on video...?

Then they'll change their answer, and be like:
[Somebody]: No no no, no no no, not if you're recordin' it on video...
            ...then I wouldn't.
            Nah nah nah, I wouldn't suck-
            Wouldn't suck some guys dick for a million dollars if uh-
            you were recording a video of it...
[You]     : Well, why not...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:22:45","01:23:21",@'
[Somebody]: Uh, cause I wouldn't want other people to see that video.
[You]     : But you said that you would do it for a million dollars...?
[Somebody]: Not if other people could see it, though.
[You]     : Well, why not...?
[Somebody]: Well, because other people would be able to see me suckin'
            some dude's dick for a million dollars. And then-
[You]     : Oh, well, but I mean... 
            Why would that change your mind...?
[Somebody]: Because other people would see it.
[You]     : Oh, well, just because other people could see it, doesn't,
            ya know, well, how, why does that change your mind...?
[Somebody]: Because other people would see it, and they would realize
            that I sucked some dude's dick for a million dollars.
[You]     : Oh, so if other people SEE it, then you wouldn't do it...
[Somebody]: Right.
[You]     : Alright.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:23:21","01:24:04",@'
So, the concept there, is that as long as people can do things where they're
not being seen...? Uh, then they'll continue to do those things, because
they're not being seen.

And, the problem with humanity, is this... right...?

There exists, a dimension above us, where all of the decisions that we have
ever made, for our entire life have already been seen and witnessed, and
categorized, and uh- ya know, some people are really stupid...?

And they think that is babbledy-gook, and those are the types of people
that like to suck somebody's dude's- somebody's dick, for a million dollars,
as long as they're not recorded or seen doing it.'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:24:04","01:24:58",@'
Yeah, so the concept that I'm alluding to is like, we live in a certain 
dimension, and uh- I'm gonna touch on this Carl Sagan metaphor here, right...?

So Carl Sagan, he's like:
[Sagan]: You get a bunch of 2D flatlanders, right...?
         And then you get a sphere, and then you take the sphere, which
         is a (3) dimensional object, and then you have to cut it into slices
         so that the 2D flatlanders can understand the 3D sphere.
         Right...? And as the fuckin' 3D sphere passes through the- 
         the flatlander's world...?
         Then uh- the- the flatlanders are all like:
         "Holy shit~! What the hell is that thing...?"
         And then they're like:
         "Holy shit, that thing is fuckin' weird..."

And then like, you know, uh- the same concept applies to how uh- a lot of people
in our society...? '@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:24:58","01:25:45",@'
They think that as long as nobody sees what they do- the decisions that they make,
that there's no way that anyone could- would ever know. And that's why, like that's
what's so dangerous about humanity, is that there are- some people who think that...?

They're fuckin' stupid.
Ya know...?
It's not like every single decision that somebody makes, is gonna cause, is gonna
cause someone like me to think that they're fuckin' stupid for makin' that decision
knowing that no one could SEE what they were doing and that no one would ever know...

Right...?
But- certain decisions that these people make, cause other people to have to keep
skeletons in their closet, and basically like uh suck on somebody's dick, for a
million dollars, and that's-'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:25:45","01:26:02",@'
They're gonna continue to do it, because people aren't able to see them doing it, 
they're doing it within the shadows.

And as long as nobody knows that they're doin' it in the shadows...?
They're just gonna keep doin' it...?
And no one is ever gonna stop them.

Unless...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:26:02","01:26:36",@'
People wise up.
And they listen to some of the things I'm attempting to educate other people.
There are ways to see things, that other people, like, will say:

[Someone]: There's no way that they would know, that I made some decision,
           as long as they didn't see it...
           
Well, you really don't need to like, be able to see anything, other than like uh- 
know that the same- the metaphor that I r- that I rose earlier, the analogy that
I rose earlier, about like the smell...?
Of uh- the body spray, on my slice of pizza, from within the bag...?'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:26:36","01:27:26",@'
It's the same concept to like:
[Somebody]: No one will ever know that I sucked some dude's
            dick for a million dollars...

Yeah.
Someone WILL know, it's just that like, your idea of knowing something...?
Is like, basically seeing it.
And that would be knowing something.

But- that's just an opinion.
That is just a fuckin' opinion, dude.

1:27:05
Some people, they do this, where they're gonna fuckin' suck some dude's dick
for a million dollars, as long as nobody sees it.

But if you ask them the same question:

[You]     : What if I record it on video...?
[Somebody]: No no no, no no, I would NOT suck some dude's dick for a million
            dollars if people saw it.
[You]     : Oh...'@)


$Ctrl.X(0,"01:27:26","01:27:45",@'
Well, that's a problem because basically, shedding some light on the subject
causes somebody to change their decision making process.

Huh...
That's a fuckin' problem.

1:27:38
End log.

00:00
Audio log, Saturday March 18th, 2023
Michael Cook speaking... It's currently 07:31AM.

I'm... not entirely sure what I'm gonna talk about in this particular 
audio recording, but I am gonna talk about the concept of money, and the
idea behind fractional reserve lending, and...

The idea behind uh- like this hive mentality that people have regarding
money, specifically...

00:32
And, how uh- all of these things combined, they sort of like uh- 
they commandeer people's uh- sensibilities, right...?

So I have spoken about this concept numerous times before, and uh-
It really is a daunting task, because I'm not entirely certain
how to shape this narrative, further...

00:58
...without uh- causing people to, uh- I don't know, feel repulsed, 
by either what I'm saying, or the reality, or both.

So, take this into consideration, right...?

In the movie [The Matrix], starring [Keanu Reeves], [Lawrence Fishburne],
and uh- I can't remember the girl's name, uh- [Trinity].

I think it's like [Carrie Ann Moss], or somethin'...?

01:34
Well, anyway uh- in the movie, [The Matrix], uh- [Morpheus] asks [Neo],
uh whether he would like to take the [red pill] or the [blue pill].

Right...? And uh- 
I forget exactly which one is which, but uh- 

02:02
I- I think the red pill is the one where he goes back in to Never Never land,
and then the blue pill, if he takes that one, then he wakes up. And he sees
how far down the rabbit hole goes and everything...

It's been a while since I've seen the actual movie, but- the notion that I'm
alluding to, is uh-

02:24
It really is a 100% identical uh- it's an illustration for how uh- the concept
of money controls people.

It controls their actions...?
It controls their decision making process...?
It controls what they do...?

Right...? Like, I'm not impervious to this, either, like... 
I- I just think that I have a much higher resistance than most people, because
I have asked myself a number of questions as to why people make the decisions
that they do... in reference to uh- money, specifically. Right...?

03:01
So... When I was 10 years old, my father was murdered, he was a cab driver 
in Albany, working for a company name OK Cab, or OK Ta- excuse me, OK Taxi.

And, uh- the office was located on uh- Second Ave.
I guess it used to be over on Essex Street.

But um...

03:31
I remember my father used to bring me along with him sometimes, when he
would do his job. Right...? And uh- me and my father weren't gettin' 
along in the months leading up to his death...

I'm not gonna elaborate on that specifically in this recording, but what
I will say is this, right...? um...

03:58
My father may not have been killed over the money he had in his possession...
Right...? And uh- it took me a really long time to even ask this question, 
like, is that the [main motivation] behind what happened...?

Because I know that most people in society, they're gonna say that money
is the most motivating factor for anybody.

However, um...
There are higher motivations than that.

And, uh- money is basically just a token that allows people to transfer,
um... ya know, their tokens of appreciation, or, or whatever...?

04:38
Um- there are a lot of things that are enveloped within the concept of
the monetary system. So for instance, like uh- guilt and shame...?

Embarassment...?
Uhm, pride...?
Uh- worthiness...?
Uh... intelligence...?

All these things are enveloped within the monetary system, believe it
or not. Right...?

05:06
And uh- ya know, um... if people think about what's right and wrong...
They have to figure out like, uh- at what point does something that
IS right become wrong... And the same question can be applied in the
reverse direction- at what point is something wr- can soomething wrong-
be considered right...?

05:30
And so the concept of [philosophy], defines [when] and [where] those- those
uh things are located.

But- typically in our society, uh- people will uh- go along with other
people's personalities, or- they'll trust somebody's personality, over
like- the [facts]. Or even in some cases, the [evidence].

05:51
Right...? And so, back on uh [September 12th, 2022]... uh- former uh 
[Secretary of State], [Hillary Rodham Clinton], I believe she was the
[Secretary of State]... uh, she was also like a [Senator] for [New York],
and the former [First Lady]...

She had an interview with this lady on [CNN], right...?
And uh- this lady on [CNN]'s like:
[Lady]: Ya know, I know you've been like uh- prejudged and everything...
        Right...?

And it's like...

06:25
Yeh, like, the- the people in the news...?
They like to dance around the uh- the usage of the word [prejudge], or
[prejudice]...?

But their entire, like livelihoods solely depend on people having this,
in certain amounts.

So [prejudice] can be broken down into multi- multiple different aspects,
but most people associate prejudice with like uh- a negative connotation.

06:53
However, [prejudice] can also be applied in the positive connotation, and
uh- being able to describe what terms define what's in the negative zone
and the positive zone, um, it requires a bit of explanation that you don't
get when you like, watch the news...

Or, you're watching anything on broadcast television...

07:16
Right...? More often than not, you'll learn more from watching things on
YouTube, or doing your own research and going to like Wikipedia...

Right...? And uh- I'll even throw in uh- snopes.com
Like, because, they do a pretty decent job of trying to get it right.

It's not a consistent case where they're right, but- ya know, it's 
consistent enough, to where their reputation is still gonna get a thumbs
up by, universally uh- practically uh, universal acclaim.

07:48
Right, and so, this concept of money uh- it disillusions people to the 
degree where... it causes people to disable their uh- their uh natural 
tendency to be like:
[People]: Oh, well what about ME...?
...when somebody gets something that THEY didn't get.

08:12
Well, somebody else gets something that they didn't get, right...?
So like uh- let me put this into a context, right...?

Um- I went to school with a guy named [Chad Gregory].
[Chad Gregory] is the owner of [Next Generation Roofing].

[Chad Gregory] and I were in the same grade, we rode the same bus,
and uh- we went to the same school, right...?

I remember him from childhood, right...?

08:42
Uh- at no point whatsoever did I think to myself, because I'm
not like most people, like when he started to succeed with his
company, "Well what about ME, or MY business or whatever...?"

Right, but most people DO think that.
Like "Well, what about ME...? Why didn't I succeed or whatever...?"

It really comes down to the fact that like, [Chad] was a pretty
likeable guy, to basically like everybody.

09:07
Right...? Uh- I haven't seen him nor talked to him for a while.
But- um, the concept that I'm alluding to, there, is like, [envy]
and [jealousy].

Right, they're both- they're (2) sides to the same coin.
Right...?

Am I jealous or envious of [Chad]'s success...?
Well, I'm not envious or jealous of it, like- I think that he did
well for himself, and a lot of people seem to like his work.

But at the same time, I understand like, he's worked with shady
characters.

09:42
I'm not gonna talk about that right now.
What I am gonna say is this...

Right...?
The death of my father, caused me to repulse the idea of money
being the thing that motivates me to do what I do, or think the
way that I think, but most people in our society...?

They revolve- the entire thing that they think about, or what
motivates them...? Is dollar signs. Dollar signs. Is what causes-
Is what motivates most people.

10:14
Right...?
But- ya know, after like uh- suffering the loss of my father and
everything, I really spent a number of years just kind of like, 
distancing myself from the way that everybody else thinks.

And like, I've made so many observations that most people would never
pick up on, because- like, they're controlled by this concept of like,
money and like, being more important than one another.

And like, uh- ya know, uh- having things to show for their success and
everything, right...?

10:50
So like, case in point. Um, there's this video of like a couple of kids,
well, they're not kids, they're like adults. And they got like uh- I 
dunno, they have like uh- like, jewelry on their teeth or whatever...

And it's... really stupid looking...?
Right...? But- they're rich.
They are stupid rich.

I don't know how much money they have, but- ya know, a lot of people in
society...? They envy them.

11:21
Right...? They think that like, what they do is COOL...?
And then like, that's why they're rich and everything...?
And like they can literally just uh- ya know, take piles of cash, throw
it in a dumpster, and light it on fire...?

And they'll still have plenty more, to waste.
Right...?

11:40
But like, uh- most people in society, if they see somebody like,
taking a shitload of cash, and throwing it in a dumpster and lighting
it on fire...? Most people will freak the fuck out.

They'll be like:
[People]: What are you doing burning all that cash...?!?
          Oh my god~!

Right...? But-

12:00
Ya know, take a step back from what causes that cash to be made, and
then you realize that like, heh.

A lot of things are wasted and destroyed, in order to create all of those
dollars. But I mean, like, further to that point, like, a lot of what 
backs- uh, our money system, is [bullshit].

Which is why I spoke about [fractional reserve lending].
Right...? [Fractional reserve lending] is an idea that like, our monetary
system is [overprovisioned].

12:27
Ya know, back in the old days, uh- people would, uh- uh- my friend Eric
told me about all this, but like- the way he that he defined it was
something that I was already talking to him about, but he wasn't like, 
paying attention to the words that I was saying, so like-

He- he kept telling me that I was like an idiot, to describe it the way
that I was describing it, or that like, I didn't describe it the way
that he understood it.

12:51
But basically, it's like this.
If there is, like, somebody that owns a gar- a [bar of gold]...?
And they wanna like, use it to like, trade for goods or services or 
whatever...?

They'll take the bar of gold, and they'll bring it to the blacksmith,
right...? And then, the blacksmith will just hang onto it, because,
like, the person doesn't wanna carry the gold around because of how
heavy it is.

And, because of how valuable it is.

13:17
Right...? The [blacksmith] is [tough]...
He can make [weapons] out of [metal]...?
And he can basically tell people to [eat a dick], if need be...?

And that's the idea of uh- like keeping uh- [security].
Ya know...? [Security] involves like [weapons], and [tough guys].

13:36
Not necessarily [smart guys]...?
But [tough guys] and [weapons].
Ya know...?

Mind meaning though we're in the modern age now, where security has taken
on a totally different context, um...

But uh-
Anyway, uh- suppose that somebody uh- that uh- wants to trade some of the
gold that they gave to the blacksmith, uh- for like, I dunno, like a horse
and carriage or somethin'.

14:05
Um- now, compound that by like uh- hundreds or thousands of people in a
village, they all have like, a piece of that- gar- bar of gold...?

That they own...? So that they can trade it around and stuff...?
And like, what you'll find out, is basically, um...

The gold- the blacksmith got to a point where like:
[Blacksmith]: Alright, how about I just issue a note, for that piece of gold...
              Because, if- not all of these people are gonna come back, and
              take the gold out at the same time, or whatever...?
              In order to trade it around...?

14:40
Cause basically what would happen is like, somebody would take the gold,
and then they'd tran- they'd- they'd give it to the other person, and then
the other person would give the- the goods or service or whatever, back...?

And then they would take- the person would take the gold, and bring it back
to the [blacksmith].

14:54
So like, the person that originally had the gold, would keep it with the
[blacksmith], they'd take it out, from the [blacksmith], and then they would
go trade the gold for the thing, and then the other person would come back
with that same bar of gold, and then holy shit, there it is.

15:06
So, the blacksmith caught onto this, and started overprovisioning- excuse
me, overprovisioning the uh- amount of gold, that could be provisioned.

It's basically [bullshit].

That's what I mean, is the- that's what [overprovisioning] and 
[fractional reserve lending] is, is- it's [bullshit].

The stuff that backs money...?
Is just, like, [inflated like a balloon].

15:29
Ya know, you take the original balloon, right...?
And then you blow, like, [hot air] into it, which is basically the
same thing as [bullshit], [hot air] and [bullshit]...

And then you blow it into the balloon, and then the balloon it- it
takes up a lot more volume... because it [expanded].

It [expanded].

15:50
And like, uh- once you like try to take the balloon back...?

Like, [somebody owns that entire balloon], but- it's been provisioned
to a whole bunch of other people by the [blacksmith], uh- then you
pop it, and then all that hot air goes to waste.

So like, that's the idea of what our economy is backed by.
A lot of fuckin' hot air.

Right...? So...
Thinking about how uh- this applies to... like uh- my father being killed
when I was 10 years old...?

Uhm, I think that there were other motivating factors for my father being
killed, and... that those motivating factors had very little to do with
money.

16:39
It had more to do with the fear of death, by somebody else.
Or, I dunno. I could be wrong about some of these uh- uh- suspicions of
mine, I could be wrong...

And that is something that the police often, uh- fail to say out loud.
Right...? They hate to say this out loud, like:
[Police]: I could be wrong about this...

Because then people would be like:
[People]: Well then you ARE wrong...

17:07
Right...? And uh- 
It comes down to like when people know their rights...?

Uh- it's not unlike the hot air balloon...?
Or the balloon with the hot air in it...?

Right, the police will come around...?
They'll assume that somebody doesn't know their rights...?
And so like, their power is basically an inflated balloon...?

Right? And then you say like uh-
[You]: Nah, look I know what my rights are, and basically like
       you're not obeying protocol...?
    
Right, and the police- sometimes the police will say uh:
[Cop]: You're correct about like uh- what you know...
       Et cetera and so forth...
       But, I'm still gonna, ya know, just uh- just
       push ya outta the way here...?
       Just cause I have to...
       You know...?
       Standard operating procedure, is to just ignore
       your rights, and then just do whatever...?

17:51
Right...?
That's what happened, like, with me and this guy from SCSO, 
K. Rossi... back on, [February 26th, 2023] at the [Market 32]
in [Clifton Park], right...?

I told him...

18:08
Uh- that uh- ya know, I'm not gonna cover the whole concept at
length here, but uh- what I am gonna say is this... right...?

Being intelligent does not equate to becoming rich or successful.
In some cases, being intelligent causes people that had mommy and
daddy, hand down their riches to their, ignorant children, to
give them more control. So if you like, embarrass them or humiliate
them, they will use mommy and daddy's money vault of doom...
...to be able to uh- force their will upon other people.
And that is what the police tend to- tend to take orders from.

18:56
So like, if you ARE intelligent enough to like, tell the police officers
that aren't doing their jobs correctly, that:
[You]: You're doin' your jobs incorrectly...

...what they'll do is: 
[Cop]: I can't be wrong, cause you know...
       somebody's thrown me a stack of cash, 
       or thrown me an order... 
       and I can't disobey that order...
       even if it is wrong, or illegal for me to do this...
       so, I have to do this.

19:19
And then so like, that is what causes so many problems in our society.
Right...? I'm not gonna go around and try to like, uh- blast individual
uh- police officers over and over again, unless...

Like, they [repeat this behavior].
By making some of these audio recordings, I can uh- detail an account
for things that have happened to me in my life, because I know that like
no matter how many recordings I make of the police, and- uh- sounding...

19:46
They don't understand, how to do their job as well as I do in many cases, 
right...? What- the problem is that like, most other people, they'll think
that I'm either bullshitting them, or they'll say:

[People]: Yeah but you're not a police officer, so you can't possibly be
          correct about any of that...

20:05
Some people WILL have this mentality. Right...?
It's because, like, this uh- idea of uh- money, it causes people to drop
their guard, and think that like, you need to have more money in order
to be more important.

Uh- sure. Ok.

20:23
But you know, further to that point, like, our government like, encourages this mentality, 
and uh- many of the people in the press or the news agencies...?

And many corporations...? They encourage this behavior too.

Which is problematic because then it causes this uh- this uhm, conflict of interest.
Right...?

20:50
So, the interest is, that everybody wants to keep this hot air inside the balloon.

No- they don't- they wanna prevent anybody from poppin' that baloon open, not unlike
how like when a cell divides, like uh- when cells are reproducing they divide right
down the middle and stuff, right...?

21:08
Well, uh- that's what this whole system is attempting to do, is to prevent the cell from dividing.
Or, from collapsing, I should say... right?

So, um, the entire world would devolve into chaos if the monetary system did fail,
however, there doesn't seem to be enough effort on uh- like uh- going around
and popping people's balloons... 

21:34
Right...? Or like what'll happen is like, people will get like uh- they'll try to get like, their house
or their property evaluated...?

Right...? And then when they do, they'll find out that like, hey, the house...?

Nah, I was just thinkin' about this earlier, actually, like...

21:53
And people will uh- go and buy like a (400,000) dollar house or somethin', right...?
And they'll be like:
[Somebody]: Wow, wow, look at my (400,000) dollar house.
            Wow, it's such a cool house.
            Wow.

And then they'll tell all their friends, and they'll have like a house warming party, 
or like a christening party, or whatever...? Right...?

And then like...

22:14
Now they're all there, they're in the brand new (400,000) dollar house, right...?
And then all of a sudden...?
[Bruce Tanski] builds a (600,000) dollar house across the street, and then the
neighbors are like:

[Neighbors] Hey, hey, look at our brand new (600,000) dollar house~!

And then like, the people that bought the (400,000) dollar house, they're like:

[400K]: Yeah, you're- you- you might have a c- a house that's worth like 
        (600,000) dollars, but- ya know, it looks stupid compared to my
        (400,000) dollar house...

And then the people with the (600,000) dollar house will be like:
[600K]: Yeh, uhm, nah nah, it's just your opinion that the s- our house,
        looks, stupid, compared to yours. Ya know, your house, it- it looks
        cheaper.

22:53
And then they'll be like:
[400K]: Well it's just your opinion that my house looks cheaper than your...
        uh- lame-looking house.

Right...? And then so like, people will keep these things inside, right...?
Not realizing that like there's very little, visual difference between the 
(400,000) dollar house, and the (600,000) dollar house.

23:12
Yeah, one of em might have like an indoor pool or something, and like, I dunno.
Like, I dunno.

It is...
It might have like a couple extra bedrooms, and it might have like a third bay
in the garage or something lame like that. And they'll be like that's the 
(600,000) dollar house and the (400,000) dollar house. Right...?

23:34
So like- what I can say for certain, is that like most houses...?
Uh- the raw materials to build, like a (400,000) or (600,000) dollar house...?

It's like, (20,000) dollars.
For the raw materials.
If not, less.

A lot of it goes into the labor, but it- also, a lot of it is uh- like uh- the
inspections, and like making sure the engineering and blueprints are on par, or
snuff or whatever...?

And that like, people aren't makin' mistakes...?
And that like, they have to go back and like level things...?
And make sure everything's like, measured correctly...?
And that it fits according to plan, and it fits like, somebody's like- uh...

24:19
I dunno. It- it fits every... box or requirement that is expected of it...?
And then uh- once all of that is said and done...?

Right...? Then they can start bragging about how much their house costs,
or what they could sell it for.

24:37
Ya know, houses typically uh- when they're resold, they maintain their value,
where like if you buy a car, most cars lose value, unless of course you buy
like a really well built car...

Or, a car that like, has been bought from a reputable company like-

Ya know, if you buy like a Chevy Malibu, 2023- I dunno if they make the
Malibu anymore, but- you buy a Chevy Malibu 2023, right...?

As soon as- for like, I dunno, (30) grand...?
As soon as you drive it off of the lot...?
It loses like (5) grand in value...

25:20
So even if you drive it right off the lot, and you drive it right back...?
You're only gonna get like (25,000) dollars back outta that (30) grand.

Right...?
But- lets say you buy a Lamborghini.

As soon as you drive that Lamborghini off of the lot...?
Uh- it still has, it's pretty close to the same value.

Why is that the case...?
Well it's because, a lot of cars are made to break down, they're
engineered to break down, so if you spend more money on a vehicle,
they will engineer it better.

But if you spend less money on a vehicle...?
They will give you a box of bolts and shit.
Loosely connected...?
And every single bump and, and crack in the road is gonna cause those
bolts and lags to start to like, ya know, like uh- loosen up.

Oh boy.

26:17
Yeah, so like, these are the things that uh- go into like keeping value.
It- it, and uh- ya know, like uh- this coffee shop that I was going to
for a while, they have like a bunch of paintings there, right...?

And uh- the paintings all have like an estimated value.
You wanna buy this painting...?
Here's the author of the painting...?
Here's how much the painting costs...?
And uh- ya know...?

The paintings aren't bad.
But- those paintings are prolly gonna stick there- stay there for a while.

Mainly because, like, it's not the proper setting to sell art.

26:53
Though, I might be like uh- I might not be correct about that, maybe 
some time- at- at some point in time, someone will come along, and they'll
be like:
[Someone]: I'd like to buy this painting right here...

And then the coffee shop will be like:
[Shop]: Really...?

And they'll be like:
[Someone]: Yeh yeh yeh, I wanna buy the painting, I wanna buy the painting.

27:10
And then uh- they buy the painting, and then they like- they brag about it.
They're like:
[Someone]: Look at this, awesome painting that I got at the coffee shop.
           You know, it's amazing...

And then, people'll be like:
[People]: Wow.
          That's a pretty cool painting.
[Someone]: It is, it is a pretty cool painting.

Because somebody put a lot of time and effort into making that painting.
And, what I can say, further to that point, is that somebody put more
time and effort into that painting, than some of these cars that like
GM makes.

Right...?

27:41
And uh- heh. Like they got to a point where like they just slowly, make
the cars, like have these design flaws that cost a lot of money or time
to fix...? Or both...?

And then uh- same thing goes with the houses.
Though, I think the houses tend to last a lot longer, uh- in general.

It's not a consistent case.
Modular homes and even like, mobile homes, those tend to degrade pretty
quickly even if they are brand new... right, and uh-

28:15
That's mainly becuase uh- ya know, the foundation does tend to matter.
But also, the materials.
Uhm, the idea behind like, uh- like- a layer of roofing is that it'll 
last a generation, right...?

So I think- I don't think, [Chad] was taking a page from [Star Trek]
when he decided to name his company [Next Generation Roofing].

Nah, I think what he was doing was trying to make it- make his- the
name of his company be the sales point.

[Chad]: You know what...?
        When you get a roofing job from US...?
        It's gonna last until the next generation.
        That's why it's [Next Generation Roofing].

28:57
Right...? And uh- it's such a simple idea, to like, make a sales
point about the name of the business.

That uh- it- it- really, it's like uh- a no- practically a no brainer.
But- ya know, I wanna take away from uh- like uh- a lot of the points
that I- I wanna walk back, from many of the points I made, and talk
specifically about how uh- it- it- regardless of the facts...?

29:24
Like, everybody in society...?
They do this uh- this thing where, every decision that they make, is 
meant to like, put more money in their pocket somehow, rather than to 
like, uh- increase the value of the things that they're doing.

29:43
Right...?
A lot of people- uh- they struggle to identify with, what is it that
gives- excuse me, they struggle to identify with uh- like, the reason
why the paintings, why they get the value that they do, or why, a
house gets the value that it does. Or why, uh- a vehicle will get the
value that it does. Right...?

30:05
Uhm, each of these things that I've rattled off, their value is determined
through some means. Right...? Wi- with a house...? Uh, you'll get someone
who comes, and they give the house an appraisal. And it costs money to
have them do this, they need to spend a fair amount of time being able to
do it... and uh- typically, if you invite a house appraisal- uh- appraiser
to a house that's like, not picture perfect or whatever...?

30:34
They won't even like, continue to appraise the house or nothin'.
Nah, they'll just see it, and they'll be like: 
[Appraiser]: This house is shit.
             I'm outta here.

So if it's not picture perfect, they will literally...
they won't say those words, but their actions will say it.

They'll be like: 
[Appraiser]: Oh, uh- ya know, I think that uh- I uh-I think that...

I dunno, I really, I'm not gonna try to like, come up with 
something on their behalf or whatever, but- uhm...

31:09
People in society, they do this, where uh- they judge each other based
on possessions, rather than like uh- like how intelligent they are, or
what they have to offer...?

People judge each other based on their possessions.
It's- it's plain and simple, that is what a lot of people in our society
do. So like if uh- if somebody owns property...?

31:34
And they have a house or a bunch of stuff ont he property, and it's all
shit, but they still own the property...? Ya know, and the person could
be really, like, not very intelligent at all...? But like, then somebody
who's like, really smart...? Like uh- had their father murdered when 
they were a kid, who like continues to make a bunch of content, where he
sounds very sophisticated and he's trying to educate other people...

Well, for whatever reason, our society will still give preference to the
idiot who owns a whole bunch of property, over the person that sounds
sophisticated and is attempting to teach people everything, about like 
how flawed our society is...

And the reason that they do it, is because...
...this is what the schools teach people to do.

32:26
Right...?
So when people pay their taxes, they're paying the schools to educate
their children to judge each other based on their possessions. Ya know,
if somebody doesn't possess anything...?

Then that means that they're a loser.

That is what the schools teach the children.
In our country.
And in other countries.

It's what our society teaches people.
If somebody doesn't have possessions...?
Then they're a scumbag.

32:59
Right...?

But- at some point in the future, the concept behind money, is gonna
be replaced by, a concept that they had back in 1776. 

Like, bartering... 
Bartering and sharing stuff. 

Ya know, uh- gluttony is a [very serious problem].
[Gluttony] and uh- riches.

I don't wanna say that like, everybody that is a rich person,
or wealthy, that uh- they have a negative connotation of 
[gluttony] going on...

33:40
However, it is one of the seven deadly sins.
I'm not gonna really talk about the seven deadly sins so much, 
because, uhm- really what they all devolve into, is like these
ideas of like envy, jealousy, uhm, deception- uh, like murder,
and things like that.

[Basic human instincts].
Where like, [you don't wanna be killed]...? 
Then, so like, [don't kill anybody else].

The golden rule, treat other people as you would like to be treated.

However, uh- some people see that as a one-way street.

34:14
Right...? As soon as they have like a title...?
They forget about like, the idea behind like, uh- treating people as
equals and treating them with respect... no matter whether they have
possessions or not...?

Or, no matter whether they're an idiot or not...
Right...?

So, um, often times what'll happen is uh- people will just go along
with the whole show, because like, some people have something to show
for like, what they've worked for...?

And like, they didn't need to be like super duper intelligent to earn
like all the things that they earned in their life...? But- ya know,
what they earned took a certain amount of time for them to earn those
things, right...?

And uh...

35:04
There are so many scams and systems in play, that cause people to not
even realize that they've been fooled, in virtually every instance
where uh- ya know someone's signing their life away.

Typically this has a lot to do with uh- like, I dunno, mortgages.
Or uh- car payments.
Or car loans.
Or student loans.
Right...?

35:28
So, um, president Joe Biden thinks that it would be a good idea to 
[eliminate student debt]. And [I agree].

But- do you know who doesn't think it's a good idea to 
[eliminate student debt]...?

Uh- the banks that like, issued the debt.
To all the people that took out student loans and stuff.

The reason being, is it gives them ability to uh- earn uh- interest
on the [principle balance].

36:01
Right...? So like, they have all these systems set up to where like uh-
most- a lot of people that go to school...?

They wind up uh- getting a job.
But that's not a consistent case, many times, people will go to school
and they won't get a job that like furthers their, uh- I dunno, uh-
furthers their, career or whatever.

36:33
Right...? And uh- ya know, there's something at play here, where a lot
of people are getting bamboozled, and it allows like, certain people to
become very successful, and a lot of other people to be shafted...?

And uh- what you're left with is that like, our entire like, system has
a number of illusions at play, where... like- some people that are rich
or powerful or wealthy, they want like, obedient servants to be, uh paid
for their hard work.

They don't wanna pay people that are like willing to compete, with uh
their business model, or thier source of revenue, or their source of power...?

37:30
Like if I go around and I expose a whole bunch of things like, uh [Joe Manchin].
Li- or uh- P- [Paul] or [Joe], I can't remember his first name, it's either
[Paul] or [Joe].

Uh- he's like:
[Manchin]: I don't want the [student loan] thing, at all...
           the [student loan forgiveness package of doom].
           Nah, I'm gonna work really hard to prevent that from making it in.
           And it doesn't matter what the number is...?
           I'm just gonna continue to go in front of the cameras, and say
           that like, uh- the number wasn't agreeable.

38:05
Mainly because, um, there are a number of lobbyists or whatever they call
the people that like pay the people in the government that run for office...?

Like, to shut the hell up, and vote for their agenda...?
Right...?
So a lot of the people in the government, they're like a [puppet].
They're there, because like some rich people put them into that office,
because they're gonna wind up doing their bidding.

38:31
Right...? So, this isn't a consistent case, but it's consistent enough
to where you can see- like there- w- whether you know who's involved in
what...? You can sort of like, uh- aggregate like, ok...

If uh, there's an investor out there, or some rich billionaire that
doesn't like the idea of student loan forgiveness...? And uh- Joe Manchin
doesn't like the idea of student loan forgiveness...?

That like, uh- maybe uh- it's worth researching whether or not that rich
person like, had anything to do with [Joe Manchin] getting into office, 
and uh whether they have any [communications] with one another.

39:12
So these are the sort of things you might be able to see or aggregate
at a comp- or a place like the [National Security Agency], or like
[Verizon], or like any sort of [telecommunications company].

Right...?
So like, if uh- it comes down to like, [Joe Manchin] and some rich
billionaire keeping a secret or whatever, then they have to make sure
that a whole bunch of people, in the [law enforcement system] and the
[justice system], like they're all paid their salaries, right...?

In order to like,uh- perpetuate this idea of uh- like, ya know everything
that I've described so far, ya know, should very clearly, like describe
or like outline, like uh- how devious some people are in our uh- country
and economy, right...?

40:05
So... Now, I gotta uh- like uh- unwind this like a- a fair amount, because
I don't think that everybody with a lot of money does this...

They might do certain things to a certain extent, but I really don't think
that they all like, violate people's rights, or they like, manipulate the 
system or uh- the politics, politi- politics all that much...

Right...?
They might like, make an appearance every once in a while, they might
say somethin', like [Larry Elliston]. I think that's his name...

The guy uh- the CEO of [Oracle], [Larry Ellison].

40:47
Like, uh- he's not the type of dude that I think, he's goin' around,
doin' the shit that I just described.

Ya know, he- he- uh- he did well for himself with [Oracle], and [Oracle]
does a lot of cool stuff. And uh- they basically did a lot- they have a
lot of overlapping, uh- roles with uh- [Microsoft]...

Right...? And uh-

41:13
Ya know, [Oracle] is nothing to joke about.
They're uh- they're a big company, and I find it really hard to believe, 
that uh- a guy like [Larry Ellison], would go around, like paying people
to like uh- say no to the [student loan forgiveness] thing.

41:33
However, uhm, there are a lot of people that could never, ever, ever, come
close to like the success of [Microsoft] or [Oracle], that like, they have like
thousands of friends that are friends with governors all around the country
in each state... And like, they're sort of people that would like, be cool
with uh- the idea of uh- all (50) states making parts for the [F-35]...

42:01
Right...? Sort of like, uh- somebody suckin' on somebody's teat.
That's- That's- that's the idea behind money, is that somebody has to suck on
SOMEBODY's fuckin' teat somewhere... Right...?

And, uh- I'm not against the idea of money, what I'm against is like, how the
idea of money causes certain people to think of like, stupid fuckin' shit to
stay rich, or to get rich, and screw over as many people as they can, as long
as they do it without them knowing that they're screwing them over, or if they
DO know it, like uh- they have to like, they have to sign the dotted line, and
like uh- hit the checkbox or whatever.

42:42
Ya know, it's like:
[Somebody]: Initial here.
            Initial there...
            Initial there...
            And then read all the fine-
            Do- Ah, you don't wanna read all the fine print.
            Don't rea- eh.
            I mean, if you wanna read the fine print...?
            Go ahead, read the fine print.
            But I mean, like, you want that fuckin' nice car right there,
            or you want that nice house...?
            Right...?
            Yeh yeh yeh, alright.
            Well, read the- 
            Eh.
            You don't need to read the fine print then, ya know...?
            You're gettin' what you want~!

Right...?
And as soon as that person gets what they want...

They don't realize that like, they're taking on the responsibility of like, 
turning- like- their forseeable future...

43:20
...is paying off the car payments or the house payments or mortgage...

And then like, all of the unexpected things that happen in the future...?
Will likely cause them to like, uhm, derail.

There's a lot of things in life that happen that are unexpected, right...?
So, this happens to [most people] and it's why a lot of things are risky.

There's no way to really guarantee anything, that involves some level of 
risk... Right...?

This is something that [Edward Snowden] talks about, with [John Oliver].

[Snowden]: The only time that you're like, eliminating risk, is when
           you're in prison.

43:56
But even that, that's not even true, because you could be shanked, by
somebody in the prison.

But- um, ya know, the- the idea that I'm alluding to, is specifically,
uhm, I wanna sk- walk back to the conv- the point that I just made, again, 
but I lost it.

Uh- how like uh- so, people will insure, like uh- the student loan company,
and it wi- it will basically- they- the companies and the people that place
their bets, they place bets, right...?

44:39
So like, they know that the odds are, that most people that get a student
loan, they're not gonna- like, be able to do a whole lot with it or whatever,
and like uh- they're gonna take on this added debt responsibility, but 
they're not gonna get like, much in the way of like uh- compensation for
all of their hard work or their trip to school or whatever, right...?

45:04
And so like, the companies that issue these loans, they'll have predatory
lending practices even, ya know, this is something that [ITT Tech] like uh-
experienced, uhm...

And uh- what happens is uh- the people that like invest in the student loans,
they make a lot of money off of like, people not finishing to pay their
student loan debts. Basically it's like a residual, it's like residual income.

45:35
When they don't pay their- their loan payments.
Right...? So like, what happens is this.

Uh- they're able to uh- place bets, on whether some individual will finish
shcool and finish paying off their loans, or... whether they won't.

And uh- the way they have it set up, is that it- it's not unlike car payments
and their cars being- people's cars being repossessed, and the banks having to 
like, recoup their money somehow...? And like, the insurance comapnies also 
getting involved in this...? Right...?

46:09
All of these industries, have like a [circle of fifths] going on, where like, 
even if the person cannot pay for the, the thing...? Or they don't have
collateral for it...?

They've posted up, like everything they need to come clean on their end.
And to get their- their money back, or their interest.

And that is the reason why, if Joe Biden, like, cancels- like, goes around
and forgives student loans and stuff...? 

A lot of people that were getting residual checks, for people not finishing
the payment of their loans and stuff...? They're not gonna get that 
interest anymore if the loans are forgiven.

46:49
No... so like, it basically, it violates their entire corrupt system.
And, believe it or not, but there are like a ton of industries that do this
shit.

Though like, I don't know the particulars, I just know that like, it's
happening to a lot of people. Where, people can easily get a loan- a student
loan to go to school and stuff, right...?

But if they want a business loan, for their business...?
Then, they're basically told to fuck off, because...

47:24
You gotta have like uh-
You gotta have (100) rings...?
From like, [Sonic the Hedgehog 2]...?
You gotta have the [(7) Chaos Emeralds]...?
You gotta like, jump, after you collect at least (50) rings...?
And then you gotta turn into [Super Sonic], and you got the
blonde hair, you're not the blue hedgehog anymore...
You're the fuckin', you're the- uh, [Super Saiyan] lookin' hedgehog...

47:47
Your hair's all blonde, or whitish...?
You look like a meaner version of yourself...?
And uh- you're not even, your feet aren't even touchin' the ground 
anymore, you're just gliding above the ground, and you're flyin' 
around like [Superman], basically.

And uh- then like at that point...?
Then uh- you have to go through the whole game...?
And beat Dr. Robotnik about (8)- (12) times...?

(12) times...?

48:12
Uh- you have to beat, [Dr. Robotnik]'s stupid fuckin', uh-
boss...? Uh- the first level boss...? And then like, the-
then you get to fight [Dr. Robotnik] himself, in one of his
stupid fuckin' machines and stuff... 

And then, uh- then you go onto the next stage, then you do this
for like, ya know, (12) stages, and then on like the last few
stages...? You have like uh- like a THIRD stage... So like, 
the second stage becomes like another stupid robot...? Maybe
the same stupid robot that you beat in the first stage, again...?

And then, uh- the third...? Uh- the third one, then you finally
fight [Dr. Robotnik], and he'll be like:
[Dr. Robotnik]: Ha ha ha, you're fucked now, [Sonic]...

But, you're [Super Sonic], so like, you can literally just fuckin'
jump around like a fuckin' nutcase...? And nobody can really do
anything about it...? Not even him...?

And then like, you destroy like, after you hit him (8) times...?
You destroy his stupid fuckin' lame ass robot, again...?

And, then his robot falls apart, and then, like, he might like, run
off like an idiot, or he might like uh- get into uh- his uh- doom ship.

49:23
And then you gotta fly through the sky...? With Tails...?
And then you gotta like, uhm, you gotta like fl- jump from platform to
platform...

I'm basically describing [Sonic the Hedgehog 2], but like, ya know...

Then, uhm, then you have to meet up with [Mario], and then uh- then uh-
you gotta tell [Mario]...

Hey [Mario], you need to collect all 125 stars...?
Then you gotta kick the shit out of [Bowser]...?

And then Mario does that...
And then, when Mario does that...?

Then [Super Mar-], [Super Sonic], and [Mario], they- they do the fist
bump of doom, and then it causes like an explosion, and then uh- an
explosion of coolness, and then what happens is uh- then you get like, uh

50:09
What the hell's his name...? (Crash Bandicoot)
The Echidna...
I can't even remember his name.
From [Sony Playstation]. 

I can't remember the fuckin' name of the stupid thing...
He's not stupid, uh-

Anyway, uhm, the idea that I'm alluding to here, is this...
Is like, they really set up a lot of complicated things, that most
people are gonna fail to be able to do, because they didn't read
the fine print.

And reading the fine print is really important, because, ya know...?

If the fine print includes the description of everything that I just
fuckin' said...? You might be better off just playin' the fuckin'
game [Sonic the Hedgehog 2]...

50:55
And then like, beating [Dr. Robotnik], and collecting all the fuckin'
Chaos Emeralds, and then, eh- ya know, I'm making it- sound very long
winded and like complicated for a reason, right...?

51:11
It's basically like uh- the- the level of uh- treachery that some wealthy
people have established with the banking system, and the blacksmith of
doom on the other side of the planet that has an unlimited amount of 
gold that it can provision to people.

So basically, what causes some people to become more rich, is uh- other
people's misfortunes.

And, those misfortunes are basically like, ya know, preventing certain
people from like, having a- a- a modicum of success.

51:44
Right...? And uh- everybody has a different definition of what success
means. Does success mean that you're gonna have [billions of dollars]
like [Bill Gates], or [Elon Musk]...?

Well, a lot of people seem to think that.
But- ya know, that doesn't necessarily mean that, uh-

That doesn't necessarily mean that you cant find success in other ways,
so like, if you get to a point in your life where you've made all of 
the observations that I have, you can avoid going through the fuckin'
uh- number of uh- pitfalls that I found myself being uh- consumed by, 
as well as like many other people my generation...

52:25
Right...? And then you can start to focus on like what things people
will need in the future, when the entire system that we have now...?
It collapses.

Because like, there's a level of unsustainability with uh- our society
right now, there's a lot of things that are thrown away every day, 
there's a lot of people that like uh- they build the house and then
the house gets like, uh- repossessed...?

52:50
And then, in many cases like a house that like they- someone, like- if
someone gets a mortgage on a house, and they pay half of the mortgage, 
they don't get half of that money back, they don't get that money back
if they can't continue to pay it off...? No, they lose it all.

They forfeit it all.

53:08
Oh boy. They forfeit it all. Smae thing occurs with the cars. Right...?

And so, the idea behind like, collateral, is pretty important, because
like, you need to have enough collateral, in order to like, convince
somebody to like, place a bet, and see the odds as like, in their favor.

Because if the odds are in their favor, and then they win out big time,
you can bet your ass that they're gonna go ahead and bet, very easily.

But if the odds are AGAINST them...?
You can bet your ass that they'll spend money, to like, find some way to
fuck you over.

53:57
Ohhhhhh... so that's what our society is like, uh- heh. That's what it
devolves to, is... finding ways to screw people over without having to
openly admit that that's what they're doing.

It's what a lot of people do...?
But- ya know, like- screwing other people over, ya know, to what level,
do they do this...?

Do they send a team of hitmen with rifles and knives to like, come gut
you like a fish...? Well, in some cases that'll be the military that
does that.

54:25
But- ya know, they're not gonna send the military after a fuckin' citizen
that's not payin' his student loans, no. If anything, what they'll do is, 
they'll try to send like a bunch of police officers to like, smear somebody's
record a thousand times, instead of like uh- doing their job correctly.

And what they'll do, is they'll drag their feet, and, it'd basically be like
uh- ya know, uh- like a full-grown man, going to the island with a bunch of
kids in uh what was it, uh- what was the name of that book...

55:05
Uh, [Lord of the Flies]...?
Right...? You go to the island [Lord of the Flies], and you're a full grown
adult, and all these kids on the island are tryin' to tell you what to do,
or whatever, and you're like:
[You]: Nah, dude...
       Uhm, ya- just shut the hell up...?
       Heh. You do what I tell ya to.

And it's like, they're like:
[Kids]: Nope, that's not how we do things on the island [Lord of the Flies].
        You're in trouble now...

55:33
That's basically a metaphor for like, how our government gets down.
Right...?

It's not a consistent case where like, everybody uh- they have smart people
in the government, and they have honest people in the government, too.

They also have some incredibly uh- douchebaggish people in the government.
They also have some very dangerous people in the government.
Right...?

55:52
And, they don't wanna openly admit these things...?
Uh, the poeople in the government, they know that they have like, some 
fuckin' shady trollmeisters amongst them, and they also know that they
have more integrity than like, a lot of people in society...? So like...

They have to like, get along with each other like, I dunno.
I really don't know how to describe it, but- you know, like uh-

Our entire society is full of people that uh- they- they mix and match
like uh- what their values are.

56:24
So, what I can say is this, what gives the paintings their value, is
not just the amount of time that uh- a person put into painting the 
painting, but also like, how much time they put into developing the
skills to be able to envision the idea within the painting.

56:42
Right, and so like, uh- I was looking at this one painting, and it had
a reflection, and in a- it was basically a picture, of a pond within the
woods, and on the surface of the water you could see a reflection of 
like uh- uh- a- the sky, or the trees and stuff...? And I thought that
was pretty cool.

57:02
Right...? But- um, when it comes to an appraisal of a car, it really just
comes down to like, reading up a god damn blue book, and just determining
whether the car is screwed up... Right...?

Uhm, and then also, uh- when it comes to appraising a house, the quickest
way that they can appraise a house, is bylike, taking a look at it, and
seeing if its like perfect from the outside.

57:33
If it's not perfect from the outside, they're gonna tell ya "Bye."
If it is perfect from the outside, then they'll take a look inside, and
then they'll look to see if the aesthetics match up, and the measurements
are level, and this that and the other thing...?

57:49
And they'll get very, uh- into the nitty gritty of like, how uh- everything
appears, [appearances]. How things [appear].

And that's what they will work with.
How things [appear].

Because, underneath everything that appears before their very eyes, they'll
be able to determine whether or not things are structurally sound.

In many cases there could be problems hiding in plain sight, but- as long
as everything looks perfect, then it doesn't matter.

58:17
And, then they can, like evaluate this (400,000) dollar house, to be worth 
(400,000) dollars. Right...? And uh- ya know, owning a house costs money,
so it's not just paying for the house itself, but like it also uh- can- it 
also uh- requires like maintaining the house, and keeping it in order, and
uh- there's a lot of money that goes into being a homeowner.

But- ya know, once somebody is stuck within a home, and then you like try 
to uh- do the same thing that [Morpheus] does to [Neo] in [The Matrix], ya
know some people will realize "Holy fucking shit."

...when they're knee deep in the middle of a car payment, or a student loan,
or a mortgage, or a having some level of repair or whatever done...?

And like, they just write it off, they're just like:
"Well, whatever dude. There's nothing I can do about it, I'm stuck."

59:19
Right, and someone else basically owns that person.
They don't see it that way, because they see themselves as the owner of the
house, or the car, or uh- the student loan...? 
Or the education or whatever...?

But- someone else owns that person, and until they pay off the house,
they're stuck right in the middle of a fuckin', like, they're basically
turning their life into uh- someone elses' wealth.

And the amount of time they spend doing whatever the hell they do, and
our society is full of this, ya know...?

59:52
It's like, unless you get to- you could make it (29) years and (6) months 
into a mortgage payment, but like if you break both your legs in the last
(6) months, and you've got no way to pay the- the remaining balance of the 
mortgage or whatever, and you can't get it like, uhm, you can't get the 
balance like uh- refinanced or whatever...?

They will come and repossess the house, and the (29) and a half years that
someone spent, dutifully paying their mortgage...?

They lose out like over like, less than like (2) percent, of like, eh-
maybe like less than a fraction of a percent, of uh- the remaining balance 
that they had left to pay.

01:00:37
Which is a tragedy, because heh. 
Ya know, it's all or nothing.

It's basically a game, and uh- there are so many uh layers of deception 
involved in uh- ya know, whether it's owning a car, or whether it's owning
a house, or whether it's owning- really, even property.

Eh, because owning property, you have to pay the taxes on the property.
You have to pay the taxes to the schools...?
And the schools teach the kids how to like, ya know, uh- basically
everything I've explained in this whole audio log.

01:01:24
That is what they teach the kids at the school.

Ya know, they do teach them a lotof helpful things in life, I'm not
discounting that. But they also like teach them things to where they
have to make certain assumptions as to what they're being educated about.

So like, if somebody's who's good looking, and uh- ya know, liked by
a lot of other kids in their class...? 

They're gonna be, like, uh- they're gonna be, respected by the other kids.
And the other kids are gonna be like:

[Kids]: Hey, uh- you know, uh- we think you're cool...? 
        And we want you to be the leader of the debate club and everything...?

And then the leader of the debate club goes around, tellin' everybody:
[Leader]: Hey, I'm gonna be like uh- uh- the mayor of the town.
          I'm gonna clean this town up.

01:02:04
And then what they do, is they wind up, doin' uhm, they wind up like uh-
backpedaling on thier campaign promises, because someone came along and
they were like:

[Someone]: Hey.
           How would you like to, ya know, be freed of the chains of
           humanity...?

And they'll be like:
[Leader] : Well, what the hell do you mean freed of the [chains of humanity]...?
[Someone]: Freed of the [chains of humanity] means that like, I'm gonna throw
           you such a large stack of cash, that you'll never ever ever have to
           worry about paying a mortgage, or a car loan, or uh- a student loan...
           ...ever again.

01:02:43
And then they'll be like:
[Leader] : Well... uhm, hell yeah< I would like that a lot~!

And then they'll be like:
[Someone]: Alright, so, go ahead and sign your soul away, right now.

And then, that's what they do.
They sign their fucking soul away.

And then, they basically become a puppet, of somebody with a lot
of cash that told em what to do, and how to do it, how high to jump,
and then they become that person's property.

01:03:10
Believe it or not.
The coolest kid in class, becomes another person's property, and then
like the coolest kid in class, like he drives around in this really
cool car all the time...?

He's got a (400,000) dollar house, or a (600,000) dollar house, and like
uh- ya know, like, he has to keep up appearances, and like if he ever
comes across somebody as intelligent as like [Michael Cook], he's 
gonna run his fuckin' mouth and say:
[Leader]: That dude's a fuckin' douchebag.
          Ya know...?
          He always has been...?
          Always will be...?
          His father was a douchebag too...?
          Fuck that guy, that dude's a fuckin' douchebag.

01:03:45
Right, and the reason that they do it is because, like, they
have [no control over it]. They really don't.

Ya know...? They'll say "No, I definitely have control over it..."
But- ya know, like, [actions speak louder than words].

Ya know...?
And that is how our entire society works.

01:04:03
Ya know, I'm goin' all the way back down to like, the primal roots of
how humans evolve and everything, right...?

At the end of the day, this entire system is gonna collapse, mainly
because, like at some point, uh, the power- uh- grid, as well as the
telecommunications grid, at some point in the future, these things
are gonna be free again.

They're go- there's no way around it.
It WILL be free, power will be free, you'll be able to heat your home
and power your home, with [solar energy].

01:04:38
And then they'll have to like send people to go around and sabotage
people's solar panels, be like:
[People]: How dare you use renewable energy, you stupid son of a bitch...
          Nah, now your solar panels aren't workin'...
          How do you like that...?

Ya know, someone's gonna catch on really fuckin' quickly, and be like,
why the hell isn't my power lasting an entire day...? Or an entire week,
or an entire month...?

01:05:02
Ya know...? Not unlike when there's a hole in somebody's gas tank...?
They're not gonna get very far, when their car, uh- tank- their gas tank
has a hole in it, no way dude.

You're not- you're gonna be like, you're gonna be like
"Well, what the fuck...? I smell gas..."

Ya know, then you're gonna keep drivin, and then like, and you'll be like:
"Well dude, I fuckin' smell gas, and I didn't even like, open the gas can."

1:05:31
And then like, they're gonna get like, half the distance they normally
would, and be like "What the fuck is goin' on, dude...? I'm only gettin'
like (150) miles a tank...? This is bullshit..."

And basically, they won't know whether or not like, GM just sold them
another shit car...? That just suddenly stopped getting the mileage that
it was supposed to get...? Or, what was advertised...?

Or, some shady trollmeister somewhere, like, they turned a knob in the
engine compartment, so that the engine runs a little more rich, and then
it burns through the gasoline a lot faster.

01:06:07
And this might be something that a warranty uh- uh- someone like
[Northstar Chevrolet] would do, when you pay for a warranty.
The full bumper-to-bumper warranty 5000, and then you go to bring the car
in to get service, and then they say:
"Oh yeh, the car had all these problems, right...?"

And then they fixed all those problems, but-
The problem that you brought it there for, it still has that problem.

This is what [Northstar Chevrolet] did to me when I had my
[2004 Pontiac Grand Prix], ya know...?

Paid through the nose for that fuckin' vehicle, and I was upside down
in the car loan, when uh- the fuckin' engine, uh- died on me. I- I had
a year and a half worth of payments left, and my engine, it just died.

And then, uh- that was at like, (105,000) miles.
Or maybe it was the transmission that died first...
I can't remember.

01:07:01
But I know that the engine and transmission died in that vehicle, and
I had to get them both replaced, separately. Ya know the car made it
about (280,000) miles, would've been able to drive the car to the moon,
with that fuckin' thing.

But, you know uh- General Motors designs their vehicles to break down,
and uh- ya know, there are so mny things in our society that are designed
to break down and produce waste, because... waste puts money into certain
people's pockets, and it takes opportunities away from other people.

01:07:37
And then they're told that like uh- ya- ya know, I'm not gonna get into
the nitty gritty of like uh- how uh- how deep the layers of deception
truly are...?

But what I can say is this, they do say that hindsight is 20/20.
Right...? Hindsight is 20/20.

So like, what- what they're basically saying, is like, you have to like,
be quick-witted enough to know what the hell's goin' on right in front of
you...?

And in order to do that, you have to know things ahead of time.
So, in order to know things ahead of time, you have to know what
someone else has done beforehand, and uh- their experience and their
education, and their life...? Right...? And, uh- 

They will work really hard to disillusion everybody from payin' attention
to somebody that's been around the fuckin' block...?

01:08:35
And has had all these fuckin' stupid scams happen to them...
Right...?

So, here's an analogy, uhm...
I've been puttin' like slices of pizza in a bag, right...?
And uh- this uh- my backpack has like I'll- I have- I'll occasionally
put like a can of uh- like uh cologne or whatever the hell it's called,
like body spray...

And uh, sometimes what'll happen is the top of it will like, break off,
and then it will like, spray out all over the inside of my backpack,
which- ya know, makes me smell- makes my backpack smell like uh- cologne
or body spray for a while, right...?

01:09:20
But- ya know, like, uh- the slices of pizza, when I go to heat them up,
they'll taste like the fuckin' the cologne, or the body spray. And I'm
sittin' there thinkin' "What the fuck...? Ya know...? How the hell did
it get through the bag...?"

Ya know, here's the best case that I can make.

When uh- dogs or canines that work for the police, they- they smell drugs
and stuff...? It works the same way as like, detecting bullshit that people
say. Right...? Uhm, like the smell permeates other substances, and it
carries forward like osmosis through a membrane.

01:10:01
So osmosis is sort of like how water will pass through a membrane, right...?
And uh- the way that it does it is because the molecules are able to pass
through, like, the thing in the middle. Typically it'll be like glass or 
it'll be like uh- what the hell, uhm, [plastic]...?

Glass or plastic...?
Right...?

It can also go through like uh- varying other membranes and stuff too, right?

01:10:33
But- ya know uh- the thick and thin of it is this...
Well, some people ar epretty stupid, and uh- they think that other people
are idiots. And like, when someone isn't an idiot, they'll actually single
that person out, if they're not playing along with the, the game that
everybody else is playing.

Right...? And then, like, everybody will work against this one person, 
that isn't like tied to the chains of humanity at all.

01:11:09
You know, the chains of humanity, is probably gonna be the name of this
audio log. [Chains of Humanity]... I like that idea.

The [Chains of Humanity], um- 
Is basically like this...
Possess-

Jesus Christ like, often prophesized about this, like uh-
possessions are chains. Ya know, having some possessions isn't like, bad
or evil or whatever...

01:11:39
But- I think, that a lot of people put a lot of emphasis on like, having stuff...
and like, if you don't have stuff...?
Then you're a loser.

And you wanna know why people do that...?
It's because people are stuck inside of like, a (30) year mortgage, where...
they have to make it an entire (30) years so they can own their house for like
(10) years while they're retired.

Yeh. So like, that's how it is, it's like...

01:12:18
Somebody who's a first time house buyer...? 
They buy the house...?
They spend the (30) years paying off the mortgage, and owning the house and everything...?
And then like, Oh, at some point, Oh.
They- they can't work anymore, so they gotta retire...?
So, did they save up for retirement too...?
Oh, they saved up for retirement too, oh, good. Ok. Good. So like...

01:12:41
Their retirement accounted for them to be able to uh-
Ya know, uh- be able to- ya know, buy breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next 
fuckin' (15) years...? And uh- you know uh-, maybe the maximum like, amount of 
like, leisure they have when they're that old...?

...is uh- going to the library.
Yeh.

01:13:06
So they go to the library and they study up on all the things that like,
[Michael Cook] was attempting to teach them, like (30) years before they retired...

And then they found out:
[Them]: Holy shit.
        That dude [Michael Cook] was onto something, why the hell didn't I 
        listen to him...?

Nah, here- here's the reality.
Some people um, they're gonna head ahead of all these things, and the way they're
gonna do it is by listening to guys like [Jeremy Rifken] FIRST, ya know...?

People aren't gonna wanna listen to a lot of the things I say FIRST, I understand
that. But, ya know, in order for me to be taken seriously from now until the 
future...?

Um, people have to understand that at some point, our system is gonna collapse.

It's not unlike how uh- uh, Rome collapsed, or uh Greece collapsed. 
The Roman Empire...? The Byzantine Empire...?
They collapsed...?

1:14:02
Why did these great empires collapse...?
Well, it's because like, humanity has a very [serious flaw].

And the flaw is, appearances- it's- eh, humanity operates on this notion,
[seeing is believing], and then like, but- they don't tell each other, often
enough, [but appearances can be deceiving].

So what I mean specifically, is like this...
You know, behind door number (1)...
Behind every door, there's gonna be a [hot girl], where you can have sex with her,
and have a bunch of kids.

But- they all have a [varying alternate attribute]. Right...?

Behind door number (1)...? Is the hot-dumb bitch.
The hot-dumb bitch...? She likes to lie a lot.
Every time that she opens her mouth, you never really know whether you can trust
what the hell she's saying...? But, she is fuckin' hot, dude.

Then uh- you don't know if you're gonna wind up getting divorced...?
Or, if your mortgage is gonna fall apart halfway through...?
Or if she's gonna like, try to stab you to death...?
Ya know, these are things that you're not gonna fuckin' know about...
...um, other than the fact that she is fuckin' dumb.

01:15:19
Right...? And then behind door number (2)...?
There is a smart girl. Smart girl...? 
Likes to be honest...?
Likes to tell the truth...?
She's very loyal, very obedient, and uh- she's got a lot goin' on for her
other than her looks, and uh- she isn't- thing is, is like, she's not
gonna tolerate being lied to.

You need to consistently tell her the truth at all times...?
And uh, in exchange for that, she is gonna be yours.

And you can have a LOT of kids with this girl, too...

01:15:57
Right...?
So, door number (1)...? 
Door number (2)...?
And, door number (3)...?
You've got the mixed bag.

You've got the hot-crazy wife matrix of doom, shit...
It's basically, a random, a randomly fuckin' generated value...
Nobody knows what the hell is behind door number (3)... 

You just know that it could be some hot, really dumb bitch...?
Or it could be some hot really smart bitch...
It could be, uhm, hot-dumb-loyal...?
Or, hot-smart-loyal...?

Or, hot-dumb and NOT loyal...
Or, hot-smart and NOT loyal...

Because all these properties matter.
Right...?

01:16:36
And, in order to understand like the true value of all these things, of all
these particular girls...? You have to have a [courting session] with them, 
so if like, most people in society, they just like, fuckin' uh- hook up with
the first girl that they see all the time...?

They're not gonna be able to understand whether that like, decision that they
make in one day...? Is gonna alter their future in (15-30) years.

Ya know, like um- 

01:17:12
The idea behind marriage, is like:
"Oh, as soon as you get married to somebody, you're like TIED to somebody."

And uh- another thing behind marriage is like, how much money goes into like,
a relationship or whatever. Right...?

So, all these things that I've said, they don't account for the regrets
people have later in life.

01:17:38
Right, some people, they're gonna be like, uh- reluctant to- to say, whether
they regret something or not...? Because like, they might make it like (20) 
years through their mortgage and pay off their house and everything, but- 

You know what...?
They're like, upset with themselves, because they realized that if they made
a couple of other choices that weren't so risky, they could've uh- had a plan
for success that didn't involve screwing over other people or lying to them, 
but it involved just manufacturing something that was uh- gonna produce a lot
less waste, that was gonna be renewable...?

And it offered some smart ways to improve their quality of life...?

01:18:33
So these things are very important, because, like...

We have this technology now, it's the first time in human civilization, where
we can really fine tune the amount of things that are being wasted, and- 
that's what the future holds.

The future holds, the idea that uh- humans have to be more resourceful, less
wasteful, and uh- to uh- to start to filter out the properties that they believe
and don't believe. And what- from what I can tell, like there's a lot of people
in the government that like, continue to be lobbied by some rich bastard who's
corrupt.

01:19:09
And like, they act like [Joe Manchin], and [Joe Manchin], or [Paul Manchin], 
he's gonna continue to say:

[Manchin]: I don't like the student loan forgiveness package of doom...
           Nah, I don't like the way it looks.

Nah, there's a reason why he's sayin' he doesn't like the way it looks.
It's because a lot of people all around the country, that have been giving,
that have been sucking off of like, somebody's fuckin' teat...?

Ohhhh, they don't like the idea of the teat being taken away forcibly, and
so what they're gonna do, is they're gonna use every fuckin' tool at their
disposal, to continue being like the slave masters back in the 1800's.

01:19:45
Yeah.
That is, effectively what uh- our society does right now.
Right...? A lot of people in our society, they don't realize that like, 
they operate exactly, in a nearly identical way to how the slaves used to
operate, except, the way that it's different now, is like, instead of slaves
workin' for free, they're getting like, paid, and they get housing and 
everything... well, um...

01:20:08
Now, like everybody is like forced to like, live around the poverty line or 
below or above, or whatever. They do a really good job of makin' it seem like
they give a shit about the every-day ordinary citizen...?

But- I'm pretty sure that they don't, because, you know, situations like Richard
Sackler... Richard Sackler can like, uh- make this drug that is very addictive,
and it got a lot of people addicted, it got a whole industry like, screwed up...

And uh...

1:20:47
Ya know, the legacy of Richard Sackler is not a good one...
But there are a lot of people that will basically chortle on his nutsack, and
like, do whatever the hell he tells them to. There's a lot of people in the
government that do that shit.

For Richard Sackler.
They'll jump in front of a bullet for Richard Sackler.
Or, maybe they won't.

Ya know, they'll be like:
[Them]: Well, I wouldn't jump in front of a bullet for Richard Sackler, but...
        Ya know, if he's gonna throw me a stack of (50,000) dollars...?
        I'll fuckin' take it...
        And then uh- I'll just tell like, everybody that tries to attack Richard
        Sackler to fuck off... And then, I'll shoot them...
        
01:21:31
Yeh, so like, what I'm- so- alluding to, is like, Richard Sackler has his own
security team. Ah- uh, more than likely. Ya know, he's got enough money to
fuckin' pay for... enough weapons, and uh- ammunition, to like, keep himself
like protected...?

Ya know, he's not gonna be- people aren't gonna think well of Richard Sackler
for the forseeable future, but ya know, his life, uh- it's protected.

Right...?
A lot of people work to protect him, and uh- ya know, a lot of people in
the government, have worked to uh- effectively what I'm alluding to is this,
like money causes people to act pretty fuckin' stupid sometimes.

01:22:14
Ya know, I don't wanna say it's a consistent case where like, money causes
thi- think or do stupid shit... But, it's often enough to where like, sometimes
you can ask somebody, "Would you suck some dude's dick for a million dollars...?"

And then like, ya know somebody might say:
[Somebody]: Yeah, I'll do that.

And it's like:
[You]     : Well, what if I record it on video...?

Then they'll change their answer, and be like:
[Somebody]: No no no, no no no, not if you're recordin' it on video...
            ...then I wouldn't.
            Nah nah nah, I wouldn't suck-
            Wouldn't suck some guys dick for a million dollars if uh-
            you were recording a video of it...
[You]     : Well, why not...?

01:22:45
[Somebody]: Uh, cause I wouldn't want other people to see that video.
[You]     : But you said that you would do it for a million dollars...?
[Somebody]: Not if other people could see it, though.
[You]     : Well, why not...?
[Somebody]: Well, because other people would be able to see me suckin'
            some dude's dick for a million dollars. And then-
[You]     : Oh, well, but I mean... 
            Why would that change your mind...?
[Somebody]: Because other people would see it.
[You]     : Oh, well, just because other people could see it, doesn't,
            ya know, well, how, why does that change your mind...?
[Somebody]: Because other people would see it, and they would realize
            that I sucked some dude's dick for a million dollars.
[You]     : Oh, so if other people SEE it, then you wouldn't do it...
[Somebody]: Right.
[You]     : Alright.

01:23:21
So, the concept there, is that as long as people can do things where they're
not being seen...? Uh, then they'll continue to do those things, because
they're not being seen.

And, the problem with humanity, is this... right...?

There exists, a dimension above us, where all of the decisions that we have
ever made, for our entire life have already been seen and witnessed, and
categorized, and uh- ya know, some people are really stupid...?

And they think that is babbledy-gook, and those are the types of people
that like to suck somebody's dude's- somebody's dick, for a million dollars,
as long as they're not recorded or seen doing it.

01:24:04
Yeah, so the concept that I'm alluding to is like, we live in a certain 
dimension, and uh- I'm gonna touch on this Carl Sagan metaphor here, right...?

So Carl Sagan, he's like:
[Sagan]: You get a bunch of 2D flatlanders, right...?
         And then you get a sphere, and then you take the sphere, which
         is a (3) dimensional object, and then you have to cut it into slices
         so that the 2D flatlanders can understand the 3D sphere.
         Right...? And as the fuckin' 3D sphere passes through the- 
         the flatlander's world...?
         Then uh- the- the flatlanders are all like:
         "Holy shit~! What the hell is that thing...?"
         And then they're like:
         "Holy shit, that thing is fuckin' weird..."

And then like, you know, uh- the same concept applies to how uh- a lot of people
in our society...? 

01:24:58
They think that as long as nobody sees what they do- the decisions that they make,
that there's no way that anyone could- would ever know. And that's why, like that's
what's so dangerous about humanity, is that there are- some people who think that...?

They're fuckin' stupid.
Ya know...?
It's not like every single decision that somebody makes, is gonna cause, is gonna
cause someone like me to think that they're fuckin' stupid for makin' that decision
knowing that no one could SEE what they were doing and that no one would ever know...

Right...?
But- certain decisions that these people make, cause other people to have to keep
skeletons in their closet, and basically like uh suck on somebody's dick, for a
million dollars, and that's-

01:25:45
They're gonna continue to do it, because people aren't able to see them doing it, 
they're doing it within the shadows.

And as long as nobody knows that they're doin' it in the shadows...?
They're just gonna keep doin' it...?
And no one is ever gonna stop them.

Unless...

01:26:02
People wise up.
And they listen to some of the things I'm attempting to educate other people.
There are ways to see things, that other people, like, will say:

[Someone]: There's no way that they would know, that I made some decision,
           as long as they didn't see it...
           
Well, you really don't need to like, be able to see anything, other than like uh- 
know that the same- the metaphor that I r- that I rose earlier, the analogy that
I rose earlier, about like the smell...?
Of uh- the body spray, on my slice of pizza, from within the bag...?

01:26:36
It's the same concept to like:
[Somebody]: No one will ever know that I sucked some dude's
            dick for a million dollars...

Yeah.
Someone WILL know, it's just that like, your idea of knowing something...?
Is like, basically seeing it.
And that would be knowing something.

But- that's just an opinion.
That is just a fuckin' opinion, dude.

1:27:05
Some people, they do this, where they're gonna fuckin' suck some dude's dick
for a million dollars, as long as nobody sees it.

But if you ask them the same question:

[You]     : What if I record it on video...?
[Somebody]: No no no, no no, I would NOT suck some dude's dick for a million
            dollars if people saw it.
[You]     : Oh...

01:27:26
Well, that's a problem because basically, shedding some light on the subject
causes somebody to change their decision making process.

Huh...
That's a fuckin' problem.

End log.
